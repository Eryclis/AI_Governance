    > We need to split the documents up since the size of them might be affecting the embedding model and consequently the topic model. 
        - The BERTopic author suggest the use of NLTK's sentence splitter.
        - We can also use Langchain for splitting.

        - We can use our previous project (Network Analysis) as reference for coding.
    
    
    
    
    > After splitting, apply an embedding model and use it to speed the topic model training up.

    > There are some erros in the data cleaning step. Probably, we should consider using Langchain to extract the data instead of OCR given that we are dealing with PDF docs. 
    > For the Data Cleaning step, we do not have to remove stopwords. Some authors recommend just do it after the embedding generation and clustering.

    > Now, it is time to fine tuning  /  Training a model with our entire dataset instead of just a sampling

    # Insights from the current topics and visualization:
        a. many overlaps between clusters
        b. Countries names does not have a real contribution. Consider take it off;
        c. REFLECTION about the proportions of the documents. Some docs are much smaller then others, then how does it work its representation in front of the model?

    > Reviewing the cleaning step.
    
    > Tasks:
        > Customize the list of stopwords => remove name of Countries and very repeated names (AI, data, datum)
        > Use a LLM to represent the topics (llama, openai, etc)

    > Finetuning:
        - HDBSCAN: clustering algo. 'min_cluster_size' and 'min_samples'.

    > My experiments showed that OCR has more precision that Langchain in terms of extract text data from PDF.
    > Langchain = Better in removing other language from the text
    > OCR = nao remove a lingua estrangeira, mas eh mlhr para evitar palavras coladas.



        - Use OCR to extract, and Langchain to split the documents up.
        - Fixing OCR errors:
            - Terms like: SCAN, SCANhere, SCAN here,
