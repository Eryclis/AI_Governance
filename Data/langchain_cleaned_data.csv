Data sourcing and preparation which is part of the project development can be a continuous exercise. This is because an AI model can often benefit from better or more data for iterative model training throughout the development process.

Errors are natural and even helpful for our understanding. Although sometimes the cost in time and money might increase, it should still be considered a milestone for progress. Governments and companies hoping to use AI also need to focus on innovatio n, critical thinking, and STEM in their educational system. External subject matter experts will certainly be able to help with data formatting and processing algorithms. However, experts who understand the underlying data and principles of how the infor mation might be best used are in a key position to maximi se the impact and profitability of this new technology Mackinsey Global Institute,  .

1203," Also, there has been much written about how AI will take jobs away f rom unskilled or easily automated workers. This can especially be seen in Cambodia where industries are still labor intensive An,  and have low economy ofscale in terms of market size. This means that most of these industries would not allow Cambodian businesses to afford advanced automated and robotic m achines that are made available by AI technology. This typically leads to hesitation to invest and experiment with AI. However, AI brings other opportunities, especially in the early stages of transition. One example in education involves the potential confusion between the student and the AI programs design. The implementation of AI based learning systems in China, for example, required the hiring of hundreds of tutors to help students during the implementation of their lessons.

1207," steps. It has been well documented that porting curriculum content into usable AI based frameworks is challenging and expensive. Also, identifying laddering technologies that serve to identify students level of understanding has additional complexities. For example , a student that understands how to do addition but struggles with multiplication naturally needs specific, individuali sed attention in multiplication. This requires lessons to be linked in a sophisticated manner that is machine readable and integrated ac ross curriculums. Implementing a knowledge tree for such students involves an efficient network of lessons that require advanced skills, an in depth knowledge of databases, and a solid understanding of the interplay within such systems to see how the AI model will respond to the sum total of its overall usage.

For instance, we witnessed the emergence of nextgeneration AIpowered natural text generators like GPT, which can generate passages that are difficult to distinguish from human writing. We also saw the development of Dactyl, a robotic hand, which uses reinforcement learning to grasp and manipulate common household objects with humanlike dexterity. These examples attest to the speed of AIs advancement and how it will become ubiquitous in our daily lives. The discourse on AI ethics and governance has also moved forward.

The Model Framework focuses primarily on four broad areas internal governance structures and measures, human involvement in AIaugmented decisionmaking, operations management and stakeholder interaction and communication. While the Model Framework is certainly not limited in ambition, it is ultimately limited by form, purpose and practical considerations of scope. With that in mind, several caveats bear mentioning. The Model Framework is  a. Algorithmagnostic It does not focus on specific AI or data analytics methodology. It applies to the design, application and use of AI in general. b. Technologyagnostic It does not focus on specific systems, software or technology, and will apply regardless of development language and data storage method. c.

1266,"MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  . It is recognised that there are a number of issues that are closely interrelated to the ethical use and deployment of AI. This Model Framework does not focus on these specific issues, which are often sufficient in scope to warrant separate study and treatment. Examples of these issues include a. Articulating a new set of ethical principles for AI. There are already a number of attempts globally in establishing a universal set of principles. While a consistent core set of ethical principles is emerging, there is also a penumbra of variation across cultures, jurisdictions and industry sectors.

An algorithm deployed in an AI solution is said to be explainable if how it functions and how it arrives at a particular prediction can be explained. When an algorithm cannot be explained, understanding and trust can still be built by explaining how predictions play a role in the decisionmaking process. . Organisations deploying AI solutions are recommended to adopt the following practices Model training and selection are necessary for developing an intelligent system i.e. a system that contains AI technologies.

Robustness refers to the ability of a computer system to cope with errors during execution and erroneous input, and is assessed by the degree to which a system or component can function correctly in the presence of invalid input or stressful environmental conditions. Ensuring that deployed models are sufficiently robust will contribute towards building trust in the AI system. . The concept of robustness arises because it is not possible for models to be able to enumerate and set out all preconditions and consequences for an action. This creates the possibility of models producing insensible or unexpected results even with minor modifications to input data that may not even be perceptible to humans. Testing for robustness can be achieved through scenariobased testing for foreseeable erroneous input.

No model can be perfectly robust as it is not possible to detect all possible modifications to a set of input data.

This allows organisations to refresh models based on updated training datasets that incorporate new input data. Model tuning may also be necessary when commercial objectives, risks, or corporate values change. . Wherever possible, testing should reflect the dynamism of the planned production environment. To ensure safety, testing may need to assess the degree to which an AI solution generalises well and fails gracefully.

These organisations may wish to consider setting out certain acceptable user policies  AUPs  to ensure that users do not maliciously introduce input data that unacceptably manipulates the performance andor results of the solutions model. This is pertinent, given past examples of AI chatbot systems that have been unduly manipulated to issue publicly unacceptable responses. . In this regard, AUPs serve to set broad boundaries for the interactions that individuals can perform with the AI system, such as restrictions with regard to intentional actions or attempts to reverse engineer, disable, interfere or disrupt the functionality, integrity or performance of the AIpowered service.

RandD and Utilization Principles of AI Figure  Overall Structure of This Document  An AI Ready Society means that society as a whole has undergone the necessary changes to maximize the benefits of AI, enjoys the benefits of AI, or has introduced AI i mmediately when needed and is in a state of being able to receive the benefits. It means a society adapted to the use of AI. For this purpose, society as a whole needs to be transformed, including individuals, business organizations, and the social innov ation environment. Individually, for example, everyone should acquire appropriate AI literacy that allows them to use AI for work and life. In business organizations, meanwhile, corporate activities should be developed with strategies premised on the use o f AI.

1417,"  Basic Philosophy AI is expected to contribute significantly to the realization of Society .. We consider AI important not only to return the benefits obtained from the efficiency and convenience of using AI to people and society, but also to use AI for the public good of humanity as a whole , and to ensure global sustainability outlined in the SDGs through qualitative changes in socia l conditions and true innovation. We believe we should respect the following three values as our philosophy and build a society that pursues their realization.  Dignity  A society that has respect for human dignity We should not build a society where humans are overly dependent on AI or where AI is used to control human behavior through the excessive pursuit of efficiency and convenience.

Diversity and Inclusion  A society where people with diverse backgrounds can pursue their own well being It is both an ideal in the modern world and a major challenge to create a society in which people with diverse backgrounds, values and ways of thinking can pursue their own wellbeing while society creates new v alue by flexibly embracing them. AI is a technology powerful enough to bring us closer to this ideal. We need to change the nature of society in this way through the appropriate development and deployment of AI.

1420,"  Social Changes Needed to Realize Society . AI Ready Society Technologies expected to contribute to the realization of Society . include AI, IoT, Robotics, and ultra highspeed broadband communication networks. Even if it becomes possible to some extent to entrust complex processes to machines using AI, it is still necessary for humans to set objectives that answer the question What are we using AI for? While AI can be used to better society, it might also be used for undesirable purposes or in inappropriate ways unconsciously. For this reason, we are advancing technological developments in terms of Human Potential, S ocial Systems, Industrial Structures, Innovation Systems, and Governance which can answer the question What are we using AI for? while paying close attention to their interactio n with the progress of technology.

Human Potential In an AI Ready Society that is responsive to the spread of AI to every corner of society, how human beings respond to AI is the key to realizing a society where AI can be fully utilized. T o that end, the expected abilities and roles of people are as follows. A People should fully understand the advantages and disadvantag es of AI. In particular, people should have the ability to recognize that biases are included in the algorithms andor data that will become the information resources of AI, and for example, that these biases may be used for undesirable purposes.

To that end, it is expected that a diverse range of people will acquire the ability to realize their own dreams and ideas with AI's support despite many differences in origin, culture, taste , and so on. An education system that achieve s these goals as well as social systems that contribute to their achievement must be realized. C It is important to have sufficient human resources with acquired application skills such as implementation and design of AI systems and a basic knowledge of data and AI .

Given the establishment of such a living environment, we must implement social system s that allow many people to live a richer and more fulfi lling life .  Social Systems The use of AI will most likely accelerate the evolution of individual service solutions and create various benefits from improved efficiency and individualization. In order to embrace the full benefits of this change in society, it is necessary for entire social systems including health care, finance, insurance , transportation, energy, and others to flexibly change and respond to the evolution of AI.

Industrial Structures In order for a diverse group of people to realize their assorted dreams and ideas, it is necessary for labor as well as employment and entrepreneur environments to be flexible and internationally open. For this reason, companies should compete fairly and p romote flexible working style s, human creativity should continually be demonstrated throughout industries , and investment in start up businesses should be promoted.

To that end, all types of data including real space data should be instantaneously and securely available at a l evel that AI can analyze. Additionally, it is advisable to ensure privacy and security so that everyone can provide and distribute data with ease, and for there to be an environment where they can benefit from the data that they have provided. It is advisable to accelerate the desired development of AI by establishing an environment in which those involved in RandD , including users, can safely conduct RandD and utilization of AI, and the cycle of RandD and utilization can move rapidly.

Social Principles of AI Social Pri nciples of AI are principles relating to social frameworks that should be implemented across Japan ese society including national and local governments as well as in multilateral frameworks in an AI Ready Society.  The Human Centric Principle The utilization of AI must not infringe upon the fundamental human rights guaranteed by the Constitution and international standards . AI should be developed, utilized, and implemented in society to expand the abilities of people and allow diverse people to pur sue their own well being.

AI can expand human abilities and creativity not only by replacing aspects of human labor but also by assisting humans as a technologi cally advanced tool.  When using AI, people must judge and decide for themselves how to use it . The appropriate stakeholders involved in the developme nt, delivery and utilization of AI should be responsible for the consequences of AI utilization, depending on the nature of the problem.  In the process of AI deployment , each stakeholder should take into co nsideration the user friendliness of the system in order to allow all people to enjoy the benefits of AI and avoid creating a digital divide with socalled information poor or technology poor  people left behind.

Among those with a degree of familiarity to AI, concern about employee backlash due to the pace of change and job displacement tends to be an inhibitory factor.  Lack of Knowledge on Pot ential Use Cases . Perhaps another reason local industries and other organizations lack an understanding of the field of analytics is the scarcity of information on potential use cases of AI. While many concrete examples exist outside of the Philippines that are readily accessible via the news and from online resources, many local enterprises cannot connect or relate to these examples. Many still seem far fetched to local enterprises and the workforce.

Such systems have been successful in using a large number of features to make complex and sometimes consequential decisions but without exposing the underlying rationale. In traditional statistical approaches, human programmers influence the choice of parameters and the mechanism to influence a prediction. In AI systems, input to the model called features are provided along with the correct output through annotated labels during the training.

There are various examples for such decisionscredit scoring, fraud detection, loan eligibility, insurance qualification, access to Government services, etc. As algorithms make these decisions, very often, an end user has an expectation of factual assessment.

This can lead to inconsistent output across a diverse demography who are otherwise similarly placed. Real life manifestations of such bias tie into historically discriminatory behaviour, where members of a certain caste, class, sex or sexual orientation, among others, are denied opportunities on the basis of an identifying characteristic even though they are completely similar in all ways relevant to the decision being made.

Qatar should develop guidelines for data sharing that encourage people with data to share it and make clear the best practices for doing so. The guidelines should spell out the obligations of the receiver of the data. For government entities, these guidelines can be elevated to be mandatory policies.  Qatar should launch and lead multilateral level diplomatic efforts for datasharing among countries with small populations. For most countries including Qatar, developing successful AI applications that can generate export revenue wont be possible without greater data sharing at a global level.

The extreme view is that AI technology will result in massive employment disruption as many tasks that currently require human involvement have the potential of being replaced by AI. In a highly cited work carried out by researchers at Oxford University, over  of jobs in the US are under risk of becoming automated9. Economic theory suggests that the longterm financial returns on capital tend to be higher than labor and thus those who own capital will benefit disproportionately from AI technology.

Similarly Qatar is home to people from over eighty countries and there are at least eight large subpopulations which speak distinct languages. An AIbased speech and language translation system for medical communication can be built bottom up in Qatar and exported to the rest of the world. However, the more humaninteraction aspects of the nurse and patient relationship cannot be automated and Qatari residents can be trained to carry out this particular aspect of the nursing function.

It is hard to predict what new applications will emerge that will take advantage of the emerging AI technology. What remains constant is that economics is often the key driver of technology adoption. One of the factors affecting the cost of adopting AI in Qatar compared to other countries is the ability of Qatar to import low cost labor from the developing world. Thus, the cost of labor intensive and inefficient solutions is often less than the cost of an AI solution leading to a situation where longterm efficiencies are sacrificed for shortterm benefits.
