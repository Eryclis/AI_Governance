foreword through its continued efforts toward the early realization of the digital pakistan vision of the government of pakistan, the ministry of it and telecom is committed to providing its people with timely and equal access to opportunities by stimulating culture of innovation through an overarching developmental agenda orchestrated to embrace cutting-edge   technologies such as artificial   intelligence   efficiently and responsibly: in this regard, the artificial intelligence (al) policy is a pivotal milestone for transforming pakistan into a knowledge-based economy as it spells out national strategy to establish an ecosystem necessary for al adoption by harnessing an agile framework for addressing different aspects of unique user journeys encompassing different market horizontals and industry verticals by ensuring responsible use of ai. furthermore, the policy aims to go beyond the meagre approach of adopting technology to fundamentally rethink al adoption in the local context so that new growth areas can be identified and intervened in considering the existing job market's relevance while empathizing with the growing population of the country: this policy stems from the ""al for good"" initiative by the international telecommunication union and the sustainable development goals set forth by the united nations. considering the disruptive nature of al and allied technologies and how it is re-ordering the socio- economic construct of the world, we desire to live in. therefore, it is essential to responsibly harness this opportunity while keeping the interest of a common person foremost: therefore, to survive and thrive, pakistan aims to revitalize its resolve toward digitalization, which will involve processing personal data through al. to this end,the said policy coherently interlaces with the personal data protection act, pakistan cloud first policy, and the digital pakistan policy initiatives. 



executive summary pakistan has a unique opportunity to harness digital disruption by educating an eager young population that can potentially   propel the nation onto growth trajectory to sustain our future national competitiveness and improve the lives of citizens. artificial intelligence (al) represents the next frontier of technological opportunities, and it has been widely proven and understood that the collection, processing, use, and exchange of data through automated/intelligent means would drive the entire society into the next stage of its evolution which is unprecedented and requires a progressive, yet careful approach: so, after a thorough analysis of the global perspective and based on the evidence collected through more extensive consultations with the stakeholders, the ministry of it and telecom has come to much-desired conclusion that it needs to chalk out a developmental roadmap for better, faster and responsible adoption of alin the country: for that, the policy document is put in place to reap long-term and sustainable benefits for its people. the policy document offers wide range of developmental initiatives necessary for awareness and adoption, reimagining the transparent and fair use of personal data using al and stimulating innovation through industry-academia collaborations and investments in al-led initiatives. the national al policy is crafted to focus on the equitable distribution of opportunity and its responsible use, having the following defining attributes. evidence-based and target oriented user-centric and forward-looking objective and overarching the al policy further aims to augment al and allied technologies through balanced demand and supply- side interventions, as briefly described below: market enablement establishment of research and innovation centers in al for developing, test- bedding, deploying, and scaling al solutions. this includes learning how to improve governance and manage the impact of al: progressive and trusted environment responsible use of al to generate economic gains and improve lives. in addition, al will raise the government's capability to deliver anticipatory and personalized services enabling ai through awareness and readiness pakistan shall increase awareness and understanding of al technologies and their benefits; our workforce will be equipped with the necessary competencies to participate in the al economy_ transformation and evolution transformation of sectors and industries towards effective use of al, facilitated by national it boards through creating awareness and offering training programs through sectoral cooperation.



 introduction and context . why pakistan needs ai policy the need for national al policy is to create a broad-based awareness ofthe use f al-based platforms while keeping privacy at the forefront; upskilling human capital on al and allied technologies, guiding investment in al research and development, ensuring ethical and responsible use of al, and provide a framework for addressing the challenges and risks associated with the socio-economic outfit of the country: the al policy covers the following areas, including: investment in research and development infrastructure: pakistan should invest in research and development to build in-house al capabilities required for application development based on local data. this investment should include funding for establishing research organizations that have a sustainable mandate of basic research, data standardization, providing support to the government for   regulatory and  legal interventions   regarding al; maintaining central   computational infrastructure, data storage facilities, and partnerships with universities and research institutions both domestically and internationally: this investment should also include training programs to build the necessary technical expertise: the al policy outlines how pakistan must collaborate with other countries to share best practices and expertise in al: ethical and responsible use: the al policy proposed the establishment of an al regulatory directorate that ensures the ethical and responsible use of al. this includes ensuring that al is not used to discriminate against individuals or groups and that its use is transparent and accountable. job displacement: the al policy addresses the potential job displacement that could result from the global proliferation of al: this includes investing in training programs to help existing and new workforce acquire the skills to adapt to changing job requirements. al can help to promote economic growth by encouraging investment in al research and development: this investment can lead to the creation of new jobs and industries, as well as improved productivity and efficiency: al policy can help address social and economic challenges by improving healthcare outcomes, providing better access to education, and addressing food security challenges. al policy can help ensure that al's benefits are shared equitably across society. this includes addressing issues such as bias and discrimination and ensuring that the benefits of al are not concentrated in the hands of a few. . the state of al in pakistan pakistan has a population of  million as of  and is predicted to reach  million by  [], with current literacy rate of around .% []. moreover, pakistan is considered the fifth largest country in the world in terms of the young population; % of the nation is younger than  []. with such a propelling number of employable human capital, we have enormous development potential on one end and tremendous responsibility on the other. nevertheless, despite all the odds, pakistan has been able to register notable efforts through public/private interventions as follows: presidential initiative for artificial intelligence and computing (piaic) center for artificial intelligence and computing (centaic) national center of artificial intelligence (ncai) sino-pak center for artificial intelligence (spcai) these timely initiatives have performed well in their domains and need continuity to achieve long-term targets. to achieve the al-accelerated socio-economic development urgently required by pakistan and its actual impact on the gdp ofthe country, a national strategy for aladoption is critical: the al policy provides holistic structure, by the societal challenges regarding al adoption can be addressed by establishing the necessary ecosystem with specialized initiatives and organizational responsibilities. the policy proposes the national al fund as a perpetual and central fund to support the proposed interventions. key



 vision, scope and objectives . vision owing to the impact of al globally and its local adoption and implications, the government of pakistan envisions: ""to embrace al by appreciating human intelligence and stimulating a hybrid intelligence ecosystem for equitable, responsible, and transparent use of ai. . scope the policy framework is envisaged to provide a complete al-enabling ecosystem in pakistan, covering all aspects of awareness, skill development, standardization, and ethical use_ . objectives here the strategic objectives are distributed into two societal agendas of development and responsibility to efficiently evolve the society in the age of the fourth industrial revolution: developmental agenda responsibility agenda (embracing (appreciating human intelligence) training and upskilling human capital in al at all levels to address the needs and demands of the ensure the ethical use of al through inclusive and market efficiently: forward-looking guidelines: integrating al into the national curriculums at all levels is essential from a necessity, application, and use standpoint: provide an enabling platform for al with appropriate increasing public awareness to facilitate the sandbox and agile regulatory arrangements to adoption of al sustainably: address societal and regulatory challenges (only where necessary): to embrace research and innovation-based culture, offer fiscal/non-fiscal incentives to start-ups/smes define data standards and invest in computational investing in al-based services/technologies: resources for  the  responsible use of  organized datasets. strengthen international   collaboration with both academia and industry: . policy drivers and targets the policy drivers help navigate the identified gaps and challenges by orchestrating journey-based approach comprising four defining pillars of development and responsibility, complimented by progressive targets for effective policy implementation. .. the drivers through the challenges and gaps, the policy lays a fundamental framework driven through a pillar-based approach driven through the developmental journey of al adoption and proliferation using agile and all- inclusive models incrementally: these drivers are:  ai)



... 1st pillar: enabling al through awareness and readiness the first pillar will focus on societal preparation in becoming increasingly aware of the potential benefits of al, deployment requirements, and adopting measures for establishing readiness towards al adoption: targeted interventions achieve this in meeting the societal gaps_ the interventions include awareness proliferation programs related to al, improving the quality of randd in al through applied research, and further enhancing the footprint in al through fiscal/logistical support, curriculum development, and review of existing coursework to make it more relevant to global demand and best practices. furthermore, the upskilling of the current workforce shall be done through bootcamps and high-impact short courses using massive open online courses (moocs) platforms: the initiative aims to meet the societal gaps of awareness and adaptation challenges (g1). ... pillar: al market enablement the second pillar will help organize matters related to establishing an ecosystem to facilitate the development and deployment of al. this includes steps taken to address the identified societal challenges, including awareness and adaptation challenges (g1), data standardization and accessibility (g2), and computational needs (g3). ... 3rd pillar: building progressive and trusted environment the third pillar focuses on the interventions necessary for building a progressive and trusted environment where the personal data of citizens and the data of organizations are protected: this section addresses awareness and adaptation challenges (g1) and ethical challenges (g4) to ensure the safe and responsible use of al and associated technologies ... 4th pillar: transformation and evolution this pillar focuses on developing roadmaps for each sector of society, including governance, so the necessary evolution toward al adoption can be achieved: during the process, several interventions are highlighted to facilitate this transformation, including industrial transformation and sandboxing: in addition, this driver will assist us in addressing awareness and adaptation challenges (g1) and data standardization and accessibility (g2). .. the national al targets navigating through the policy drivers, the national al targets reflect the needs and concerns which will be addressed through subsequent policy interventions with definite yet simple approach presenting bandwagon of tangible opportunities having the following attributes: the proposed targets are highly focused and inclusive: b the said targets are simple, realistic, and achievable: the targets offer a reasonable amount of time for its initiation and achieving desired results with impact registration: d. the offered targets can be reviewed quantifiably: e_ as explained later in the document, special consideration is given to agility for implementing different programs, so holistic approach toward al adoption could be exercised: f the targets are based on the international developmental agenda for al and best practices, which will allow recognition of pakistan on the global front: 2nd

. market challenges the evidence furnished above simplifies the identification of challenges leading to pragmatic market support and only necessary interventions. these challenges are: ... g1 awareness and adaptation challenges it is becoming increasingly important that society is aware of the potential of al in solving routine matters this requires an awareness campaign towards controlling and sharing data, basic skills education, and high-impact skilling at all levels of the community for sustainable growth: nations dominating the al and allied technologies arena have instituted well-defined human capital development and evolution mechanisms to prepare the future generation for al adoption in various sectors through  sizable public/private investments and to retain the talent locally: moreover, international universities have inculcated al-based curricula in their primary, high- school, undergraduate, and post-graduate programs to ensure that al is adopted in a structured manner offering comprehensive development plan for its role in different phases of life and work in pakistan, enabling al and allied technologies is challenging without having basic level of awareness about the technology at the user level. it should be complemented with skilled human resources, having a broader understanding of how and where al should be applied and the best practices in this technology for its effective and responsible use. the major hurdle in preparing al- trained human capital is the access to data needed to train them in various domains of al-based technologies. hence, data is the underlying artefact for putting skilled human capital to work and making them experiment with using al-based models in a controlled yet agile environment: im. al adoption would disrupt how work will be done in public and private sectors and various industries, directly affecting the country's socio-economic fabric; people working in traditional ways and not skilled in al-based technologies are at risk of losing their jobs if not pivoted timely: this issue must be addressed on priority basis, which can only be done through awareness and upskilling: customized learning programs, workshops, and courses can assist such individuals in surviving this transition and becoming an integral part of digitally transformed workplaces. iv. according to the surveys, at a sectoral scale, half of the respondents are well versed with al and related technologies, while the other half possess working knowledge. to teach an al-based curriculum, the survey findings point to including short courses and - month-long boot camps/diplomas urgently. furthermore, bachelor's/master's level programs and ph.d. degrees in al are also worth considering: the significant adaptation challenges towards al proliferation include digitization of information, digital access, literacy, and digital inclusion by design: heaps of data are available in the public and private sectors, either difficult to access or not available appropriately (such as in hard copies): in many cases, it has been observed that data digitalization and basic process automation in confined environment are considered sufficient due to a lack of awareness_ alternatively, cloud- based solutions using al for data/process orchestration, management, and analytics offered as saas provides greater access. however, with limited knowledge, such services are never done justice in terms of their utilization. moreover, in several cases, local smes and enterprises are not using al and allied technologies effectively, leading to demand-side paralysis. for instance, digitizing healthcare-related data is essential in getting patients' history accessible to the doctors as well as various diagnostic and randd. unfortunately, the healthcare sector is digitized at fundamental level with limited or zero technological transformation and the standardization of data, which is a significant hurdle in enabling al-based advancement in the healthcare sector. vi. digital literacy is another challenge as people are to be educated about data digitization and accessibility and how to adopt safe data-sharing mechanisms. moreover, it needs to be organized 



to allow equal opportunity for children, women from remote areas, and disabled persons to benefit from the al proliferation efforts and meet future challenges ... g2 data standardization and accessibility globally, leaders in al proliferation have made data standardization and accessibility their top priority. for example, china used the vast datasets available from the provinces to train al and allied technologies, especially in the healthcare sector. as a result; it took the burden from the hospitals and medical practitioners. estonia is another shining example of data standardization and accessibility that enabled the small european country to lead in al adoption. organizations obtain data from several resources ifthis data from disparate sources is not brought to common operating environment, it will create significant problems in its processing for different purposes and uses therefore, pakistan'$ primary issue is to digitize and organize the massive datasets available in various inaccessible forms and make them available in a standardized form to make them more relevant for data analytics and other data processing mechanisms. this is only achievable through sustainable developmental hubs and associated collaborations in different sectors. i. data standardization has been done in the financial sector according to international standards to retain a competitive edge: most companies in the it industry have also ensured standardization and accessibility: however, as learned through the survey, other sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, retail and commerce, and healthcare lag significantly in this domain. significant efforts are required to develop andaugment an ecosystem that catalyzes the countrys adoption of aland allied technologies moreover, the lack of accessibility to data hinders al-based randd, predictive analytics, and various other al-based technologies from producing valuable outputs. it adversely affects advancement in research and development and al proliferation: the survey results report: a. the lack of accessibility of data has been pointed out by % of the stakeholders, which is a prerequisite to al adoption in any sector. b % of the stakeholders shared their concerns about data not being standardized: c. % of respondents consider poor data collection practices a crippling factor for successful al adoption. d  of the stakeholders recommend following leaders in al adoption, such as the uk, estonia, and china, for data standardization mechanisms: ... g3 computational infrastructure situation and needs developed countries and the countries which have made significant progress in al proliferation have ensured the availability of computational equipment and facilities to the stakeholders and institutions to train the human capital and streamline the modernization of processes to ensemble sustainable al outfit: however, such efforts need resources these countries have ensured and made available to the relevant stakeholders_ il. limited computational resources are a shared obstacle by various sectors of pakistan: the need for computational facilities is emphasized for providing robust and secure access to infrastructure for complex randd and high-performing systems. furthermore, these computational facilities are essential for any initiative to train human resources in al and allied technologies. their availability under one roof is necessary to streamline the training and learning process. il. similarly, in many cases, the computational resources are not used optimally. therefore, national/provincial data repository of all the public sector data can be made available to a broader audience via secure/controlled channel: there is also strong need for training on high- performance computing technologies so that indigenous customized solutions can meet local computational requirements within the country: 



iv. % of stakeholders have registered concerns regarding the limited availability of computational resources as a barrier to achieving a trained workforce in al and allied technologies. to augment applied research and provide robust and secure access to infrastructure for complex randd, computational facilities are considered vital by % of stakeholders. ... g4 ethical challenges safe and secure data sharing and ethical adoption of al and allied technologies are primary concerns for every stakeholder, national or international: at global level, various countries that have adopted al formulated guidelines and principles for the ethical use of al and related technologies and established regulatory framework to streamline safe and secure data-sharing mechanisms. regulatory challenges must be addressed to establish an environment of trust_ moreover, it is the users' fundamental right that their data be safe and that their privacy is always upheld. therefore, an effective regulatory system that may steer al adoption, related initiatives, and data-sharing mechanisms is needed: most stakeholders voted various risks associated with al adoption medium to high, including malicious intent; data pollution, data model theft, fairness, precision deterioration, invasion of privacy, etc_

. data in particular; has become an essential resource to countries, some calling it 'the new oil, to illustrate the tremendous opportunities it creates in terms of efficiency, development of al solutions, and public services a large number of data-generated opportunities create value, both social and financial. countries learning to maximize data collection opportunities, processing, and integration into valuable solutions, will significance, both in the short and long term_ ksa has a critical role in developing the data al agenda to position the country in the league of data-driven economies: ksa displays attractive characteristics to serve as our foundation for success_ we have a unique scale in industries and investment powerhouse with an appetite for the tech industry: we also have a thriving environment for test - beds in new/ smart cities such as neom and a unique data infrastructure with centralized ecosystem: in parallel, we are hosting key international events on data and al: to support this wide variety of efforts, saudi data and al authority (sdaia) has recently been established to support and drive the ksa data and al agenda: to capitalize on data and al for the kingdom economically and socially through national combined efforts by all stakeholders; sdaia has developed the national strategy for data and ai. this ecosystem will help us achieve our ambitious vision to be the place where the best of data and al is made reality:"" we will deploy our best capabilities to invest in the field: national strategy for data and al  gain



. we aim to achieve this ambitious long-term vision through a multi-phased approach focused on addressing the national priorities by , building foundations for competitive advantage in niche areas by , and becoming one of the leading economies utilizing and exporting data and al after . more concretely, the realization of this vision is based on six dimensions which; by the time it is fully achieved, would have ksa become: dimension : ambition the global hub where the best of data and al is made reality: we are aiming to be at the center of a large local and international network of partners dimension : skills the source of a steady local supply of data al talent dimension : policies and regulations top destination for data and al stakeholders by creating attractive and business-friendly policies and regulatory environment to achieve their full potential dimension : investment a place where investments are facilitated for the most promising data and al projects dimension : research and innovation an international platform for priority research and innovation (rel) activities in data and al topics to spearhead innovation and impact creation dimension : ecosystem the host of a groundbreaking and stimulating infrastructure to enable the realization of the data and al potential national strategy for data-and allz key key



. international landscape in data and al since the dartmouth summer research project on artificial intelligence in , where the term al was coined by professor john mccarty, data and al have mainly been fields of specialists in academic institutions, government, and private research organizations: however; the recent years have been characterized by a shift of interest towards the public sphere to include political actors, the general public, and private companies in nearly all sectors:



. two main trends have contributed to this shift: first, the extensive use of digital applications by the general public, such as natural language processing; has generated a significant amount of data essential to al development: the other factor has been the fast developments in computing capabilities; enabling the processing of increasingly large amounts of data: this development happened in parallel with significant advances in machine learning; a branch of al. data and al are already disrupting several sectors and will become a factor in economic development: while @ tremendous amount of opportunities are provided by al solutions (disaster management, road safety; or energy consumption management); some challenges are emerging (data protection; automation; cybersecurity): in order for societies to benefit from the opportunities provided by data and al and to address the challenges and threats they generate, governments have been framing their approach to support and regulate data and al. there are currently around  governments that have developed or are developing a national al strategy in the past two to three years: one of the central issues where government action is expected will be around data sharing and open data strategies: countries have adopted different approaches to collect, generate, and process data: countries also took strides in making public data available, ranging from limited data releases to open data by default: having large amounts of data available to public, private, academic, and research actors would provide economic benefits; increased citizens engagement; attractive environment for investors and accelerating innovation: for example, having access to data from municipalities can support local government in designing policies and public services taking into account the specific needs of populations: key key



. ksa's landscape including opportunities x challenges as a g20 country, it is necessary for ksa to bring its contribution and to benefit from the immense opportunities data and al would generate for the countrys development: becoming a key international actor in the field of data and al would require significant investments; upskilling and regulatory measures to create and enable the development of a domestic ecosystem ksas landscape including opportunities and challenges



. we are writing a new chapter for our generation and many others to come we acknowledge that data is the oil of the 21st century, and we have therefore set for our nation a clear vision to elevate the country to a leading position among the world's pioneering data and al-driven economies in fact; the large-scale transformation saudi arabia is going through under vision  requires the fast integration of the most advanced technological capabilities to accelerate the transition to achieve this vision efficiently, we need to make the right data-driven decisions, and this requires a lot of meaningful data, and the full power to unlock and to generate as many deep insights from the data as possible, and here comes the role of artificial intelligence. saudi arabia has long been recognized as powerhouse of the middle east: saudi displays several unique strategic advantages the potential lies in unique sectors at scale and investment powerhouse unique sectors at scale and an investment powerhouse with tech appetite through the public investment fund (pif) and the vision fund large scale transformation programs ksa's top leadership is committed to making change happen and to embrace the latest technologies young and vibrant population % of the population are under  years and are deeply entwined with the digital economy thriving environment for test-beds in newismart cities proliferation of new and smart cities such as neom that will provide opportunities to explore untested areas in data al ndtional strategy for dath and al | /

. as a result, this strategy would concentrate on the first phase this first phase is about maximizing the use cases of data and al to achieve the objectives set under vision  and accompany the transition and focus on key domains and niche topics to serve on the international scene. this includes supporting data and skills within both government and the private sector to prepare for @ growing labor market demand enhancing the regulatory environment to enable the development of a performing domestic ecosystem creating sector-specific data and al plans driving adoption of data management standards and policies across governement entities to collect data in readable and usable formats creating dynamic domestic and healthy data and al start-up ecosystem: this would require government support such as the establishment of a favorable regulatory environment; credit facilities and trainings building highly qualified national talents to respond to the needs of the market attracting sustained private and international investment into the saudi market elevating data and al rsi capabilities, quality and commercialization outcomes and establishing test-beds in new and smart cities building on the first phase would allow for setting the foundations for a new strategy after  to establish a data and al industry to compete on the global scene:



. our vision is translated into six strategic objectives: objective  position ksa as the global hub where the best of data € al is made reality ksa's vision as an international/regional hub for data and al activities requires solid presence on the global landscape of data and al through publicly available contributions therefore, we are developing a comprehensive plan for ksas contributions in global/local data and al global initiatives and events in fact; we are planning to host the first global al summit in ksa the summit will be a unique annual platform for global thought leaders, decision-makers and innovators to showcase, debate and shape the future agenda of al for governments, private sector and noos, to amplify al's positive value for humanity: objective  transform ksa's workforce with a steady local supply of data and al empowered talents data and al are transforming labor markets globally: most sectors will have to adapt in order to maximize the benefits this transformation is bringing: the faster we are in integrating data and al into our education system, professional trainings and into general public knowledge, the greater advantage we will gain in terms of employment; productivity and innovation: as for most countries undergoing the data and al transition, the kingdom, with its ambitious plan to develop its data and al sector; will face a skills shortage. most governments and private sector companies globally are competing to attract data scientists, data architects, coders and many of the professions needed to build data and al capabilities. the same actors are making efforts to attract talent from overseas but they also invest in the development of their own workforce: while this strategy aims at attracting foreign talent; it is crucial for the country to sustainably develop local talent and to provide the necessary incentives fof them to stay in saudi arabia: developing local talent requires to concentrater on three categories of the workforce natiohal strategy for data and ai  key



. data al experts specialists committed to innovation activities data and al specialists graduates from the field and who can potentially support its development general workforce labor force not necessarily working on data al topics but whose literacy in the field needs to be strengthened for the three categories, there should be an adapted effort in order to build the local workforce. within the framework of this strategy, we aim at creating educational tracks in data and al in k- and university degrees, some of which leading to specialist tracks supported by educational scholarships and professional training: we are also strengthening our cooperation with academic institutions while developing a certification program to recognize the efforts of professionals interested in developing data and ai skills objective  enact the most welcoming legislation for data and al businesses and talents our goal is to develop welcoming; flexible, and stable regulatory frameworks and incentives schemes to attract companies, investors and talents. regulations will also focus on developing adaptive policy frameworks and standards on data and al including the ethical use of al. these policies will provide direction to stakeholders and certainty over data and al activities. as part of providing an attractive regulatory framework for data and al investments and businesses, we aim at having strong framework to promote and support ethical development of data and al research and solutions this framework will provide guidelines for the development of our data protection and privacy standards. this is beneficial to both society as well as businesses and investors who need a stable regulatory framework to operate in the kingdom: national strategy for data and ai  key



. in addition, the creation of and access to open data is a crucial asset which any strong data and al ecosystem will need. opening government data provides significant opportunities to public and private sector organizations as well as individuals it would contribute to creating an attractive environment for startups, provide visibility on policy formation; decision-making and drive economic growth and innovation therefore, our ambition is to roll-out open data by default the implication being that all government data should be published as long as it does not compromise security, data protection, and privacy: however; this initiative requires a strong regulatory framework to provide high standards in terms of data protection and privacy, in line with our ethical approach to developing our data sector: doing this would define the framework through which government and private organizations will be able to benefit from the opportunities provided by data: the regulatory framework will include specifications on data collection, classification, sharing, open data policy and freedom of information: in order to achieve this, we will collaborate across government to ensure data is captured in readable formats, then start publishing the most timely and comprehensive datasets, to ultimately roll-out open data by default across government entities after . this illustrates our effort to facilitate access to public data for organizations contributing to the development of the sector this process starts with data collection where a standardized format will be required to capture data, followed by the publication of initial datasets from selected government organizations (ministries, agencies, or other), to test adoption from interested organizations this two-step initial phase would take place over the - period before transitioning to scaling our open data by default program across the whole-of-government from  onwards national strategy rata1ax



.   initiate adopt scale and excel launch government - publish additional roll-out open data wide open data data sets from by default across policy and ensure that select ministries government data is captured in a with the most timely readable form and comprehensive data sets in collaboration with ndmo and sector regulators - + enable entities to mature, create data open critical mass and enforce regulations by default ongoing efforts are made under vision  to promote doing business in the kingdom: our objective as part of this strategy is to ensure private sector development ambitions also benefit data and al. therefore, we will build an incentive package aimed at attracting foreign companies and facilitating the creation of local businesses in the data and al sector: this would encourage foreign firms to invest in the kingdom and facilitate knowledge transfer to empower local firms:



. objective  attract efficient, stable funding for qualified data and al investment opportunities our goal is to incentivize and enable local and foreign investors to effectively identify and fund available data and al investment opportunities in ksa we will build targeted funds and investor support programs to attract and guide domestic and foreign investments in data and al: the data and al sector in ksa will need large amounts of investments to grow: these investments can be encouraged by a fund that adds incentives by reducing the risk of subsidizing returns therefore, we will setup a fund/financial mechanism incentivizing foreign direct investment local investments in data and al priority areas_ we will invest in relevant cutting-edge data and al applications to the ksa market and new promising technologies to first-mover advantage. we will also setup an investors' support program providing professional services such as investment screening and business plan development: the ace of technological innovation in the data and al sector generates a continuous need to adapt our support would provide guidance to both foreign and domestic investors on the saudi ecosystem in terms of domestic financial facilities, the regulatory framework as well as the business ecosystem (high potential startups, projects, and planned initiatives): national strategy fok data ai  gain key



. objective  empower top data and al institutions to spearhead innovation and impact creation fostering an environment conducive to innovation is a critical element for data and al exploration. our goal is to elevate the quantity and quality of data and al rel capabilities including researchers, equipment; topics, commercialization vehicles, while expanding the capacity in new areas in data and al: ksa has and unique offering for innovation, as it is currently developing multiple giga-projects where technology is a central high-priority: the proliferation of these new and smart cities will constitute the best environment for new and creative use of data and ai. these cities will become test-beds to innovative use of al across multiple domains such as policies and regulations, and algorithms and applications development: we will aim to develop specialized clusters and hubs focused on providing a collaborative and forward thinking environment for researchers to come and explore the latest data and al possibilities as a result; innovation and research are expected to be centered not only around technological development but also in terms of data and al policies and regulations, developing ethical frameworks and the integration of al-enabled solutions into megacities' design: we will also focus on expanding current data and al randi capabilities. as a result, we aim at increasing the number of high quality rel papers to capture the most promising initiatives and contribute to the advancement of the sector globally: this will require close cooperation with both international and domestic academic institutions: national strategy for data and al 



. objective  stimulate data and al adoption with the most collaborative, and forward-thinking ecosystem one of the key success factors for data and al strategies will be attributed to the adoption of innovative solutions enabled by data and al, across the public and private sectors, as well as individuals developing a robust digital infrastructure that developers could utilize would be of utmost importance. in addition, public awareness of ongoing activities will be key to ensuring citizen understanding of the benefits generated by the fast emergence of a high number of data and al practical applications we will also develop sector-specific data and al plans. these sectors will be identified based on the current digital maturity of each sector; alignment with vision  objectives and data and al expected impact: in fact; while all sectors will be disrupted to a certain extent, some sectors will expect major shifts due to data and al: in order to promote nation-wide al adoption and utilization, it is crucial to provide the opportunity for individuals and small businesses to access well-established and sophisticated data and al platforms. we will develop sector-focused partnerships in the domain of data and al platforms and provide accessible data and al platforms at country level through partnerships with major companies with efficient and sophisticated platforms. promoting close cooperation within the ecosystem to include all key stakeholders such as the government; businesses, academic institutions, financial actors and the general public to develop linkages which are essential to achieve scale. national strategy for data ala

ethical ai framework overview . introduction to ai and data ethics in the age of big data, enormous quantities of data are being generated, collected and analysed to identify insights and support decisions making: big data are often described in terms of the five vs where: volume refers to the vast quantity of the data available; velocity refers to the at which data must be stored and/or analysed to provide the right information at the right time to make appropriate management decisions; variety refers to a huge variation in types and sources of data including both structure and unstructured data (e.g: file objects, social media feeds, tags, data from sensors, audio, image and video); veracity refers to the trustworthiness of the data over its accuracy and quality; and value refers to the ability to transform data to improve outcomes/values. analytical techniques that are used to analyse big data are often being described as advanced analytics, machine learning and ai. these technical terms have similar meanings and overlap with each other: they all refer to analytic operations that take advantage of volume data describing the past   situations  (i.e. historical data), and massive  processing   capabilities   and advanced algorithms, and that use them to find correlations and make predictions with acceptable accuracy: in a broad definition, al is a collective term for computer systems that can sense their environment, think, learn and take actions in response to the gathered data, with the ultimate of fulfilling their objectives. al systems are a collection of interrelated technologies used to help solve problems autonomously and perform tasks to achieve defined objectives without explicit guidance from a human being: we can distinguish the four main categories of ai (see figure ):  www ibm com/blogs/watson-health/the-s-vs-of-big-data/ - speed large - goal design

ethical ai framework overview the ethical ai framework consists of the following components: the tailored ai framework, which consists of the following sub-components: the ethical ai principles   define principles to be    followed when  designing and developing al applications. the ethical ai principles are applicable to all roles as defined in the ai governance structure; the ai governance structure defines standard structures and roles and responsibilities over the adoption process of al against practices set out in the ethical ai framework; the ai lifecycle defines an ai lifecycle model that is used to structure the layout of practices in the ai practice guide and the questions in the ai assessment; and the ai practice guide defines a set of practices for all stages in the al lifecycle the guiding practices are derived from the ethical al principles. the ai assessment consists of the ai application impact assessment template which defines questions to be answered by target readers across the stages as of the ai lifecycle to assess the impact of al applications and to ensure that ethical al principles have been considered. target  readers of the ethical ai framework  include it planners, system analysts,  system architects and data scientists. data scientists   encompass a role   including   development; deployment and monitoring al for the ethical al framework these areas can also be separate roles depending on the individual setup of the organisations. these target readers should leverage the ethical ai framework to: understand ethical ai principles and practices; initiate discussions on the impact of ai; adopt standardised of practices and terminology; and perform ai assessment for it planners and executives project strategy it planners and executives can refer to section ..

ethical ai framework overview principle definition sustainability and just the ai development should ensure that mitigation strategies are transition in place to manage any potential societal and environmental system impacts  table : ethical al principles and definitions ... transparency and interpretability principle: organisations  should be able to explain decision-making processes of the ai applications to humans in a clear and comprehensible manner: interpretability is the notion of creating human-understandable explanations of an al model'$ characteristics (e.g. features and parameters), as well as the decision-making pathways for each individual prediction. such interpretations may be of interest to various stakeholders of ai. related areas include understanding ai, ensuring models are explainable, transparency of processes, reproducibility and trust. across both global and local literature, it is recognised there is a need to be able to explain what ai actually does in a clear way. to create robust and trusted ai applications, an understanding of inner functioning of their models, as well as the data used at training and decision-making times is imperative. organisations should be interested in understanding the inner workings of al models to evaluate   and   establish trust in  utilising ai-driven solutions and make more confident decisions; data scientists may consult interpretation reports to decide whether a model should be deployed, or to facilitate better communication and collaboration with their peers, system analysts, system architects and managers; and governance bodies may require comprehensive and immutable interpretation reports ofan al model for auditing purposes. whatever the case may be, this necessitates an ethical principle that obliges ai developers to consider building interpretability capabilities into al applications. interpretability methods can be used to   generate   textual or visual   explanations of  models from two different perspectives, depending on the use case and stakeholders. please refer to section ...

ethical ai framework overview explainability explainability refers to the degree to which a decision made by an ai application can be understood by a human expert. depending on whether the data, algorithms and configurations of an ai model are available at the time of interpretation, two approaches can be taken to generate human-readable explanations: built-in interpretation: some models inherently have the ability to explain their behaviour. for example, decision trees are essentially a cascade of questions and work comparably to the way humans think. when executing against a data (using its features and values)_ the pathways to reach a decision can be simply reported back to human users. similarly, linear models like logistic regression are fairly intuitive and easy to explain to a non- expert in data science, as the data points can be visualised in a plot against the learned probability line, and feature importance metrics can be calculated, and absolute values reported back to data scientists post-hoc interpretation: post-hoc   interpretation of an ai model is an effort beyond exploratory data analysis  techniques to understand its behaviour after it has  finished training, o when the model is in production and only accessible through an application programming interface (~apt ). while post-hoc interpretation is less likely to elucidate the exact inner workings of a model, it can help end-users to approximate the behaviour of the model by way of examples, surrogate models or visualisation of feature importance and partial dependence plots. depending on which stakeholder is on the receiving end of the interpretation, natural language explanations of a model's behaviour can be generated using techniques from the natural language generation ( nlg"") domain to create. note, there is an  inherent  trade-off between  explainability and accuracy of machine learning algorithms. nonparametric machine learning algorithms o models with a very large number of parameters (e.g. deep neural networks or ensemble models) can learn complex, latent   patterns from large-scale data and offer   flexibility and   superior performance, at the cost of being *opaque"" in nature. in contrast; parametric models, such as naive bayesian or simple neural networks, that can be trained with a set of fixed parameters are easier to explain but often are less performant though this is not always the case. in addition to the type, size and complexity of training data that usually dictate the learning models, the safety-critical nature of the ai application and desired level of explanation should be considered at design time. transparency transparency is notably the most critical characteristic of building trust into al models. trust is dynamic, developed and strengthened in a gradual manner: it is realised through carefully designing a process to minimise risk, and therefore, plays a crucial role in the widespread adoption of new, disruptive technologies like ai. trust is hard to come by and builds upon several   factors including purpose and performance of the ai applications, as well as the technology provider (e.g organisation's brand reputation, level of transparency in operations, reliability and being able to explain the rationale behind the al models decisions are crucial  for building and maintaining trusts the transparency principle calls  for the - point design;



ethical ai framework overview adoption of a clear; honest communication channel between an organisation and its end-users and regulators, when needed, and its indispensable nature. the stochastic nature of ai applications makes them fundamentally different from conventional software development paradigms in what follows, we iterate possible ways of embedding transparency into the design of al applications based on institute of electrical and electronics engineers ( ieee"") standards: transparency as traceability: the transparency of the software engineering process during implementation that should   allow technical   inspection of which norms have been implemented, explicitly and implicitly, for which contexts, and how possible conflicts are resolved. transparency as verifiability: this concerns how normative reasoning is approached in the implementation and how it is possible to verify that the normative decisions the system makes match the   required norms and values using possibly explicit and exact representations with the objective to provide the basis for a range of strong mathematical techniques, such as formal verification: verifiability is also important in case of failure, in the sense that if an ai application causes harm, it should be possible to ascertain why, in case of judicial decision-making involving an ai model, it must be possible to provide satisfactory explanation auditable by a competent human authoritys. transparency as non-deception and honest design: stakeholder of the global ai community has a strong and shared interest in avoiding al applications autonomously creating any information or content in any form (text; audio, video) that intentionally represent states of the world that do not correspond partially or entirely to specific states of fact with the intent of deceiving any third-party (human or machines). of course, in certain use cases   of ai application   deception may be necessary in  serving the core functionality of the system (e.g. in case of gaming, entertainment and art applications), but those actions are no longer norm violations because are justified by context and user consent?. transparency as personal privacy: people should have the right to access, manage and control the data generate and that can be used by ai applications common misconception regarding transparency is a belief that organisations must reveal their a-related intellectual property (e.g. source code, models' configurations, comprehensive views of their data sets  to provide for a ""transparent al . on the contrary, the transparency principle  calls   for the   adoption of a clear; honest   communication channel   between an organisation and its end-users and regulators, when needed, and its indispensable nature. otherwise, the for-profit"" nature of many al applications, as well as third-party al vendors` business models would never allow organisations to adhere to this principle. in fact; having a very detailed transparency level with end-users of an ai application would possibly make it susceptible to being gamed"" by malicious users. at the same time, auditors and regulators may require accurate, exhaustive views into the organisation's al-driven processes. in such cases, the level of transparency may be decided by the organisation as seen fit:  istandards iece org/content/dam/iccc-standards/standards/web/documents/other/ead_v2 pdf  //standards iecc org/content/dam/icce-standards/standards/web/documents/other/ead_v2 pdf - and any beings they they



ethical ai framework overview provability provability refers to the mathematical certainty behind al models' decisions. it mandates a higher level of formalism in   explaining an ai   application' $ behaviour. this   type of interpretability is geared more towards data scientists to place an al model under scrutiny to ensure the decision-making policies of the model can be mathematically proved and remain consistent as changes in data and environment take place. equitably, in many safety-critical ai applications, where the use of al must be approved or certified by regulators, provability becomes indispensable. examples_(please refer_to_section  al practice guide ' for further_examples and practices) project team should aim to embed elements of transparency into the al applications and translate them into human language decision treelillustration to explain to users how decisions are made) this allows human to understand whether the decision made by ai has errors and fix the errors_ provide examples to explain the al decision-making process in narrative terms or graphics (for example, drawing a workflow with decision trees) whenever possible for a non-technical audience to understand and visualise the al operations better: organisations should make explicit how different factors and data determine the outcomes and conclusions of their ai models ... reliability, robustness and security principle: like other it applications, al applications should be developed such that will operate reliably over periods of time using the right models and datasets while ensuring are both robust (i.e. providing consistent results and capable to handle errors) and remain secure against cyber-attacks as required by the relevant legal and industry frameworks. the overarching aim of the reliability, robustness and security principle is to ensure that al applications behave as intended, from training data to final output, over prolonged periods of time. reliability is about increasing the likelihood of the system being fault-free. robustness is to ensure that models perform when assumptions and variables change. security is to protect the data and model itself: across both global and local literature, it is recognised there is a need to ensure al applications behave as intended. areas in the literature include awareness of misuse, integrity, robustness, resilience, effectiveness, quality, appropriateness, accuracy and security. in particular, there is a focus on preventing harm: it is an indispensable requirement for al applications to be designed and developed in a way that takes into consideration that environment; data and processes o which rely, change over time. malevolent actors of ai applications can exploit such drifts in the al operating - (e.g: using they long they they



ethical ai framework overview environment with a variety of techniques to penetrate and fool al models to make incorrect predictions with high confidence: the adoption of the reliability, robustness and security principle assists organisations to identify potential weaknesses in an al application, improve overall performance, withstand adversarial attacks, and monitor long term performance of ai models throughout their operational lifetime, and verifiably so where applicable and feasible. reliability fundamental to creating reliable software applications, reliability is an engineering effort to maximise the probability that a system will perform its required functions fault-free within a specified time period and the environments as the complexity of al algorithms and systems built upon them increases, the role of disciplined software engineering practices, such as standards and software tests, become more prominent to ensure two measures encompassed in reliability: availability: the degree to which a system o component is operational and accessible when required, often expressed as a probability'. in safety-critical o real-time missions, the availability of al applications is of high significance and the absence thereof can lead to potentially fatal consequences. serviceability: sometimes also referred to as maintainability, is the degree of ease with which a system can be maintained o repaired. changes to the infrastructure where ai systems are running , the requirements that al models have to fulfil, as well as issues and bugs that surface over time, require the al developers to periodically correct defects, analyse their root causes and prevent future failures. while quality and integrity are applicable to individuals adhering to industry best practices and organisational codes of conduct; it is also important that organisations closely monitor and manage the quality and integrity of the data being used to develop al applications data quality' determines the reliability of the information to serve an  intended purpose and attributes that define the usability of information, whereas data integrity refers to the reliability ofinformation in terms of its physical and logical validity - based on accuracy and consistency of the data across its lifecycle the absence of unintended change to the information between successive   updates. the considerations relating to data   quality and   integrity are consistency, accuracy, validity, timeliness, uniqueness and completeness. robustness robustness is a characteristic describing a model's ability to effectively perform while its variables or assumptions are altered: in order to ensure a model is robust; validations and error handling must be incorporated at every step of the data science pipeline, from data preparation and ingestion through to prediction: robust models must perform consistently while being exposed to a new and independent (but http i www mitjyu filope/kurssitties462 /materiaalit/ieee_softwarcengglossary pdf http i www mitjyu filope/kurssitties462 /materiaalit/ieee_softwarcengglossary pdf - key



ethical ai framework overview similar) datasets and be able to deal with the errors and corner cases that occur at execution time. robustness also entails placing effective error handling measures in place to protect al models when exposed to malicious inputs and parameters. security many of existing security practices conventional to software development efforts are also applicable for ai and machine learning models. as largely rely on data curated and integrated with public or third-party sources, they must be able to discern between malicious input and benign anomalous data. when designing security protocols extra care should be taken to cleanse, secure and encrypt data, as well as designing access controls to the trained model. adversarial attacks, the act of introducing small, intentional perturbations to data used to compel ai models to make incorrect predictions with high confidence, is one of such security risks. additionally, for organisations that do not provide direct access to their al models, but expose them as web services, designing security protocols that prevent attackers from reverse engineering their model is necessary: examples (please refer to section  ai practice guide ' for further examples and practices_ ai systems should be technically robust, and should be protected from any malicious use. malicious actors can try to deceive al models with inputs designed to learn about the ai and deceive it: controls are necessary to ensure that the al application will not be exposed to potential hackers who will train the al model to perform tasks it was not intended to perform: when such cases happen, this will lead to liability and reputational risk to the organisation using the al application: continuous monitoring which includes validation;, verification of accuracy and maintenance of the model should be performed regularly to improve the security and robustness of ai. this is because hackers usually look for outdated software with security flaws which are more vulnerable to cyberattacks. constantly   updating the ai application, this will minimise such security risks. ... fairness principle:   the recommendation/result  from the ai applications should treat individuals within similar groups in a fair manner, without favouritism or discrimination and without causing o resulting in harm: this entails maintaining respect for the individuals behind the data and refraining from using datasets that contain discriminatory biases. with regards to fairness, article  of the universal declaration of human rights states that everyone is entitled t0 all the rights and freedoms set forth in this declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex; language, religion, political or other opinions, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. furthermore, no distinction - they i,e.- they by



ethical ai framework overview shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty"" it is therefore important for al applications to limit discrimination or bias relative to the factors reported in the article. the same principle against discrimination is included in the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women: the following is a list of key legal terminology for consideration when understanding fairness  and how it applies to organisations o al applications implementation: prejudice: prejudice means to injure or harm a person'$ rights. discrimination:  discrimination means the   adverse, unfair or detrimental treatment; preference, exclusion o distinction of a person because of the person '$ race, colour, sex, sexual orientation, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family or   carer' $ responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction o social origin: impartiality: impartiality means to act or make a decision based 0n merit and according to the law without bias, influence, preconception or unreasonableness. positive discrimination: positive discrimination means the: treatment of a person; taking of an action affecting a person; and/or making of a decision affecting a person because of that person s race, colour; sex; sexual orientation, age, physical o mental disability, marital status, family or carer'$ responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or  social origin that is done with the intention of achieving: substantive equality; equal enjoyment; equal exercise of human rights; and/or equal exercise of fundamental freedoms for that person. it is   paramount to   acknowledge that fairess is a social construct. there are many mathematical definitions of fairness, and when we choose one, we violate some aspects of the others. in other words, it is impossible for every decision to be truly fair to all parties. no ai application can be universally fair or unbiased""i . however, al applications can be designed to meet specific fairness goals, thus mitigating some of the perceived unfairness and creating a more responsible system overall. examples_(please refer to_section  al practice guide ' for further_examples and practices) training data should be free from any bias characteristics such as sample size disparity (where there is significantly less data for minority groups), selection bias (where certain groups are less likely to be selected); bias in model design and bias in model use and feedback (e.g: by checking for stereotyping certain groups when relying on data and  please note that often there is no universal legal meaning for these words/phrases and that particular definitions can differ based on their purpose and the circumstances of that situation. therefore, in this context the definitions are purposefully broad and relatively simple; taking into account the context in which are t0 be used (i.e_ broad-based decision-making framework)  www strategy-business com/article what-is-fair-when-it-comes-to-al-bias?gko_-82zc0 http |www jennwv com/papers/checklists_pdf - they



ethical ai framework overview algorithms) if the ai application is biased, the decisions made will show preference towards certain groups of individuals. ensure integrity of source data   obtained to help ensure a fair outcome from the ai application data which are invalid or inaccurate, when used to train an ai model, will lead to biased decisions and affected users will be discriminated unintentionally due to the flaw in datasets. ... diversity and inclusion principle: inclusion and diverse usership through the ai application should be promoted by understanding and respecting the interests of all stakeholders impacted. this principle works under the assumption that local cultural norms do not contradict either any general o performance principles. al can be used globally by a great variety of people their interpretation of the an ai application behaves can consequently differ: to achieve diversity and inclusion, it is important to involve the largest possible number of al users representing the broadest variety of cultures, interests, lifestyles and disciplines. examples (please refer to section  ai practice guide ""' for further examples and practices): ai application developers should always consider people of different backgrounds, races and gender. if such differences were not considered, the ai application might behave differently   towards certain groups of  individuals  causing  inconvenience. one such example is alrecruiting tool showing preference towards caucasians because the tool was developed by caucasians. ... human oversight principle: the degree of human intervention required as part of al application's decision- making or operations should be dictated by the level of the perceived severity of ethical issues. human oversight is the capability ofhumans in making choices that is to think and determine an outcome and consequently enact upon it. ai applications are regarded as autonomous systems to various degrees and as become prevalent in our lives, their function in real- world contexts is often correlated with fear and uncertainty. examples_(please refer to_section  al practice guide"" for further examples and practices) ensure an appropriate level of human intervention based on multiple factors such as the benefits and risks of the al application; impacts of the al decision, operational cost and - way they



ethical ai framework overview evolving societal norms and values. having some level of human intervention will also reduce job displacement risk: controls should be implemented that allow for human intervention o auto-shutdown in the event of system failure especially when the system failure will have an impact on human safety. one such example is autonomous vehicle where human should be given the to prevent the vehicle from causing accidents if it failed to detect human on the road. ... lawfulness and compliance principle: organisations responsible for an al application should always act in accordance with the law and regulations and relevant regulatory regimes. in all cases, the principles that al applications must adhere to are contained in international treaties or regulations as well as in national legislations and industry standards. it is therefore indispensable for any organisation dealing with the development 0r implementation of ai applications to master and apply consistently all relevant obligations emanated by legislative sources at any level. examples_(please refer_to_section 4_ al practice guide ' for further_examples and practices) ai system developed must be in compliance with regulations and laws ifthere are no laws to the use of ai, humans with bad intentions will develop al applications that will cause harm. compliance review processes for al applications should be defined to keep track of regulatory changes and to ensure that the policies and processes are compliant. ... data privacy principle: individuals should have the right to: a be informed ofthe purpose of collection and potential transferees of their personal data and that personal data shall only be collected for a lawful purpose, by using lawful and fair means, and that the amount of personal data collected should not be excessive in relation to the purpose. please refer to the data protection principles (dpp"")l ""purpose and manner of collection"" of the personal data (privacy) ordinance (the ""pd(p)o ) b be assured that data users take all practicable steps to ensure that personal data are accurate and is not kept longer than is necessary. please refer to the dppz accuracy and duration of retention"" of the pd(p)o. require that personal data shall only be used for the original purpose of collection and any directly related purposes. otherwise, express and voluntary consent of the individuals is required. please refer to the dpp3 ""use of personal data' of the pd(p)o: - option govern

ethical ai framework overview could arise in which al applications attempt to take control over their own reward systems or where the learning system fails with unpredictable consequences. it is also necessary to determine who is responsible for what and to this regard it is possible to say that designers and builders of advanced ai applications are stakeholders in the moral implications of their use, misuse, and actions, with a responsibility and opportunity to shape those implications examples_(please refer_to_section 4_ al practice guide ' for further_examples and practices) where al tools are used to augment human in decision-making, they should be safe, trustworthy, and aligned with the ethics and preferences of people who are influenced by their actions. if robots are deployed to provide care for the elderly, the robot should not cause physical o mental harm to the elderly. ... accountability principle: organisations are responsible for the moral implications of their use and misuse of ai applications. there   should also be a clearly identifiable   accountable party, be it an individual or an organisational entity (e:g: the al solution provider) accountability ensures the responsibilities and liability of stakeholders are made clear and that people can be held accountable. this includes ensuring that responsibilities are fulfilled from planning through to record-keeping: accountability is a fundamental mentioned in literature both locally and globally. it is a cornerstone   principle  in most   privacy  frameworks and/or legislation: it is  necessary to determine who is responsible for what, and in this regard, it is possible to say that designers and builders of advanced ai systems are stakeholders in the moral implications of their use, misuse and actions, with a responsibility and opportunity to shape those implications accountability is into action through a comprehensive, end-to-end governance process. governance   typically  refers  to the   collective set  of policies, procedures   and  oversight internally and externally that manages the risk of systems and meets required obligations. this will help management of ethical responsibilities and assist to track and mitigate risks related to big data and al projects. by introducing an appropriate governance framework, this can balance the need for innovation within the organisation and the need to safeguard the public interest. examples (please refer to section  ai practice guide ""' for further examples and practices) people and organisations responsible for the creation and implementation of alalgorithms should be identifiable and accountable for the impacts ofthat algorithm, even if the impacts are unintended. when ai causes damage and there is no responsible party, the end user affected will not be compensated fairly. - being put



ethical ai framework overview ... beneficial ai principle: the development of ai should promote the common good. ai applications should not cause harm to humanity and should instead positively promote the common and wellbeing: technologies can be created with the best intentions, but without considering well-being metrics, can still have dramatic negative consequences o people'$ mental health, emotions, sense of themselves, their autonomy, their ability to achieve their and other dimensions of well-being; ai applications can be ethical, legal, profitable and safe in their usage and yet not positively contribute to human   well-being   wellbeing metrics that include   psychological, social, economic   fairness,  and environmental factors could enable a better   evaluation of the technological progress benefits while able to test for unintended negative consequences of al to impact and diminish human well-being: examples_(please refer to_section  al practice guide""' for further_examples and practices_ development of al should promote the progress of society and human civilisation, create smarter working methods and lifestyles, and enhance people's livelihood and welfare. if the ai application does not show any benefits to the human civilisation, people may opt out of using ai application because it does not benefit them. ai that does not promote common may hurt and destroy the well-being ofthe society: one such example includes the autonomous weapon which will cause great danger to human race ... cooperation and openness principle: a culture of multi-stakeholder open cooperation in the ai ecosystem should be fostered. cooperation and openness are about   building trust. it   includes different stakeholder collaborating and communicating with end-users and other impacted groups on risks and plans to handle these risks this principle is emphasised for educating the public about al to help build trust'. the endeavour  of developing or implementing ai applications   should be an open and collaborative process involving a diverse internal team and engagement with diverse end-user groups within the community. in this regard, organisations should proactively collaborate with   / www pwc ch/en/publications/]zpwc_responsible_artificial_intelligence_2017_en pdf - good goals being good



ethical ai framework overview any type of stakeholders, ranging from end-user to universities, research centres, governments and professional associations in order to help to mitigate the risk of exclusion and inherent biases within the ai application: examples (please refer to section  ai practice guidel for further examples and practices): organisations should actively seek to develop and enhance al application cross domain, cross sector and cross organisation. if there is no cooperation between different teams, the ai model may make biased decisions due to lack of diverse opinions/user testing: project managers can work together with the project team as well as end-users to perform testing before deployment. ... sustainability and just transition principle: the ai development should ensure that mitigation strategies are in place to manage any potential societal and environmental system impacts. ai can help transform traditional sectors and systems to societal and environmental challenges as well as bolster human well-being: although ai presents transformative opportunities to address some of the societal and environmental challenges, left unguided, it also has the capability to accelerate the society and environment's degradation the deployment of ai applications potentially carries profound societal and environmental impacts as in the case of worker displacement or in the areas of caring for the elderly, sick and disabled (e.g. can ai robots replace humans and how does this impact people being cared for), education and planet preservation: to develop a sustainable ai, the ultimate is to ensure that it becomes values- aligned with humanity, promising safe application of technology for humankind. in practice, this means checks and balances developed to ensure that evolving ai applications remain sustainable. this means that there is a need to guarantee that ai applications (with possible societal and environmental impacts= are implemented with an appropriate mitigation plan: examples (please refer to section  ai practice guide ""' for further examples and practices) ai system can be used to contribute to lesser carbon footprint: ai technology can be used to optimise power utilisation at data centres and help save energy. ai technology infrastructure should be scalable to sustain for long-term enhancements. if the ai applications were developed on infrastructure that could not be scaled-up, this may lead to limitations in the future for fine-tuning of model. - goal

ethical ai framework overview in a typical development process of an al application, great emphasis is placed on data because data are often required for creating a ai model. data sourcing and preparation which is of the project development can be a continuous exercise. this is because an ai model can often benefit from better or more data for iterative model training throughout the development process. the approach of conventional software lifecycle is to program the it application with a set of instructions for a pre-defined set of events. thereafter; the it application will exploit its computing capabilities and other resources to process the data fed into the system: this is different from an ai application where a huge amount of data are fed into the application, which in turn processes all the data resulting in a trained model o al solution: this trained model is then used to solve new problems. there is often a continual feedback loop between the development and deployment stages, as well as system operation and monitoring of the ai lifecycle for iterative improvements making this distinct from a traditional software development lifecycle. - good good part

ethical ai framework ai practice guide .... model overfitting definition: overfitting is a modelling error that emerges when an al model is trained to closely fit a limited set of data points. an overfitting model will often exhibit high accuracy on the training dataset but low accuracy on new data. if the al model does not generalise well from the training data to new or unseen data, the ai model may perform poorly in its prediction. who are involved at this stage? data scientists practices and examples: practice practice detail perform cross - cross-validation is a resampling  procedure that would be validation performed by a development team to evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy ofan al model based on a limited data sample. one example of a resampling procedure is the k-fold technique. the k-fold technique allows training and testing of the amodel k-times on different subsets of training data to derive a more accurate estimate of the model s prediction performance every resampled dataset should have a similar distribution as the full population's distribution for this approach to be acceptable. for example, if the full population consists   of  distinct categories,  the resampled dataset   should have a comparable number of distinct categories this is because missing categories during the cross-validation process can lead to bias in the ai model's outcome. perform consider the use of regularisation. regularisation is the process regularisation and to normalise and bring uniformity to al models regularisation other forms of model is often a technique used in machine learning to fine-tune the al selection model  function by discouraging the learning of additional and unnecessary   complex models. this can reduce the risk of overfitting: an example of a regularisation technique is pruning: this can be used to remove features that are the least important for the model to learn from. ai models can learn not oly basic features of provided datasets but also noise as well as fluctuations that place importance on unimportant features and hence pruning can help. examples of unimportant features can include backgrounds in an image containing the actual object being detected. -



ethical ai framework ai practice guide practice practice detail example: to avoid overfitting in the case of medical diagnosis, cross-validation can be performed. ai models can be further evaluated by splitting sample data by specific medical conditions and re-evaluating the model's diagnosis another method to avoid overfitting is reducing factors unrelated to the condition (e.g: social background or location in some cases to reduce the complexity of the ai model). such practices would assist organisations to adhere to the ~reliability, robustness and security"" principle. related ethical ai principles: . reliability, robustness and security overfitting should be avoided to ensure outcomes from ai models when used on unseen data are reliable and accurate. .... model training ownership definition: al models where the training process is partially or fully outsourced to the public cloud or relies on third-party pre-trained models can introduce new security risks. please note that if the al model training process is not outsourced, the practices and examples in this subsection are not applicable. who are involved at this stage? sourcing team (i.e. procurement). -



ethical ai framework ai practice guide practices and examples: practice practice detail use trusted the process of training an ai model involves providing the ai cloud/third-party model with training data to learn from. precise training data are services required to help ai models to understand patterns to derive conclusion: third-party vendor used to train an al model or to provide a cloud training environment for the organisation should be subject to the third-party procurement process. this helps lower the risk of receiving tampered model that may feature a backdoor. please refer to section ... ~procuring ai services  for details on third-party procurement process. organisations should assess the suitability of storing and using personal data o data belonging to organisations on the public cloud. the trained model should be transferred only through channels that   provide   surety of integrity in transit:   examples   include docker containers and pickle files (for python scripts) which can then be encrypted before being transferred. example: when using cloud/third-party services, validate that cloud vendor is compliant with international security standards such as iso and organisational security practices compliance with international standards can help to ensure that ethical ai principles such as ""data privacy and *reliability, robustness and security"" are followed: related ethical ai principles: . reliability, robustness and security third-party' $ compliance with relevant international standards increases the likelihood that their al applications remain reliable, robust and secure. .... adversarial attacks definition an adversarial attack takes place when malicious actors deceive the al models to intentionally influence the ai application s outputs without detected: this is attempted by modifying the input data to induce the al model to make an incorrect prediction. such attacks can occur in the training phase o the test phase. attacks that appear during the training phase are known as poisoning attacks whereas attacks that exist in the test phase can be identified as evasion attacks who are involved at this stage? data scientists, project managers - any being



ethical ai framework ai practice guide practices and examples: practice practice detail perform adversarial the project team should obtain as many adversarial examples training as possible and explicitly train the model not to be misled by these samples. adversarial   training involves   enlarging the dataset to   include adversarial examples from which the ai models   can learn from. adversarial  training is introduced to secure the ai application from   disruptive  perturbations at different  points   of vulnerability in an ai model. disruptive perturbations happen  when a small random value is added to existing data points in training data that alter the original features of the data  such examples can often be seen in digital images where random  values are added to the original image which results in the wrong classification by the al model (e.g: an image ofapanda is classified as gibbon due to disruptive perturbations). build a new adversarial machine learning model that predicts whether a dataset is from a recent dataset or from the ai training dataset  this could be a method to identify new changing data, leading to new forms of adversarial attacks that would require retraining of the ai model: for example, there are open-source libraries written in python programming   language such as the adversarial robustness toolbox2 that can be used to train a models against adversarial attacks. perform dimension use dimensionality reduction on the training data to enhance the reduction resilience of a classifier as a defence mechanism against evasion attacks. this means there are fewer data dimensions that can be used to falsify data. dimensionality reduction refers to techniques that reduce the attributes of the data but still retain the meaningful  properties of the  original data. as an example, personal data attributes can include age, height; weight and race. checking the missing values ratio is a method to reduce the dimensionality in data. data fields with numerous empty o null values are less likely to carry useful information. therefore, data fields with the number of empty values greater than a certain threshold could be removed. the higher the threshold set; the more data reduction will be performed. example: adversarial training (.e. training model using adversarial examples to defense against adversarial attacks) is often required for adherence to the principle of ""reliability, robustness and security' to mitigate adversarial   attacks, someone may use standard  wwwibm combblogs /rescarch///ai-adversarial-robustness-toolbox  -

ethical ai framework ai assessment . ai assessment ai assessment suggested in this section provides a set of targeted questions (aligned to the ai lifecycle) to assist organisations to assess, identify, analyse and evaluate the benefits and impacts of al applications, to ensure are meeting the intent of ethical ai principles and to determine the appropriate mitigation measures required to control any negative impacts within an acceptable level: . ai application impact assessment the ai application impact assessment should be conducted on an ai application at different stages ofthe allifecycle the ai application impact assessment introduces a systematic thinking process for   organisations to go   through different aspects of considerations of  individual applications for their associated benefits and risks whilst highlighting the need for additional governance activities and identifying follow-up actions to ensure necessary measures and controls required for implementing ethical ai. the ai application impact assessment process includes the identification and analysis of: processes related to the ai application and ethical ai principles that align with the ai practice guide requirements; benefits that the ai application will bring; negative impacts on specific stakeholders; and establishment of required controls and compliance/monitoring processes the benefits of performing an ai application impact assessment are to enable better risk mitigation decisions that maximise benefits (through discussions on identified benefits, risks and impacts); provide a balanced view of existing al application risks; and increase the organisations ability to reassure stakeholders on how al application impact is managed. the ai application impact assessment template is used to both document and record how an ai application has met the requirements outlined in the ai practice guide internal requirements and to facilitate the review and approval process with the considerations made on the approval decision. the ai application impact assessment template is also used to evaluate the risk that an application poses and assist organisations to map and develop specific governance requirements to mitigate those risks. the ai application impact assessment template used for this assessment is in microsoft word format with sections for providing qualitative answers. please refer to appendix c *al application impact assessment template"" for details. the ai application impact assessment has the following components: - they

executive summary over six decades, the evolutionary development of al has been astonishing and proves its capability  through   simple neural networks, multi-level text   analytics, deep learning,  image analytics, self-adaptive and natural language processing breakthroughs, neuromorphic technology, and the edge of human consciousness   system development: al has been implemented and adopted in business sectors for a variety of purposes in manufacturing; health care, retail, banking, and public services the rapid development of al calls out key areas that need to be addressed in any future policy or law governing the use of al, such as privacy, accountability,  safety, and security; transparency and explainability; fairness and non- discrimination; human control of technology; professional responsibility; and promotion of human values. firms and organizations across all sectors strive to maximize the potential of their data to make better decisions for commercial and social purposes: from a technical perspective , there are several types of al applications, such as machine learning, deep learning, hybrid learning; and digital twins: some of the industries seen as benefiting from al in cambodia are healthcare, education, and finance. for healthcare, al can be used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnoses and identify potential health risks and preventative measures for example, al can analyze medical images and identify abnormalities such as tumors or other potential health issues. in addition; al can be used in education in cambodia to improve the quality and accessibility of education. another area where al is beginning to have an impact in cambodia is finance. al is being used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of financial transactions and identify potential fraud and money laundering: overall; the development and adoption of al in cambodia is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to transform many aspects of society. the key challenges and opportunities in this area include the need for specialized skills and expertise, as well as the need to address ethical and privacy concerns. with continued investment and development; al has the potential to greatly benefit cambodia in the coming years. strategically, randd is essential to cope with the al-enabled advancements in the world: with billions of dollars expected to be generated from al globally, cambodia sees the need and urgency to invest, adapt, and prepare for this al global force in line with the industry . trend as the economy increasingly becomes knowledge- and digital-based. there are many challenges and concerns that come with the use of al. certainly, machine learning requires massive amounts of data and computing time. researchers are generally challenged when it comes to finding high-quality, unbiased training sets to teach al. in many cases, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of records, are required to properly implement deep learning algorithms. and data sets containing biased information can lead to undesirable results. there are other cultural challenges to consider that branch out into new issues for leadership. vii



when it comes to incorporating al. also, there has been much written about how al will take jobs away from unskilled or easily automated workers: in cambodia, this technology is not just about al. it is about creating a digital framework within the existing infrastructure to implement its learning capability alongside the work of information and communication technology. relevant legal framework on data and cybersecurity is also needed to be in force to combat cybercrimes and provide assurance to relevant businesses, practitioners, and consumers in the field. infrastructure is the and there is already a basic technological foundation that cambodia has been building for years that will be leveraged to maximize the impact of al: last but not least, al is one of the essential technologies in the world that is game-changing in every   sector to improve   productivity,  efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. in order to foster trustworthy al ecosystems, it is essential for countries to develop human-centered policies that promote socio-economic and responsible al research and development. this includes policies that encourage investment in such initiatives. these policies for al development should take into account its national development vision as well as regional and global trends: the country's objectives, preferences, and overarching strategy for al advancement in the immediate and distant future should be clarified. initially, the main objective is to cultivate skilled personnel and employ al solutions to deal with critical national focus areas that will have a swift impact on cambodia's socio-economic status. over time, the priority should shift to developing fundamental and advanced research, promoting high-level al research and innovation; and establishing cambodia's standing in advanced technology on a global: viii key,

1_ the boundless potential of al: adoption and regulations .. trend-megatrends the fast-moving trend of artificial intelligence (al) has gained its impetus to fundamentally change the business and economy landscape and society for the last few years the term artificial intelligence (al) was first coined in  to broadly address the machine simulation of intelligence where the machine can simulate every aspect of learning and feature of intelligence (lau and haugh, ). over six decades, the evolutionary development of al is astonishing and proofs its capability from simple neural networks, multi-level text analytics, deep learning; image analytics, self-adaptive and natural language processing breakthrough, neuromorphic technology, and the edge of human consciousness system development: at this new stage of al commercialisation; the ecosystem of industries is   disrupted and expectedly   forcibly transformed into digital and technological capability at various layers (deloitte, ); firstly, the enterprise with maturity in al application and capable resources will use al in both management and production processes to foresee, with the use of data-mining, the global megatrend and the ability of their products and services to be commercialised. this enterprise change will cover sales, security, anti-fraud, human resource management; marketing, personal assistant; and smart tools: the second layer of industry change is expected to optimise the relationship between   upstream and downstream sectors on the traditional   industry chain where the consumer can access the product features directly. this industry change will take its course in finance, healthcare, education, retail, manufacturing, media, agriculture, and logistics, to name a lastly, the future labor structure of enterprises will be transformed with virtual and augmented realities, gesture recognition, and robots to increase productivity and competitiveness: the embrace of al among asean member states (ams) , of which % of asean is at the early stages, and % of asean is at advanced stages, is still at the nascent stages given the differences in the national priority, strategic investment, piloting initiatives within discrete activities, scaling initiatives, and end-to-end scaled implementation of al (chua and dobberstein, ). the potential of al contribution to the region's growth domestic product (gdp) is forecasted to be approximately uss trillion, accounted for about  to % of dgp uplift across ams in . nevertheless; the impact variance will be varied from one ams to another based on the country's maturity in terms of al infrastructure and adoption readiness; for instance, cambodia, at the early stage of al adoption, focuses more on the primary sectors (chua and dobberstein, )- the top five sectors which will benefit from al include () manufacturing; () retail and hospitality, () agriculture, () government, safetylsecurity, and smartcities, () healthcare. with industry . technologies; al could further advance the entire value chain, from product engineering and supply chain management to logistics and circular management: while having a dynamic and few:



mobile-centric population, the asean region will boost retail and hospitality with machine learning and big data advancement. for the agricultural sector; drone and image recognition technologies will contribute to the prevention of crop diseases, pesticide and fertiliser application, and post- harvest management: amid the complexity of challenges pertaining to the public sectors, al will play essential role in resources' optimisation, traffic   congestion relief; education; and healthcare such as the accessibility to healthcare service, tracking, and management of infectious diseases. al is no longer the futuristic term in cambodia as the al community is exponentially growing while al technologies have become a reality and used in various sectors. early al community is seen in  , i.e. an open-source algorithms community to develop al skills in cambodia, initiated by a regional start-up, wwwslash co. one such al application is the flood detection system, managed by people in need,; to potentially identify ""false positive"" alarms and predict flood risk among other projects: identity match, fraud detection, smart city, khmer chatbot;, ekyc[know your customer] system, and al for real estate business. another deployment of al is the demine robotics with the three key functions: () detect; () retrieve, and () destroy and the uniqueness of this robot is its small size, strength, intelligence , machine efficiency, machine sensitivity, and data collection: other al  prototypes include scara robot, 4dof robot manipulator; dual axis solar tracker; drone (hexacopter) , and mobile robot using omni wheel, at   intelligent mechatronics   laboratory, institute of   technology of cambodia: universities including the national institute of posts, telecommunications and ict with new name as cambodia academy of digital technology, the american university of phnom penh, kirirom institute of technology, and the institute of technology of cambodia offer courses in al, which will nurture the local talent. while constrained by the lockdown and health-safety measures, the early transformation of the soft and hard infrastructure of business could be seen across cambodia: the earliest is the dine-in restaurant; where the service is turned to only takeaway and delivery. the drive-through and curbside restaurant and stores become relianton the pre-order and delivery app. the school is closed, and the physical classroom becomes online. digital platforms and services viz foodpanda, nham24, bloc, cambodia aeon online, become overnight popular. as such; al integration will be potential for business in cambodia. .. need al adoption artificial intelligence has the capability to simulate intelligent, human-like behavior in computers, high speed with cutting-age technology, where the applications of al are enormous including finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, education, agriculture, transportation, law, etc. there are various forms of al, such as machine learning; expert systems, robotics, neural networks, fuzzy logic, and natural language processing: for instance, machine learning in which machines could encompass neural networks and deep learning; like our human brains, can observe, analyse, and  an



learn from facts and errors rather than being told what to believe: this technology has an impact on consumer items and has resulted in important discoveries in healthcare and physics, as well as changes in industries as diverse as manufacturing, banking, and retail. over time , machine learning algorithms increase their performance by learning from data. in this way, computers can adapt to conditions that are unforeseen and cannot be codified by static rules. driving a car and chatting with a customer are examples of such jobs. on rare occasions, the computer may even come up with a solution that no human has ever thought of (marr, ; smart nation digital government office, ). for instance, al has been implemented and adopted in industry for a variety of purposes, including (marr , ; sas institute inc-, ): manufacturing: al can be used to optimise areas of production such as yield, energy or throughput optimisation, assembly, and quality testing during the manufacturing process heath care: a personal health care assistant will be able to help with daily tasks (medicine, exercise, diet; detect the patient illness symptom) and to predict chronic disease retail: consumers may do virtual shopping, receive tailored suggestions, and discuss their purchasing alternatives. with the help of al, the business will grow faster banking: al improves speed, precision , effectiveness of human error with ability to detect the fraudulent of unusual transactions, etc public sector: make smart cities smarter, support the national defense, enhance effectiveness of the public services, etc. the application of al is limitless: it will always depend on its purpose, ie. who and where should al be adopted, must be carefully determined: . alignment to vision artificial intelligence's progress and spread provide new and significant problems for technologists, humanity, and sentient life in general. the question of what_~or whose_~values al systems should be associated with is the most important of these (gabriel, ) furthermore, there is a lack of clarity and consistency in the worldwide debates about al that are taking place among governments and the private sector on what the guiding principles should be for policymakers, academics,  and companies. there is widespread agreement that legislative   guidelines and safeguards are needed for the use of ai/ml (artificial intelligence/machine learning) in healthcare; but; before effective legislation can be developed, there must be consensus on the technology's vision and goal.  key



regulation is built on the foundation of pre-existing ideas and beliefs about what technology is, what it seeks to achieve, and how it should be utilised: this involves () determining how it will not be utilised and () assessing the risks that should be avoided. organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd) al principles identify as the following (oecd, ): al should benefit people and the planet by driving inclusive growth, sustainable development; and well-being al systems should be designed in a way that respects the rules of law, human rights; democratic values, and diversity, and should include appropriate safeguards for example, enabling human intervention where necessary to ensure a fair and just society there should be transparency and responsible disclosure around al systems to ensure that people understand al-based outcomes and can challenge them al systems must function in a robust, secure and safe way throughout their life cycles, and potential risks should be continually assessed and managed organisations and  individuals  developing, deploying or operating al systems should be held accountable for their proper functioning in line with the above principles: the oecd also provides specific recommendations to governments on to put these value- based principles into action: facilitate public and private investment in research and development to spur innovation in trustworthy al foster  accessible al ecosystems with   digital infrastructure and technologies and mechanisms to share data and knowledge ensure a policy environment that will open the way to deployment of trustworthy al systems empower people with the skills for al and support workers for a fair transition co-operate across borders and sectors to progress on responsible stewardship of trustworthy al. the application of the oecd principles is still questioning since many organisations have their own principles of al usage as well these themes call out areas that need to be addressed in any future policy or law governing the use of al such as privacy, accountability, safety and security, transparency and explainability,  fairness and non-discrimination, human control of technology, professional responsibility, and promotion of human values. to fit with cambodia's vision of the future for utilisation of al, strategic adaptation of al usage, the concepts from the oecd and other major organisations should be examined in order to develop country rule, they how key



legislation, regulation, and guidelines on how al should be utilised for government, private, and corporate purposes. . al-powered business and industry: transforming business landscape in cambodia . . business artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionise many aspects of business, from improving decision-making and automation to enabling new products and services. in recent years, al has become increasingly widespread in business, with many organisations adopting al technologies to a competitive edge. however, cambodian businesses are yet to take a full advantage of al solutions. one of the key ways that al is being used in business is for decision-making and automation: al algorithms are able to process vast amounts of data and identify patterns and trends that can inform business decisions  this allows organisations to make more accurate and efficient decisions, which can lead to improved operations and increased profitability. in addition, al is being used to automate many tasks and processes in business: for example, al algorithms can be used to automate customer service, data entry, and other routine tasks, freeing up employees to focus on more complex and value-added activities. this can help to increase productivity and reduce costs. in cambodia; simple machine al for use in industrial factories is being developed by quantum engineering and manufacturing: another area where al is having a significant impact on business is in the development of new products and services. al algorithms are being used to create personalised experiences for customers, such as personalised product recommendations and personalised content: this can help to improve customer satisfaction and fidelity , and can also drive revenue growth. however; the use of al in business is not without its challenges one of the key issues is the need for specialised skills and expertise. developing and deploying al algorithms requires a high level of technical knowledge, and many organisations may struggle to find the necessary talent: in addition; there are often ethical and privacy concerns surrounding the use of al in business, and organisations need to carefully consider these issues some of the industries that can benefit from al in cambodia are healthcare, education, and finance. for healthcare, al can be used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnoses; and to identify potential health risks and preventative measures. for example, al can analyse medical images and identify abnormalities, such as tumors or other potential health issues: this can help to improve the quality of healthcare and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis: there are currently already developed equipment and tools that cambodian healthcare centers can acquire and implement:  gain



in addition, al can be used in education in cambodia to improve the quality of and accessibility to education: for example, al can be used to create personalised learning experiences for students, allowing them to learn at their own pace and in a way that is tailored to their individual needs. this can help to improve student outcomes and increase the efficiency of the education system. another area where al is beginning to have an impact in cambodia is in finance. al is being used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of financial transactions, and to identify potential fraud and money laundering: this can help improve the security and reliability of the financial system, and can also help increase the access to financial services for individuals and businesses: al is transforming many aspects of business, and its impact is to continue to grow in the coming years. organisations that are able to effectively adopt and integrate al technologies are likely to gain a competitive advantage, while those that are unable to do so may struggle to keep pace in the competition. overall, the development and adoption of al in cambodia is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to transform many aspects of society: the key challenges and opportunities in this area include the need for specialised skills and expertise, as well as the need to address ethical and privacy concerns: with continued investment and development, al has the potential to greatly benetit cambodia in the coming years. .. infrastructure artificial intelligence is a rapidly growing field that has the potential to transform many aspects of society , from healthcare and transportation to finance and education. however, for al to reach its full potential, it requires a robust infrastructure that can support the development and deployment of al systems: currently in cambodia, there is no proper al infrastructure that allows complex development in the field. in this report; we will explore the current state of al infrastructure and discuss some of the key challenges and opportunities in this area generally and in cambodia (sallomi et al., ). al infrastructure refers to the hardware, software, and other resources that are needed to support the development and deployment of al systems (muller, ) . it includes the hardware and software platforms, data storage and management systems, and other tools and resources that are required to build, train, and deploy al models: one of the components of al infrastructure is the hardware on which al algorithms are run in recent years, there has been a significant increase in the availability of specialised hardware for al, such as graphical processing units and tensor processing units. these hardware platforms are designed to be highly efficient at running the complex calculations required by many al algorithms, allowing them to perform faster and more accurately. however, the development of likely key



specialised hardware for al is not without its challenges: one of the key issues is the cost of these platforms, which can be prohibitively expensive for many organisations. in addition, the rapid pace of innovation in the al hardware space means that the hardware used for al today may quickly become outdated: another important component of al infrastructure is the availability of data. al algorithms require large amounts of high-quality data to be trained and tested: the availability of data is therefore a key factor in the development of al systems. however; the collection and curation of high-quality data can be a time-consuming and expensive process. in addition, there are often privacy and ethical concerns surrounding the use of data for al purposes. one potential solution to these challenges is the use of synthetic data, which is data that is generated artificially rather than collected from real-world sources: synthetic data has the advantage of being readily available and controllable, but it can be difficult to ensure that it accurately reflects the real-world conditions that al systems will encounter (dilmegani, ): in addition to hardware and data, al infrastructure also includes the software tools and platforms that are used to develop and deploy al systems there are a wide variety of tools and platforms available, ranging from open-source libraries and frameworks to proprietary software tools. this includes programming languages such as python, and libraries such as tensorfiow, and pytorch, as well as tools for data preprocessing, model training, and model deployment: these tools and platforms can make it easier for developers to build and deploy al systems, but can also introduce their own challenges, such as vendor lock-in and the need for specialised skills. other parts of al infrastructure include the data storage and management systems to store and organise the large datasets that are used to train and test al models  this may include data warehouses, databases, and other storage systems that are designed to handle the scale and complexity of al data: overall, the development of al infrastructure is a complex and rapidly evolving field: for a country like cambodia to participate in this development; it requires a combination of specialised hardware, high-quality data, and powerful software tools and platforms: the challenges and opportunities in this area are numerous, but with continued investment and innovation, al has the potential to transform many aspects of society in the coming years. thus, a robust plan for al investment and implementation might be a worthwhile challenge for cambodia. artificial intelligence (ai) has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of business, from improving decision-making and automation to enabling new products and services. moreover, cambodian businesses are to take full advantage of al solutions: they yet



one keyway al is used in the business is for decision-making and automation: hence, al algorithms can process vast amounts of data and identify patterns and trends that can inform business decisions, allowing organizations to make more accurate and efficient decisions, leading to improved operations and increased profitability. in addition, al is being used to automate many tasks and processes in business for example, ai algorithms can automate customer service, data entry, and other routine tasks, freeing employees to focus on more complex and value-added activities (scheneider , ). this can help to increase productivity and reduce costs. for example, in cambodia, simple machine al for use in industrial factories is being developed by quantum engineering and manufacturing: another area where al is having a significant impact on business is in the development of new products and services. for example, al algorithms create personalized customer experiences, such as product recommendations and content; that can help improve customer satisfaction and loyalty and drive revenue growth: however, the use of al in business has its challenges. one of the key issues is the need for specialized skills and expertise. developing and deploying al algorithms requires a high level of technical knowledge; and many organizations may need help finding the necessary talent: in addition; there are often ethical and privacy concerns surrounding the use of al in business, and organizations must carefully consider these issues: for example, there are already developed equipment and tools that cambodian healthcare centres can acquire and implement: in addition, al can be used in education in cambodia to improve the quality and accessibility of education for example, al algorithms can be used to create personalized learning experiences for students, allowing them to learn at their own pace and in a way tailored to their individual  needs, which can improve student outcomes and increase the efficiency of the education system. another area where al is beginning to have an impact in cambodia is finance. al algorithms are being used to improve financial transactions' accuracy and efficiency and identify potential fraud and money laundering: this can improve the security and reliability of the financial system and help increase access to financial services for individuals and businesses. al is transforming many aspects of business, and its impact will continue to grow in the coming years: as a result; organizations that can effectively adopt and integrate al technologies will likely a competitive advantage. at the same time, those unable to do so may need help to keep pace with the competition. overall, the development and adoption of al in cambodia are still in their early stages, but it can potentially transform many aspects of society. the challenges and opportunities in this area include the need for specialized skills and expertise and the need to address ethical and privacy concerns: nevertheless, with continued investment and development; al has the potential to benetit cambodia in the coming years greatly.  gain key



3_ al revolution: global trends and practical applications in today's data-driven world, the application of al around the world continues to grow exponentially: firms and organisations across all sectors strive to maximise the potential of their data, to make improved decisions for commercial purposes and social impact. from a technical perspective, there exists several forms of al applications such as machine learning, deep learning, hybrid learning, and digital   twins: according to pricewaterhousecoopers (), machine learning can be utilised for 3d mapping of bridge construction based on data from drones, as well as for spotting insider trading: in addition, deep learning is being used to develop customer behavior models: furthermore, hybrid  learning that is based on probabilistic programming in using incomplete information to work with   uncertainty, can be beneficial for analysing market behavior and regulatory environments finally, digital twins that replicate virtually physical and non-physical assets, are ideal for capital project management and helping financial institutions to model individual policyholders, as well as simulate future balance sheets and cash flows: moving onto more practical use cases of al, massachusetts institute of technology sloan "" trends in data and al for  and beyond"" mentions that: "") companies continue bold momentum, ) customer experience analytics take center stage, ) those who leverage external data outperform competitors by double digits, ) chief data officers lead the charge toward a data-driven culture, ) data science loses its luster, and ) data exposes wide gaps in equity and also empowers change' trend ) companies continue bold momentum focuses on the continuous growth of al applications during the covid- pandemic, including the acceleration of cloud migration plans, taking advantage of this disruptive period to challenge the status quo and undergo digital transformation, as well as focusing on the first % of change which is often the most challenging step. trend ) customer experience analytics take center stage highlights the importance of customer-related data to improve customer experience with the help of data fabric and data lakehouse, and analysing different forms of interactions such as voice analytics and customer interaction with chatbots or call centers. trend ) those who leverage external data outperform competitors by double digits emphasises starting with the core business problem, followed by strategising what potential data could be utilised to solve it, in addition to modernising data flows. cindi howson, chief data strategy officer of thoughtspot; shared that the range of data sources has exploded, the only thing lacking here is really your imagination:' trend ) chief data officers (cdos) lead the charge toward a data-driven culture shines a light on the growing significance of cdo roles, in showing companies and employees the efficiency gained with using data, consequently requiring the upskill of workers to take full advantage of new technologies trend ) data science loses its luster discusses the importance of   rebalancing the overemphasis on coding and math, but rather focusing on business application and improving communications skills and data storytelling: trend ) data exposes wide gaps in equity and



empowers change narrows down on the biased data and lack of team diversity building al programs; which in turn; skews the output of al algorithms: in conclusion, the article conveys that al applications should strive for a ""smarter, more fact-driven world, powered by data and analytics"" brown; ). the covid- pandemic has also led to the establishment of a wide range of al applications, in efforts to tackle its resulting challenges. forbes ""the  top artificial intelligence trends for  describes several use cases of al, starting with smarter big data analytics and insights. big data and al applications are being utilised to quickly analyse and interpret data on the spread of the virus around the world, including a natural language processing (nlp) powered search engine to navigate covid- related literature in data sets, as well as machine learning to identify outbreaks with more ease, contact tracing between infected individuals, enabling more accurate diagnoses, predicting virus evolution, and developing more effective lasting vaccinations: in addition, automated detection and prevention is being carried out in the form of drones to detect covid- symptoms such as high temperature of individuals in crowds, in combination with computer vision to analyse camera data. businesses are also utilising data to rebound from the commercial and economic impacts of the pandemic, by predicting behavioral transformation: finally, collaborative al initiatives are being prepared around the world; to shut down the next pandemic before it even starts learning from the past pandemics and the current covid- pandemic, the international exchange of relevant data and best practices will play a major role in preparing for the future (marr, ).  driving al development in cambodia: the power of collaboration generic introduction of the chapter; why is collaboration important? where to start? how to start? what are the challenges for local and global collaboration? what will be the impact of success and failure on building collaboration? collaboration   plays a pivotal role in knowledge   sharing; particularly important for multi- disciplinary/multi-country   research, innovation and development work in many occasions; knowledge sharing occurs through reported articles that are not security-sensitive, do not have intellectual property right (ipr) issues and are not sensitive to financial income. globally , many countries developed strategic agreements to share their knowledge related to security   (for example, the uk with the us) , business and socio-economic growth: data collection, analysis and decision making using al are playing a significant role in this type of knowledge sharing framework the knowledge sharing framework brings various benefits, for example, this saves a significant research or innovation investment for the reinvention of the wheel: the cambodian government and businesses should take initiative to develop similar  regional and global collaboration based on the needs of the socio-economic growth and security of the country: this requires developing a strategic framework for specific data or knowledge to be shared for the 



important sectors: security, innovation and research, crisis and disaster management, cultural understanding; economic growth, health and well-being: failure to build this type of strategic collaborative knowledge   sharing activity will   bring detrimental effects on the sustainable development goals (sdgs) (sustainable development solution network; ) and security (particularly , cybersecurity) of the country: however; the challenges in building collaboration are normally the trust of the stakeholders, barriers for mutual economic benefits and communication/cultural gaps between the   parties. to overcome these challenges, the stakeholders need to communicate and discuss developing a strategic long-term regional and global collaboration framework using data and knowledge sharing infrastructure. .. quadruplel triple helix approach are the stakeholders' engagementlcollaborations important, particularly for a country like cambodia? who will take initiative? how? when? how to prepare a sustainable collaborative framework? what are the key factors that may stimulate applied research and innovation to build collaboration? should we start with quadrupleltriplelboth helix approaches? financing randd policy formulation education innovation incubators government academia spin-off:s support advisory services collaboration entrepreneurial platform venturing legitimatinglink product and industry civfl society competence and service process development development carrying individua and structural perspectives figure . collaborative quadruple helix framework (lindberg et al, ) the stakeholders' engagementlcollaborations are important particularly in a country like cambodia because we need to enhance the development of new knowledge and to transform this knowledge into innovations: cambodia's development challenges include manufacturing;, agriculture, healthcare, transportation, energy, science and technology. the initiative needs to come from the local government as it plays an important role in integrating changes in principles and practices into local development and investment plans: working together to establish   relationships toward a process to generate the outcome of something in common are essential  characteristics that may inspire  applied research and innovation to foster collaboration. because addressing issues requires more than one person,  key why



group, or organisation, collaborative connections are critical; hence, the outcome of collaboration might generate new metrics of success in economic development. collaborative approach includes more than just working together. it refers to the ability to work together and take action on large-scale projects. traditional strategic planning is not a good model for the disciplines that will be required to rebuild our economy. thinking together refers to a series of interactions  involving  academics (the   university) , business, and government  in order to encourage economic and social growth through a triple helix model of innovation. several nations have embraced the triple helix approach to foster innovation through the notion of institutions and policy making: the triple helix interaction pattern is said to be capable of establishing links and interactions between   science and technology, as well as gathering individuals from many disciplines to engage in the process of information exchange; ideas, and thoughts: the quadruple helix paradigm may be regarded as an improvement on the triple helix approach in that it not only focuses on the players from academics, government; and business but also acknowledges society's growing involvement: the framework seeks to bridge the gap between innovation and civil society, claiming that under the triple helix paradigm, new technologies do not necessarily meet societal expectations and requirements, limiting their potential effect: investing more in research, innovation, and entrepreneurship should be at the core of cambodia's development strategy, since it is the only way to achieve smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth. this idea expands on the triple helix model by assuming that society, in addition to academics, business, and government; is a significant actor in innovation processes cambodia may be ideal for creating smart specialisation plans based on the quadruple helix method, which would create an environment conducive to entrepreneurship and innovation; which has been identified as a priority by policymakers and politicians. this is primarily because innovation and entrepreneurship are viewed as means to create new employment while also raising living standards through new and improved products. however, in order for the quadruple helix method to work we need a good leader who can turn knowledge into action. a good leader needs to be good with the group and be able to manage the  multidisciplinarylmulti-countries   collaborative teamwork: how can we   effectively support individuals while simultaneously changing big systems? by follow some of these rules: one conversion at the time, stay focused as design thinking offers an approach for addressing these and other big questions restraint from criticising an idea work with cool ideas and buildable 



work on a time constraint, if not the team will never get anything done mock up combine into a working prototype fail often in order to succeed sooner took the best element out of every prototype and created another workable. lot of hours, be open minded, a leader that is demanding fresh ideas, be quirky and clash with him. belief that chaos can be constructive and teamwork a great deal of teamwork, and these a good recipe for innovation: the team needs to explore the paradox of cross-boundary work and learn about trust dynamics, conflict management; and the advantages and challenges of global teams .. common and inclusive development what are the common issues that may stimulate mutual benefits and opportunities of collaboration? what are the challenges (including the digital divide) for inclusive development? how could we develop a collaborative framework that will help in inclusive development? which stakeholders should contribute to addressing the inclusive issue and in what form a table might help? biasness, inequality and ethical issues related to inclusive development: the common issues that may stimulate mutual benefits and opportunities of collaboration are manufacturing; agriculture, healthcare, transportation, energy, science and technology: the challenges including the digital divide for inclusive development are: skill gap in al at all educational levels this involves revisions at the elementary, secondary, and tertiary levels of education to include al-related courses and programs into school curriculum: it is also necessary to provide chances for instructors to receive training and upskill in order to teach al-related courses: second; numerous policies give specific incentives for large-scale lifelong learning and reskilling via massive open online courses and reskilling: gender inequality in science and technology fields skill shortages are a major impediment to innovation, stifling productivity growth and economic progress. shortages of skilled professionals in areas linked to science, technology, engineering; and mathematics (stem) in particular may limit a society's ability to innovate. over the years, a significant gender disparity has remained at all levels of stem disciplines around the world throughout the world, a significant gender disparity has remained at all levels of stem fields: despite significant gains in women's involvement in higher education; they remain underrepresented in these professions  this issue is particularly serious at the top of academic and professional hierarchies. empirical studies show that countries with a higher proportion of  key key



engineering graduates tend to grow faster than countries with a higher proportion of graduates in other disciplines lack of al policy related to smart governance, smart innovation and smart regulations the absence of information in cambodia refrains academics from furthering their understanding of the problem and policymakers from devising effective remedies this note intends to add to the regional academic and policy discussion by examining the key variables proposed in the literature to explain gender discrepancies in stem recruitment, retention, and promotion, as well as by proposing new factors: ethical, privacy and ipr issues the ethical issues of al applications are growing significantly. this includes data privacy and ipr associated with the data: therefore, a strategic plan is essential to avoid misusing al growth and data associated with that. .3_ global education, research and innovation why is the global collaboration for knowledge sharing through education, research and innovation important? what are types of collaboration to be developed? with which organisationslcountries? how to build these collaborations? what are the funding agencies that may help in stimulating this collaboration? how to develop trainedlskilled manpower to build collaboration hire initially? when to start and where to start? research-informed teaching to accelerate the process national al and data centre for research and development (randd) commercialisation of the outcomes of al research and innovation research, innovation, research-informed teaching and al application development to solve real- world problems are interconnected as shown in figure . it reflects multidisciplinary collaborative teamwork is always to achieve success. al application is a market-driven dynamic area, therefore , requires global collaboration and rapid policy actions to play with the international partners: this also requires   continuously identifying skill gaps in education, research and innovation: based on the gap, there should be a method to train young talent abroad to fill this gap. subsequently, offer an attractive incentive to the trained talent to return to the existing workforce at home. to create this   opportunity, cambodia   needs to develop a strategic collaboration with   regional and global institutions, offer   scholarship based higher  study for  key



talented young people and make an attractive support framework with a national al and data centre as their home. a strategic plan for randd is very important to cope with the al-enabled advancement in the world. the plan should have objectives and a direction of advancements to amplify efficiency. cambodia sees itself thriving significantly in creating world-class research and advancement in some innovation fields: it is obligatory that al is embedded in the randd as well as other divisions to leverage its potential application. based on our investigation, we recommend the following in the strategic plan: need to set up a centre of excellence with leading experts from different backgrounds to work together for al, data and associated technologies collaborative framework (see figure ) with industries, universities, government and young entrepreneurs for applied research and innovation for knowledge transfer regular engagement for knowledge sharing through meetings, seminars and interactive workshops government investment strategy with an appropriate policy framework to promote the job skills of the young people development of research centres in the universities in collaboration with industries and business to promote researchlinnovation informed teaching develop a database of experts in cambodia to promote collaborative activities with government support develop a policy and practices for security, privacy and ethical issues related to the data and ai applications need continuous exploration for potential regional and global research and innovation funds, stafflstudent exchange opportunities and partnership development to exchange knowledge last but not least; develop a strategic framework to attract young people for new skill sets through a public-private partnership finally, cambodia is moving towards a digital economy with new challenges as a middle-income country in . a collaborative framework as shown in figure  with strategic investment and policy is essential to develop skill sets of young people for al applications. as applied research is key to generating knowledge, we need to embed this into the teaching, training and innovation for dynamic technology changes with a focus on sustainable economic growth.

on the micro-level; al can help the market system improve resource allocation and industrial organisation and strengthen firms' competitiveness (phyrom et al,, ). moreover, data and al are said to reduce information asymmetry; which is a form of market failure allowing the market to reach an optimal equilibrium: in terms of labor market structure, opportunities will arise as new kinds of services industries and businesses, namely e-commerce (e.g-, amazon, alibaba, ebay) , e-payment (e.g;, alipay, paypal), and social media (e.g-, facebook, twitter) , will also emerge (phyrom et al, ). and with those come new types of employment: it is predicted by the world economic forum that about  million new jobs will be created by  in several sectors, including artificial intelligence, robotics, immersive technology, green technology, and blockchain (world economic forum; ). in addition, the nature of the employment itself, especially jobs related to software and technology development and multimedia; will be more flexible owing to the fact that now we can collaborate more effectively using an online platform and that workers no longer need to commute to their physical workplace. but at the same time, questions have also been raised about the possible negative impacts of al on patients, especially ethical issues regarding how personal data should be treated: al requires large amount of data which has gradually become a new oil that can be generated endlessly every and such data is handy for many ways and reasons, yet it can pose serious challenges if it falls into the wrong hands or rival countries, and that will compromise national securities along with other dimensions of socio-economic development   considering the current cambodian context   in which   cybersecurity  is limited in infrastructure and human knowledge,  security breaches should be the top priority: it should be highlighted that al still needs data, and al is useless if the data is bad or contaminated by cybercriminals who might use the data to sell in the black market or for scamming purposes because the data is both marketable and profitable. in addition, increasing the use of big data and algorithms or artificial intelligence in general also means an increase in energy use which may hinder cambodia's progress toward goals  and . the latter is about taking action against climate change by regulating coz emissions, improving energy efficiency, and reducing fuel power consumption: even though cambodia has almost achieved universal energy coverage, energy is mostly accessible among the urban population, while the rural population still finds it difficult to gain access to a state-provided electrical power and without stable and sufficient energy; al might not be useful for rural development; particularly in the agriculture and manufacturing industry, further engendering digital division between rural and urban areas. al effects on the reduced inequalities (goal ) is also questionable , for it is still an expensive technology since data is costly to collect; and expertise in developing algorithms is hard to come by even for developed countries, let alone the developing one. as a result; it is only affordable by the richer   countries rather than; the poorer nations, and that will   exacerbate the current  day; grid.



inequalities among countries, for the developed states tend to be the ones who can build exorbitant infrastructure to support al expansion and application, and thus they are able to enjoy more benefits deriving from it: in the case of an individual country such as cambodia; al technology is likely to be able to afford only by the rich or major corporations, which tends to increase income inequality. although al might help boost productivity, the benefits might not really go towards the poor, creating an obvious two highly divided segments in a single society and thereby social issues: it is suggested that a strong mechanism such as a progressive tax to counter the byproduct or externality of al should be in placed first: on top of that; artificial intelligence is likely to place blue-collar workers on the brink of job loss and subsequently increase inequalities within a nation (brynjolfsson and mcafee, ). it is worth noting that workers need to have decent skills to operate industry . technology which tends to reward educated individuals handsomely yet at the same time heavily punish low-skilled workers who conventionally come from a disadvantaged background: this partially helps explain why there has been an increase in the wage gap between college and high school graduates in the united states: additionally, more automation is translated into less human labor. hence, al is likely to reduce demand for but increase the supply of manual workers, decrease their wages, and eventually transfer more wealth from workers to firm owners: in cambodia; such a structural change in the economy can be detrimental considering that the vast majority of workers in the manufacturing industries, including the garment sector, are liow-skilled young adults who are unlikely to utilise al technology and hence prone to job displacement: it is explicable that there is always a tradeoff between efficiency and equity, but there must be more winners than losers. and the losers should be compensated fairly. in this regard, a process to do so must be considered first before implementing al technology to ensure that national technology advancement policies are not there only to enrich firms and employers; otherwise, al-led economic development will lead to even more social challenges. simply put; it does more harm than good to society. with that said, a valid question should be asked: is cambodia ready? cambodia's commitment to  responsible innovation and   research ethics   provides a solid foundation for integrating al ethics into its sti policy: by balancing scientific progress with ethical considerations, cambodia fosters integrity and social responsibility: upholding human security, addressing bias and discrimination, and promoting transparency and accountability are aspects of al ethics that cambodia towards a future where al benefits society while safeguarding its values: .. skilling and re-skilling the workforce in cambodia technology has been changing the nature of the workforce in all sectors, from small and medium- sized enterprises (smes) to big industry, which lead the trends of the new jobs require the 21st century skills (world bank group, ). it is expected that by , nearly  million new jobs  key guide



will be created by using digital technology (world economic forum; ). emerging technologies such as cloud computing, big data, cyber security, immersive technology, game, al, cobotics, internet of things   (lots) , block-chain and 3d printing are likely to adopted by industries, businesses, health and well-being, agriculture and education in the future. it is reported that at least % of the tasks (% of current occupations) are at high risk, and % of the jobs the next generation will do in  do not exist (rethy et al,, ). it is well recognised that there are no ways to tackle the 4th industrial revolution, especially job-loss issues without skilling and re-skilling the al workforce: in this regard, it is very crucial for government and stakeholders to prepare the digital skill sets for the future labour force. according to van laar et al: in , the 21st century digital skills are technical knowledge, information finding creativity and   innovation, critical   thinking, reasoning and complex   problem solving, and interpersonal skills such as communication, collaboration, negotiation and teamwork  with the industrial revolution ., countries around the world, as well as cambodia have developed their own strategies and policies related to al. stem education policy was proposed to encourage students to go for stem majors after their graduating from high school whereas technical and vocational education and training (tvet) policy and -year cambodia digital economy and society policy framework were to promote technical and technology skill development (ratha and phirom; ). similarly; to make the existing workforce survive and make it ready for those entering the workplace, the cambodia's sti roadmap  and policy focus on improving human capita in science and technology, especially al in both quantity and quality, and gender equity. the current highly skilled workforce in cambodia is still in low number which necessitate an education system reform to prepare in building modern skillsets for the future (world bank group; ) . from the employer perspective, as shown in figure 3_ skills in cambodia (bruni et al:_ ) , the most major skill gap is foreign language skills, and practical skills (bruni et al._ ). in reskilling and upskilling for the human resource of the 21st century, all education levels need to adapt to al education curriculum which al and digital literacy should have been introduced to our young people since their early age of study. building up strong background for students in math; english , critical thinking; art, design, animation and coding is crucial in making pathway for them to step foot into the future modern skills (hor and hesketh; ). in addition to the education reform, to strengthen the future skill sets, it is requiring the participants from all the stakeholders such as governments, universities, industries and societies. to ensure the workforces are ready to meet the future demands of the domestic and foreign labour market; government should give priority to innovative research, stem education, creativity, and critical thinking skills. apart from al and  digital   knowledge, emotional intelligent skills such as working as a team and communicating with other people are significant for the company well performing, productivity increment; and collaborating with outsiders_  yet ability , gap

three significant challenges that will be needed to exploit full potential of al applications: data collection and accessibility, inter-disciplinary knowledge sharing framework, and shortage of talent who can improve al capabilities, stimulate new ideas, and implement solutions to address the challenges, cambodia can develop the following strategic pillars of al: i) centre of excellence for applied research, innovation, training; and implementation, ii) skilling and reskilling of al and associated workforce with local and global institutional supports, ii) data, knowledge sharing framework and digital infrastructure, iv) gdpr, ethics, data privacy, security, v) funding support for accelerating al start-ups, research and  innovations, and vi)  industrialisation/commercialisationldeployment of the al- enabled technologies. table 1_ technology field needed by sectors (hor and hesketh, ) al data immersive cyber block 3d sectors lots game robotics algorithms analysis technology securitylchain |printing education x industry x x x aeaculture   x| h x x |  business x x the points to setup a roadmap are as follows: research, innovation and development capacity building of national human resources targeting a country of innovators promotion of a culture of adopting advanced technologies and al empower and enable industries for human-machine collaboration to boost incomes and employment dynamic scaling-up for new skilling and align resources with imaginative types of reskilling to prepare representatives at all domains to work with al-enabled solutions. .. data privacy, ethic, security and regulations while al promises a positive net   benefit   for  society and economy, it also poses a great responsibility and risk when it comes to privacy, ethics, and security. as one may define al, it is machine brain that accumulates learnings from data to create intelligence rather than rules explicitly codified by human programmers to perform tasks automatically: the key here is that the decision is increasingly being made by machine rather than human as it is enabled by data; computing resources, and advanced algorithms. decisions made by al could have consequences that affect fundamental rights and human beings. the question is to what extent al decisions can be trustworthy, ethical and conformed to intrinsic human fundamental rights and values?  key



overview of the data protection and regulation in cambodia cambodia has not yet enacted any comprehensive data protection legislation. the first to the country's data protection landscape has come in the form of the e-commerce law (only available in khmer) , which contains provisions for the protection of consumer data that has been gathered over the course of   electronic   communication: the e-commerce law is thereby restricted in scope to virtual andlor digital data protection. currently only few laws and regulations that express privacy and data protection include the constitution, civil code, laws on telecommunications and the press laws. ministry of interior lawyers and data specialists chaired a meeting to discuss the first draft of a sub-degree on the management; use, privacy safeguard and security of data the governments have collected that can potentially be used to identify individuals on january , . on january , specialists from the ministry's legislation council and heads of the ministry's general directorates and departments discussed an initial draft comprising six chapters and  articles: the purpose of this sub-decree was to determine rules for the management, use and privacy protections for identifying data that would serve public interests, promote service provision quality and develop the nation in a highly efficient and secure manner: data protection and regulation vision cambodia seeks to harmonise among the existing laws and  rights mentioned earlier   for standardisation into a more targeted and specific data protection laws that governs sensitive personal data and its security needs across its lifespans in capture, storage, sharing; use, and archive. cambodia desires to balance risks and create conditions for a trustworthy al sector to grow in a healthy, responsible and safe manner with initiatives to establish a national ethical framework committee body and data   regulation laws conformed to the regional and international standards: that way, principles and practices for unbiased use of al are formed to promote fairness, ethics, inclusivity, transparency, and accountability so that citizens and businesses can adopt the use of al in a protected and safe manner: cambodia recognises risks of heavy regulation seeing regulation may be too strict because it forfeit foreign investment in the technology sector; especially so in a small country like cambodia without sufficiently qualified human resources and technological advancement to manage data centres and security at the scale big tech firms are capable of. cambodia and its citizens have to answer this question as we move into the digital economy: why would large digital technology and manufacturing firms rather invest in cambodia and not in   singapore or   vietnam? what competitive advantage and drivers do we exhibit relative to neighboring countries in attracting and  update may



retaining foreign investment? with an understanding that regulation in nature tends to de- motivate innovation and slow down growth in exchange for a safer and fairer society as regulation increases compliance responsibility and constrains business behaviors to a set of social, ethical, and legal norms especially if poorly designed and implemented. heavy regulation will likely hurt local digital businesses who emerge to cultivate innovation and experimentation to create new business lines and stimulate growth because they may not prepare to take administrative and compliant burdens; while a lack of regulatory clarity injects fears of heavy fines that could destroy business startup and survival: having said that; it is in the nation's interest to establish data protection laws to manage harms while providing regulatory clarity to guide businesses in ways of handing user data and consent;, particularly user identifiable information such as name, date of birth, identity, and any other data objects that could reveal an individual identity. importantly, the world has increased the level of sophistication in digitalisation that captures and processes data across multiple jurisdictions so data protection laws to provide regulatory clarity for cross-border data management and cloud technology adoption guidelines will be established. because unlawful and iil intention usage of these data   especially by bad actors cause harm to users, and therefore subject to legal responsibilities; penalty and fines. in this effort, cambodia looks to legislate data protection laws to make businesses and service providers accountable to the management, collection and usage of data in a responsible manner and nurture al fields for maximum benefits with respect to foundational elements of human rights while promoting adoption for economic gains. data privacy and ethics article  of the universal declaration of human rights treats privacy as a distinct human right. stated one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence. everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks_ in the cambodian laws, it mentioned that citizens have rights to privacy: definitive meanings to what privacy are remains ambiguous and subject to legal interpretation. however, data privacy often refers to the rights to be left alone and rights to be free of independent thoughts: even so, privacy is a broad term that is essential to human dignity and autonomy for individual freedom: yet when conflicted with other laws, rights to privacy may be restricted under certain conditions like to protect national security and public safety. for example, in the matter of criminal offenses to protect public safety the state may authorise and require persons or entities to reveal one's individual identity without the needs of the user's consent who is under suspicion. in this regard to the privacy needs of citizens,  cambodia looks to establish a guideline to encourage organisations of all sizes to adopt privacy-by-design approach to developing al applications while the establishment of the national committee of ethics will champion the guidelines and direction for the incorporation of ethics and privacy for al. given how early-stage  along ""no



al is in cambodia and for many organisations of all sizes, it may be impractical to copy and paste regulation requirements from the likes of european union's general data protection regulation (gdpr): a customised and localised standard data privacy and protection laws will be likely to align with the asean regions. basic elements like the collection of personal data shall have user consent and provide purpose information to such usages that protect user privacy and security. individuals shall have rights to request, access, update, and remove at its user cost. cambodia sees al development conform to the ethical framework and social norms to ensure human values are protected, inclusion is encouraged, and fairness is   preserved without systematic discrimination against   humanity that causes perceptual bias and harms: the discrimination may be classified into a category of race, gender, physical ability, and economic background. right protection to equitable, just and fair treatment in society is a fundamental responsibility of the state when it comes to inter-relation conflicts among individuals, businesses and government agents. however, it is the responsibilities of the organisations andlor goods and service providers that create al applications and mismanage user data that affects one' ethical values: decisions made by al applications that affect society's fundamental and ethical values shall be thought out by design and undergo a standard user and system acceptance test aimed at ensuring a trustworthy al. critical decisions whether in health, credit loan, insurance claim, and employment shall provide reasonable explanations to support why such decisions are being made. when in doubt, humans should be in the loop to ensure al decisions behave as expected and trusted: and al decisions are ethically sound and have a base of ethical foundation aligned to cambodian constitutions and ethical framework data security data security is the process of safeguarding data against unauthorised access and corruption throughout its lifespan from data collection, sharing; usage, and deletion. with the growing risks of attacks and intrusion, organisations adopting al at any scale shall invest to build cybersecurity capability in human resource and security technologies to govern, protect and manage its data assets: data security methods such as data  encryption, hashing, and tokenisation are essential to the way data is safeguard and protected across all applications and platforms: because management of user data is ultimately the responsibility of good and service providers, security governance and checks shall be in place to protect user information from cyber security attack, leaks, scams, fraud, and loss. risks of cyberthreats shall be studied, assessed and minimised at the organisation disposal. the intended or unintended consequences of poor management of data may cause various harms to users so corporate organisations who handle large personal data especially related to personal finance and health shall be accountable and able to demonstrate compliance reporting: the organisation shall have at least a minimum of one in charge of creating and mandating its data policy , security, and governance.  cyber key person



in general, cambodia desires to establish data   protection laws and guidelines to provide regulatory clarity for all data processes across its life spans and to protect users with regards to data privacy and ethics. service providers shall adapt to a human rights by-design approach to minimise unintentional or hidden biases, any discrimination or other negative consequences on individuals with respect to human rights and basic freedoms. the government of cambodia aims to design a well-informed regulatory framework consisting of best practices in the growing subject of trustworthy al, while emphasising the need of using al in a fair, transparent; accountable, and responsible manner. .. strategic investment for al-powered cambodia after a series of up, down and side turns, the development of al technology has made great progress globally emerging from research labs into more socially useful and commercially viable technology applications that present massive opportunities for a modern economy and society. some refers to al impact and disruption from the change and technological innovation to the early days' invention of electricity, steam and water as well as the automobiles, computers and the internet today: with billions of dollars expected to generate from al globally, cambodia sees the need and urgency to invest; adopt and prepare for this al global force in line with industry . trend as the economy increasingly becomes knowledge and digital based. a strategic investment in the field of al introduces three major pillars to maximise benefits and minimise risks in the facilitation of al development for nation-wide adoption, safety and sustainability: invest in people building the nation capacity for a resilient workforce, growth and innovation invest in technological infrastructure building a robust foundation invest in a collaborative tech ecosystem building a sustained network of value providers. these strategic views aim to drive cambodia's competitiveness in the region and attract foreign investment: as a small, growing nation rising from ashes, cambodia is not in a position seeking to be a leader of al in most domains but to strengthen its emerging role to contribute to the global economy as a hub for applied al with young people talents to rapidly and innovatively prototype solutions to solve state-level, societal and economic problems. an investment in human capital, digital infrastructure, and ecosystem development help cambodia maximise at every stage of development and adoption, while randd in niched areas are encouraged to be innovative and pioneering: the investment in randd also prevents critical adoption barriers and accelerates the use of al for economic and societal benefits: for example, without investing in the core khmer nlp cambodia cannot maximise its benefits from al applications like  yet gains



conversational chatbot using khmer and any others that build on top of nlp requiring the native language. cambodia also aims to establish a data protection regulation to provide regulatory clarity and ensure accountability for a trust worth al to flourish responsibly that is in line with asean and international data protection laws as well as conforms to the established social norms within an ethical framework with respect to human rights. ... invest in people building the nation capacity for a resilient workforce, growth and innovation this is in line with section .. skilling and re-skilling the workforce and the rectangular strategy iv from the government of cambodia. it looks to refine its positioning and competitiveness in the regional play: needless to say, al will disrupt and impact labor employment categories, which require strategic initiatives to facilitate labor mobility, rapid skills building and upgrading; skills transfers, and access to information. one of the greatest assets cambodia has is its tech-savvy young population, where almost two-third of the population is under  years old. more and more young people are equipped with english speaking ability which will serve the needs of digital knowledge workers in the new era and in the asean economic integration for labour mobility and interaction: by leveraging the rising young; talented individuals and tech startup entrepreneurs to build phnom penh digital hub for innovative applications, technology and data talents, cambodia is prepared in human resource development to achieve higher middle-income status by . people capability development is not only to build a home-grown young workforce sufficient to supply the country's economy but also the regional and international economy: a number of factors are considerations when it comes to al talent development: ... mindset and literacy the government of cambodia recognises building capacity for the labor workforce is a long-run effort: change management starts with mindset themselves, their family and institutions. the government aims to raise awareness and educate the population about the potential uses of al, benefits, and its risks  this introduction aims at raising the national average level of digital literacy around basic technology usage so all segments of citizens including disable persons, lower-income group, female and elder can reap full benefits and not be digitally excluded: as al becomes more prevalent, relationships between humans and machines will also need to develop and strengthen for a safe, knowledgeable, and growing society. digital literacy programs around al and stem education will be campaigned and promoted targeting ) the general population ) parents for their confidence in job prospects of their kids' decision to enter stem education ) youths themselves to be aware and access information as they make informed educational decisions: the government will also look into policy design for promoting the demand side for al and digital talents to power their institutions in both private and public sector such as tax credits for workforce training, and in particular act as the public-private collaboration and protection  key any



enabler to increase private sectors' incentives for maximum impact and reduce frictional risks for a striving digital economy. all initiatives will be to ensure digital mindset; literacy, and attitude toward al are well received and cover both the supply and demand side when it comes to human resource planning and development. ... stem graduates strong and growing economy highly correlates with stem education as it serves to build labor forces to fill needs from the private and public sector: more importantly, with the applications of al, stem workers will need to think,; build, operate, and maintain al. critical preconditions like this for the al sector to flourish in cambodia will be explored, assessed and acted upon to build a robust local  talent pool in the field and overtime change the  dynamic of  foreign talent dependencies. cambodia has made and continues to level up its effort to increase the number of stem graduates per year working with the ministry of education, youth and sport and in building early age interests of children toward stem education, ensuring a sizable enrollment and minimal drop out in universities across city and provinces later on: with the recognition of the needs for practical lab and applied studies, cambodia aims to foster and promote public-private partnerships such as employers and education institutions to establish internship standards that mutually benefit both the students and organisations. this effort is intended to establish educational and employment iinks and create more chances of success, for example with government sponsored local and international internship programs in the stem areas which will be shared, promoted and standardised. sending students abroad for stem internships will give them practical experience and exposure to the international work environment and standards while keeping brain drain in-check collectively; it drives international competitiveness for employment opportunities when it comes to quality talents for local and international employers. along with productivity gains expected for the economy with stem graduates, their income is also expected to rise drastically into a new income bracket thus leveling up a multi-generational, socio-economic impact to them, families and society: ... tvet graduates beyond a stem degree program, a new tvet education focusing on ict are welcomed and promoted to complement university degree standards. companies expect graduates to come with soft and technical skills that reflect the changing nature of industry and technology so require a rapidly evolving and regularly updated curriculum for quality teaching and practical excellence. a number of classroom-to-career institutions will be promoted to provide short-term, high skills, industry-relevant technology training to meet the rapid needs from private sector organisations and smes cambodia aims to support these specific skills development programs especially in 



the digital and technology fields such as but not limited to computer training, al, software engineering, blockchain, robotics, data science, computer programming, and security: ... life-long learning for upskill and re-skill workforce in addition to these above education standards, cambodia looks to develop life-long learning opportunities in its efforts to upskill and re-skill both private and public sector staff. cambodia intends to explore e-skill credits where individuals can apply and use the credits with third-party providers to receive the training; developing their resilient adaptation to the inevitable force of automation and preparing for new job category creation by ai. overall the life-long learning initiatives will increase citizen professional growth opportunities for better employment and higher income while boosting the nation's productivity. the impact of job loss and creation due to al will be carefully studied in the context of cambodia and plan initiatives for rapid upskill and reskilling implementation programs working with key multi-stakeholders including international development  organisations  and training  providers. cambodia has witnessed the impact  of covid19 pandemic that destroyed by-and-large the tourism sector that the economy has largely depended on. this major source of income powering the economy has been depleted with great uncertainty moving into the post-covid era: garment  manufacturing sector, which has also significantly contributed to cambodia's gdp, is another area greatly vulnerable to the global development of al, high-tech investment and automation: it is a national concern that has been shared among ministries and development partners: having said that; cambodia works proactively to take calculated risks, minimise the expected damage, and cultivate opportunities that al will create such as through the upskill and re-skill efforts to ensure a positive net impact from ai: ... invest in technological infrastructure building for a robust foundation digital infrastructure is the backbone of a thriving economy for the internet era: a strong digital foundation is essential to maximise the benefits at scale with minimal security risks for vibrant and safe technological development in society: ... connectivity and telecommunication cambodia enjoys a high mobile and broadband penetration rate telecommunication services are provided with national-wide network coverage at affordable prices for customers--partly thanks to a regulatory environment that fosters market competition among mobile operators. advancement in telecommunication technology such as the introduction of 5g infrastructure and fast-speed fiber optic will also further increase the nation's connectivity. while a high penetration rate of mobile phones and connectivity coverage is well acknowledged, cambodia government will continue a regulatory environment that promotes investments to better telecommunications  cyber key



networks and services that support al research, applications and usage. particularly it aims to boost connectivity infrastructure further and promote public-private partnerships among hardware manufacturers, internet service providers and interested economic actors to increase household access and affordability for available hardware devices and fast-speed, high quality internet connection thus increasing citizen   participation in the digital economy and reap potential benefits: ... digital and data infrastructure in line with the .. data and digital infrastructure section, strategic investment into building a robust data and digital infrastructure ensures cambodia facilitates the development of the al sector. al randd requires storage and computing resources to be utilised in a collaborative, safe and secure manner. cambodia will support the digital infrastructure architecture with high- performance physical servers and software in preparation for the country's ambition toward a digital economy and create a digital sandbox for innovation and collaboration among private sectors and research institutions to prototype solutions to societal and commercial applications of ai. cambodia aims to develop a national data center facility to manage computing, data storage and network services to ensure smooth operation. initiatives will also be taken around boosting the quality and access of the high-performant internet, computer network, security system, data center, social media, software, mobile and web applications: ... invest in the emerging technologies cambodia government embraces digital technologies as we ve seen in the industry . agenda for e-government adoption at the state-level because it believes icts enable innovation for the country and not stifle it. the gap between the current pace of global technological development and adoption ability in cambodia is increasingly widened for many areas; only a few niches where we are noticeably recognised as early adopters these niches can be said for the case of the bakong blockchain-based technology system by the national bank of cambodia as among the first central banks in the world to deploy such revolutionary tech. the technology facilitates the settlement among financial institutions and lowers the cost of inter-cooperation for all end-users thus increasing financial access and inclusion. another case can be said for the id-poor on- demand  digital  system and graph database by the ministry of planning working with development partners such as deutsche gesellschaft fur internationale zusammenarbeit gmbh and australian aid to better social registry and social protection with targeted assistance provision to the right poor households these technologies are newly adopted in cambodia and have not been done at the same scope or scale before but have shown great promise, feasibility and nation-level impact; thus for the digital ambition that cambodia strives to achieve will require investment into testing newly  emerged   technologies,  fostering a culture of trial-and-error experimentation with more collaborative randd institutions, and building a know-how absorptive  any key



ability for the nation to scale up the implementation efforts. some examples of these emerging technologies include distributed big data storage with hadoop/spark for a single source of identity information; decentralised   applications with blockchain around ownership rights and data traceability with a security standard, internet of things such as drones and robotics to better agricultural output, digital platforms for e-services to increase citizen and business participation, cloud computing integration technologies with regulatory clarity and feasibility assessment to enable business organisations' accessibility for the world's powerful technological infrastructure and platforms to increase their productivity output per unit cost of production: ... invest in a collaborative tech ecosystem building an ecosystem for a sustained network of value providers cambodia has the opportunity to achieve economic, security, and social gains in the al sector for many domains: yet it lacks key enabled and supported areas. for example, for e-commerce to function in the economy, which has taken a long time until it is being adopted more widely now in its growth acceleration partly thanks to the e-commerce law enacted in , it requires not only the digital marketplace for buyers and sellers, but also logistics, digital payment; and customer protection that facilitates it. it is nearly impossible for any individual business to build every aspect at the same time thus relying on an ecosystem of various economic actors in the provision of products and services. the cambodian government has made big steps and is committed to promote a robust collaborative ecosystem to increase overall benefits and reduce collaboration cost for the ecosystem actors one area is in the promotion of a vibrant startup ecosystem and tech hub supported by a local and international collaboration: for example, the co-investment initiatives with private institutional investors increases access to finance for startup and sme entrepreneurs with khmer enterprise's entrepreneurship fund by the ministry of economic and finance. it also brings a well-known global vc (startup ) through its international collaboration and local corporations' partners to nurture the startup ecosystem: tech entrepreneurship is demonstrated as a career path option which is actively promoted in addition to stem workers: cambodia encourages economic activities and initiatives that drive the next generation of digital businesses and startups that use digital and al technologies through national award, grants, and investment. .. research and innovation this section explores the state of the art of research landscape in cambodia about al. more importantly, the innovative aspect of the knowledge from al research will be discussed in the context: at this point; it is important to root the term ""innovation"" viewed by charpie in  . he emphasised that innovation is made if five steps are made; which includes basic invention from ideas (ideation) , engineering design (micro piloting) , manufacturing (industrial scale) , 



manufacturing startup (making a startup), and market diffusion (generating profit) . al will be ubiquitous in our daily life in next decade, especially in decision making process, improving workflow and efficiency, health care, education, and financial sector: for instance, it is suggested that al capacity will surely add value to the efficiency and accuracy of clinicians (thomas et al,, ). data will be the driving for al development: internet users are the main contributor of data for al. the materialisation of al stock of al knowledge for economic purposes is an innovation approach. contextually , cambodia requires strategic investment in the field if the kingdom wishes to unleash the potential of al for socio-economic development: some important investment could be financing, infrastructure development; talent development; and   supportive regulatory framework three types of data are being collected for al, which are identity data, network data, and behavior data (ma; ). identity data refers to data of individual, entity, or identity or information characteristic to identify a person or institution. network data refers to data of location from direct input to any application or usage of any particular application. behavior data refers to data that users browse in websites, social media, apps or in other application interfaces the three data are the important resources for al. a triple helix model of market driven research on al could be reiterated most of the discussion: the world is facing the rapid accumulation of knowledge on al, while   private sector is harnessing the   potential of the field: however; consequences and various potential risks arising from this development has posed a great attention among policy makers and academic researchers, while private sector is in concern stage to materialise the development: likewise, cambodia is experiencing the rapid development of al in the last decades_ the pool of knowledge in the field is growing fast in way that is unpredictable from user perspective. practically, academia is seen to have challenges in coping with the demand of private sectors in the field. this rapid development and application of the field in industrylservices results in great attentions as well to policy makers government regulator has generally acknowledged the significance of al in economic development;, but privacy, security, ethics, and value are the major concern: after all it is necessary that al landscape in cambodia could be well understood prior to incentivise or regulate the development of the domain: ... scholarly publication from academic point of view cambodia has seen the importance of investment in al development. some nascent publication of al by cambodian scholars seems to be since . for instance, the first algorithm on swarm intelligence published (hul et al,, 2007a; hul et al,, 2007b; seingheng et al.,; tan et al., ). the work was published focusing mainly on water reuselrecycle in industrial sector: however, it seems no much progress in scholarly work; despite that the work 



has great attentional in the later stage. supper power economic drive like china, european union, and united states has started to invest drastically in the research and development of al from that time. the number of peer-reviewed paper and patents on al has increased significantly in the last decade. most of the papers are coming from higher education institutions the number of al publication including journal articles, conference papers, repositories, patents, book chapters, book; thesis, and others are show below. the number of al publication is seen more than two folds in the last ten years: the report by center for security and emerging technology in  appears that journal papers share .%  of all al scholar documents   published: pattern recognition contributed more than other fields of machine learning, computer vision, algorithm, data  mining; natural language processing, human computer interaction, control theory, and linguistics.  .         l               figure . al publication trends in the last ten years (center for security and emerging technology, ) al publication by sector shows that education predominate in the last ten years, while china shares largest number of publication and citation about al. the huge contribution of al knowledge from china could be attributed to large amount of data from users and the government policy to support the al development in the country: in addition, hundreds of companies are opening up on al investment. 



.%, education %  %  % j % .%, unknown ., nonprofit % ., company .%, government             figure . publication by sectors in the last ten years (center for security and emerging technology, ) trends has commonly understood that al-driven technologies are expected to be the stimulus for economic growth. likewise, cambodia values the importance of al application as well. however; adoption, implementation and incentivised system are not sufficient enough  from academic studies in cambodia society (s. heng et al,, ). scholars put an importance debate on value of al on economic development. some suggested that al-enabled technologies for economic development in emerging growth nations could not simply happen until there is proper ecosystem. the foundation to adopt and adapt al technologies for   developing economy   could be scientificlengineering-based education, sufficient infrastructure, favorable technology transfer mechanism; and others (sayogo et al,, ). further investment on al-enabled technologies in education sector was also suggested (p. ). one of the first academic events was conducted entitled st annual forum on al: human intelligence in augmented era' with the aim to promote the field and its application. the event was arranged by institute of technology of cambodia and cambodia development resource institute. then; the forum was not made possible due to disruption of covid-. finally, this important event was continued to commence again entitled ""2nd annual forum: al for society"" on august ,  at cambodia university of technology and  science in collaboration with  ministry of industry, science, technology innovation: this forum is organised to academia; private sectors, government, civil societies, and other relevant stakeholders to discuss the current development of al, its future trends, and opportunities and challenges up ahead that cambodia should prepare itself for if it decides to fully embrace such technology: the forum has five main objectives: provide a platform for the representatives from the government;  industries and academia to discuss; express, and exchange ideas on the al landscape and its impacts on society  heng; bring



raise public awareness of the significance , opportunities; benefits and challenges of al applications formulate policy suggestions and recommendations for promoting and strengthening the development of industry . technologies in general, al in particular promote multi-stakeholder collaboration for knowledge mobilisation and development of artificial intelligence in cambodia disseminate the results of research studies on artificial intelligence landscape in cambodia: ... al demand the application of al is necessarily incorporated in industry and related public services. there is a need in synergising efforts from all stakeholders. an investment in al for research universities is important: on the other hand, the private sector and public institutions could bring actual al- enabled  technologies to fit the demand for research universities: research and innovation ecosystem of al in the countries could be suggested as fellow (s. et al., ). university level: required motived and qualified researchers on al, intra and inter collaboration among researchers and institutions, lessening redundancy work, joint research efforts private sector level: setting up task force, using case-driven approaches, solution- driven adoption process government level: required funding for research and development, clear approaches and strategy, centralisation of the al activities: coordinating underlies foundation the al research and development: existing policy such as national policy on sti -, cambodia's sti roadmap , cambodia digital economy and society policy framework -, could be some of legal instruments to unleash the potential of al for useful purposes. breaking the silo among all stakeholders is the immediate actions to ensure that al ecosystem is connected for socio-economic development of the nation national council of science, technology and innovation is the big umbrella serving as platform to accommodate stakeholders: .. potential al applications for different sectors ... service over the last few decades, the number of internet users increase rapidly over the world wide web. in the current era of internet; large amount of data has been generated every day whenever you are watching tv, using social media, doing online shopping and communication: as the speed of internet access is getting incredibly faster from end-to-end users; the new advance technologies  heng



such as lots, big data analytics, al, have been possibly introduced to better benefit the human life. due to this reason, numerous of companies seek to adopt these advance technologies to create more creative services from day to day to their end user. this process could be possible by collecting and analysing the data generated from the past experience of their customers and, thus, it could deliver the related services according to their interests and needs: let's take a look on how the al technology has the impact on everyday life as following: a retail and e-commerce with the development of the e-commerce, the scale of online retail is becoming larger and larger: within the variety of product categories and changeable customer demand, it is a very big challenge for the sale  volume   prediction: in the modern al is   applied to tackle the aforementioned problems: chen in  proposed an online retail prediction using machine learning called aga-lstm neural network. the adaptive genetic algorithm is applied while the building of neural network to optimised the training time and prediction accuracy. as a result, the method could forecast the sale volume of goods in a very large and complicated e-commerce. b_ online advertising in the world of the digital marketing, many companies try to improve their business strategy by promoting and   diversifying their  products and  services via many methods and one of the promising one is online advertising: the problem is how does the company actually know about which ads the customer is interested in. in fact; al is already there to solve this problem. normally , most of the website have implemented the tracking code to keep log file of browsing behavior of individual (neumann, ). this information is shared across different companies and, thus, the historic behavior about the user interest of which site you visit or which product you looked at were being captured. during this process, al is used to match the users to the corresponding ads based on the analysing of this historic behavior: c customer support customer support is the very effective way used in any company to help the customer when thing goes wrong eg-, when user want to know detail about the way the use the product properly, would call and ask  traditionally, most companies spend a lot of moneys to create customer service department as the prompt and accurate response to a request is very essential for customer retention and satisfaction (molino et al,, ). yet; this procedure could lead to change of worker practices as the users expect to ask for time availability of the information about their orders or to answer a very simple questions such as ""why is my internet connection dead"" (hardalov et al,, ). many of al application have been proposed such as voice recognition , sentimental analysis (kaur, ), etc, in order to understand the customer's question and give  day, they



the accurate response e.g , nowadays, people are most likely to use alexa, siri or google assistance for online shopping; controlling home devices etc. ... manufacturing manufacturing sector has played an important role for the country by contributing to employment growth, national security, sustainable development which improve the economic potential and gdp of the country: with the emerging technologies such as inter-communication (lot, cps), smart visualisation and decision making (al, big data, cloud computing) and cyber security it has enabled the transformation of the manufacturing in terms of the model; approach and its ecosystem. the life cycle of manufacturing in the new era requires a lot of processes and technologies. generally, the procedure uses the autonomous sensing; inter-connection, decision- making, control, and the execution of human; machine, material, and environment information to integrate and optimise various aspects of manufacturing: therefore, it would help to facilitate the production and to produce high efficiency and quality , cost-effective, environment friendly for users, and to improve the competitiveness in the manufacturing market. in addition (qu et al., ) , the evolution of smart manufacturing is not only to develop new technology, but one must also define the requirements of stakeholders and the model of innovative business. technically, this process would help get real-time data to improve the accuracy of decision-making in the supply process (mass customisation) , enhance the efficiency and performance of the production line process (plant automation) , minimise the used resources (raw material) , waste management and increase the overall productivity. al, which is computer system able to perform task that generally mimic to the human intelligence, is one of the main key drivers in this change as it would help in forwarding the sustainable development (buchmeister et al., ). thus, al is a very important factor to transform the traditional manufacturing into advance and smart manufacturing in the context of fourth industrial revolution. a_ smart warehouse management system traditionally; warehouse is used to store the manufactured products from one or many places and deliver them to the company customer. due to the rapid increasing amounts of orders in the modern day, the distribution process in the warehouse is getting more complicated and led to the birth of the smart warehouse management system. according to study there are five main steps in the complete product distribution process which consists in planning, receiving and put away, location management, order picking and packing, and transport and tracking: by introducing al concept, each step can be analysed and optimised separately (zunic et al,, ). study by pulungan et al. in  provides some brief discussions on the practical implementation of artificial intelligent into warehouse management system. the research mentioned on to use new technologies such as bee colony optimisation, fussy controlling, extreme learning machine along the radio frequency identification. all of the aforementioned technologies are used to  flow how



enable the intelligent logistic  system, intelligent warehouse   system, real-time   transportation monitoring system, sales forecasting system and intelligent sales summary system (pulungan et al., ). b_ manufacturing production since the beginning of the industrial revolution . (i4.) , many countries have already address it as modern challenge in various fields   especially in the  advance industrial  manufacturing (kagermann et al, ). this transformation of advanced industrial manufacturing could be made through digitalisation and exploitation of new advanced technology such as self-learning and self-adapting cyber physical system (cps) , lots, cloud computing and al. their primary goal is to address the need of modern production system with higher  efficiency and lower cost throughout the process so that it could meet new demand in the modern market: to tackle the problems, numerous of enterprises have already investigated and implemented by using all of these aforementioned technologies. to be competitive under the paradigm of |., a company must production planning and control (ppc) able to respond to disturbance (cadavid et al,, ). normally, ppc can be defined as the required quantity in the plant production to meet profitability, productivity and on-time delivery: to satisfy the requirement; the author introduce the al technology by using text mining to estimate the production inhibition time and machine learning techniques to create the dynamic production schedule in the production line. on the other hand, the aim of smart manufacturing is to achieve highly flexible and automate in the production process (hsieh et al,, ). the use case of the paper is to detect the anomaly of production line in smart manufacturing by using the collected data from the sensing device: they introduce a new al algorithm called unsupervised real-time anomaly detection based on lstm-based auto- encoder . ... mobility and transportation mobility and transportation are known as the backbones of the modern economy and function in one country to become intelligent: they are a driven force to promote economic growth, enhance the accessibility of the labor market; strengthen the logistics supply chain, and open up new markets for enterprises due to their linkages to other sectors. according to the japan international cooperation agency report on the modernisation of vehicle registration in , the number of registered vehicles and motorcycles has increased exponentially. the growth rate in  was approximately %. this growth leads to primary emissions, then the smart moves of the mobility and transportation sector must be required to achieve environmental sustainability and a new mobility ecosystem. 



new mobility and transportation technologies currently take al as the significant perspective, transforming conventional transportation into intelligent transportation the potential al applications on mobility and transportation can be enabled as follows, a_ advanced driver assistance   systems and automated driving  systems: this autonomous technology can enable vehicles, trains, roads, and other infrastructure to communicate with computers, smartphones, or other devices via wireless technologies al capabilities can help increase safety, reliability, and hauling efficiency. for example, autonomous driving systems are designed to offer drivers some functions such as monitoring;  warning;  braking, and  steering  functions: the potential of al can be analysed to predict the end ofthe queue to generate a queue warning message to allow the vehicle to take action: b cybersecurity: al is built in cybersecurity to   provide high security of technologies applied in modern transportation to achieve   efficient operations and prevent any thread interruption. precisely, those automated systems that connected vehicles,  devices, and infrastructure operating together are needed to embed al technology to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the systems by identifying the threadslmalware, preventing the damage resources c accessible transportation: this system uses al to support all travelers, including the elderly or people with disabilities the system consists of many target functions related to transportation, such as pre-trip planning, wayfinding and navigation, surface street crossing, and navigating the complex road. in addition, the auto curb ramp system is also installed in the vehicle or other transportation as an assistant to help the disabled and older adults. al can also promote reliability and safety execute one travel to all links in the travel chain to make it easy for users to access: d_ traveler decision  support tools: the   potential al-enabled   applications   provide adequate   monitoring information to process passenger  requests   (weatherlpricing information) , predict the roadway; arrival times, and other valuable functions such as planning trips: for instance, the transportation system managers can also use the information in the system to support decision-making: transportation systems management and operations: the optimisation of multimodal infrastructure systems using al is built to perform real-time and dynamic service   systems to improve the  transportation   system. decision-making is also considered in this management system to control the work zone, traffic incident, road weather , or other traffic signals:  cyber



f . commercial vehicle and freight  operations: al is embedded to address the operation and movement of vehicle and freight management systems. for example, al is applied in asset tracking, cargo status monitoring, freight optimisation, freight signals, etc , to ensure management efficiency and safety: g transit   operations and management: this   system uses al to perform the management;  operations, maintenance, and security to respond to many services, including maintenance forecasting; event detection, dynamic itinerary planning, and service allocation: this system helps the user monitor and select the service to apply for transit vehicles: h_ emergency management: this is a particular system that uses al to build the alert agency system to address public transportation safety management: the system covers the necessary alerts, such as policies, fire, and emergency medical. air traffic management: to optimise air traffic pathway management, al needs to use the available data to generalise the pathway and provide real-time visualisation of the traffic management system. j remote sensing: drone and uncrewed aerial vehicles have functioned as intelligent remote sensing; which uses al to monitor and control the traffic, bridge inspections, aerial mapping; incident management, and transportation infrastructure. k_ asset management and roadway construction and maintenance: this system focus on the strategic and systematic process of operating, maintaining, and improving physical assets by using al application. the prediction of al can identify a structured sequence of maintenance, preservation, rehabilitation; and replacement actions that requires taking action at a minimum feasible cost. in summary; there are four system functions enabled by al in the mobility and transportation sector: sense and perceive the environment reason and analyse information learn from the experience and adapt to new situations make decisions, communicate, and take actions. the al-enable application is checked with four maturity levels: concept; randd, prototype or minimum viable product; and production. consequently, there are three aspects of al-enabled application: the increased levels of comfort and convenience 



the prospect of vastly improved safety through autonomous driving the macro benefits to the environment (e.g;, potential reduction of emissions) and society (e.g , potential optimisation of traffic less required parking space in city centers)  ... agriculture the agricultural sector is one of cambodia's  roadmap priorities for technology development options. besides, agriculture had gained  percent of cambodias gdp and employed about  million people in , according to a report by the us embassy in cambodia: currently, agriculture technology has rapidly transformed to use advanced machinery and internet of thing technology to analyse and enhance production efficiency. the potential al applications in the agriculture sector can provide into six categories: a agricultural production management: al is enabled in the agricultural production management system to provide information about crop rotation planning, planting time consumption, water and nutrient management; pests and fertilisers and management, disease control, optimal harvest; food marketing; product distribution; food safety, and food supply chain tasks b agricultural production management: al is enabled in the agricultural production management system to provide information about crop rotation planning, planting time consumption, water and nutrient management; pests and fertilisers and management, disease control, optimal harvest; food marketing, product distribution, food safety, and food supply chain tasks c crop monitoring: this system applies al to monitor and identify crop health issues, soil nutrients, weather conditions, irrigation, and other functions that maximise crop revenue. the al-enabled application provides visual instruction and quickly understands soil health, plant pests, and plant disease d_ data science: the agriculture information is stored at all data points every day for further analysis: for example, weather conditions, temperature, irrigation, and soil conditions data are collected from the farm to enable an al model to predict the plant condition whether it will produce high quality or not. real-time data provides a better understanding of the health of plants and optimise natural resources. this approach produces agroecosystem dynamics under changing environmental conditions disease detection: the al-enabled tool is applied to provide the early-warning system to prevent disease outbreaks and spotting insectslanimals in the area of plants al can also trigger the sensor to take action to protect the plant  flow,



f . food quality: food safety and quality assurance use al as a critical role to perform most human tasks to check the plant g predictive analytics: potential al application is performed as data analysis to help farmers protect the land quality , reduce water irrigation, and determine the amount of crop harvested: the prediction is expected to increase the profitability for each field while reducing the environmental impact of pesticides and fertiliser in summary, al will drive the agricultural revolution to an intelligent agricultural ecosystem and sustainability. ... education throughout the ages, countries have seen the profound impact of education on their quality of life (psacharopoulos and patrinos ). with that in mind, nothing could be more transformative than providing consistent  high-quality education across cambodia's population. and these promising advancements are actually more possible than ever through the use of artificial intelligence with its adaptive algorithms as a matter of fact; this new technology is already being used in many classrooms around the world and online to help facilitate learning through virtual and individualised educational platforms: and given how respected teachers currently are in cambodia; improving teachers' impact has become a top priority for cambodian leadership. after all, today's students will become tomorrow's leaders that will advance cambodia's future. cambodian culture values hard work; dedication, and family all of which make for students that are capable of many amasing accomplishments. however; given the financial, geographic, and demographic constraints, providing quality education has been a challenge. that being said, ai and its direct application to facilitate learning has the potential to transform cambodia's education system and substantially raise the quality of life for millions of citizens. in the future, this technology will facilitate the implementation of standardised learning in which the lessons for each student will be based on their capabilities and hard work, not on the limitations of their geographic situation: but delivering on these promises requires focused planning and execution by the leadership of cambodia: currently; however, al in education is far from the  envisioned science fiction avatar that seamlessly interacts with young students. as things are now, al remains in the nascent stages of development: still, many scholars believe that there will be   comprehensive educational applications that work  directly with students. these applications will   understand what each student needs; providing lessons that focus on what exactly the student must focus on to reach the next educational milestone.  the



far before the previously mentioned avatar begins teaching our children, educators will be relying on al to facilitate the traditional classroom setting: in fact, most current applications of al in the classroom help teachers understand where students need specialised lessons or individualised training: al is  helping teachers build smart content; automate   tutoring, grade tests, and categorise learning difficulties: this saves time for the teachers, allowing them to focus on the more substantial aspects of teaching such as lesson planning and student engagement (e.g: al in education) (faggella; ). modern examples of al in education have emerged in countries all over the world. one notable example is china's initiative called education informatisation . digital first education:' one of the first initiatives in this program was to upgrade the curriculum by improving the availability of resources for teachers. to this end, they built a ""shared resource"" platform which makes teachers more productive by providing a well organised digital space for resources that have been collected from all over the country (e.g: education informatisation . in china: motivation, framework, and vision, an exploration into innovative practices of targeted poverty reduction through education using information technology) (yan and yang; ). artificial intelligence will have a similar impact on most other industries as well. additionally, the technology itself is an industry that will provide many opportunities for students that are capable of learning how to use these new tools. some examples include deep learning; statistical analysis; and robotics. cambodian students will undoubtedly have a distinct advantage in using these new technologies: this will in turn help  cambodia realise the educational   promise of   artificial intelligence. ... finance and trade cambodia's gdp growth rate has been extremely stable over time and is now the sixth fastest growing economy in the world: what is unique about this growth is that it has been steady for over  years (see gdp chart): the world economic forum has reported that only  economies worldwide have provided this level of stable growth. this is a sign of resilience and consistency in the country: it is also a sign that cambodia has the discipline and drive to implement new solutions and technological innovations regularly. and artificial intelligence will be yet another solution that helps cambodia thrive in the future (world economic forum, ).  many

cambodia thrive in already fertile markets such as the usa, china, and germany as shown in figure above. al provides many opportunities for efficiency and growth in the world market: for example, the implementation of al for language translation in e-commerce has been shown to produce more than % growth in online international trade sales (brynjolfsson et al., ). and there are other such examples in which al tools are capable of managing compliance despite the numerous complexities between suppliers, clients , and   shifting trade restrictions: without al, many industries rely on mere human intervention to constantly check for errors however; by using al, the system can learn how to handle these problems more efficiently and accurately, which in turn allows for a more seamless compliance operation. united belgium vietnam united states china kingdom .% .% ./.% netherlands | thailand spain |france japan .% .%|.%|.%/ .% south: . canada italy .% .% .% hong kong incia russia . united _ germany .% poland ireland % australia . gabon .% singapore  figure . cambodia export by contry al is also making a significant contribution by optimising the supply chain: the significant lead time required for many supply operations can derail trade operations by causing a myriad of time delays, especially when there are complex multipart orders. the ordering of one part might mean the ordering of sixty different other parts, all with different lead times. getting ahead of these orders is to delivering your products on time: similarly  significant capability of this technology is the implementation of al based  smart contracts. this is where the legal contract is essentially broken down into computer code in which business rules are implemented, which then allows al to avoid any costly mistakes while reducing manual checking: these factors all lead to easier access to trade and financing because the business investors are more confident in a process that they can measure and trust: as more countries continue to implement al for international trade, the compatibility of such technology across different countries would mean better communication, efficiency, and fairness in international dealings. for example, a smaller country might feel more comfortable in a deal in  key



which all of its factors are being considered and intentionally maximised in discussions with larger countries that have more resources. and wealthier countries will have the chance to better international relations and improve the quality of life in smaller countries with al handling the nuances for both sides the overall benefits of implementing al in negotiations are that each side can move faster; have deeper confidence, and feel more comfortable with the outcomes the is having a system that each party can trust and that can illuminate alternatives that might have otherwise been unthought of by both sides (hone, ). this is how al becomes sewn into the fabric of international trade. and while it does not completely replace the process or the people, it is still implemented in almost every component, delivering an improved trading operation: these improvements will be realised right to the bottom line in cambodia, thereby driving the gdp to even higher levels (nesbitt; )_ ... healthcare and medicine healthcare is one of the most important areas for the use of al. cambodia has already begun working with companies that utilise various levels of diagnostic technologies embedded with al. for example, cara has tools that help   diagnose eye and cardiovascular disease in cambodia: this is just the beginning: artificial intelligence has the capability for use in almost every area of healthcare from diagnostics, surgery, operational  efficiencies, and population disease projection analytics (davenport and kalakota, ). future opportunities include smart hospitals where equipment and infrastructure are embedded with contact sensors that bring a hospital's architecture to a level of ambient intelligence. these tools have provided new levels of protection for clinical professionals and safety for patients by interpreting their surroundings and gathering additional relevant data for clinicians (standford university, ). the development of such artificial intelligence in healthcare has undergone many evolutions: in the early 80s, logic systems consisting of  if-then-else statements and massive rules-base engineering were defined as a type of intelligence: however, diagnostic professionals found these tools to be overwhelmingly complex and difficult to manage. one of the primary challenges was keeping the current knowledge base up-to-date, especially if the recommendation engine was providing dosage calculations: also, rule engines typically consisted of hundreds and thousands of statements, all of which were largely error-prone and hardly classifiable in today's modern ai engines (davenport and kalakota; ). (the potential for artificial intelligence in healthcare) most of today's al technology is based on neural networks and deep learning: such technology allows machines to perform tasks without specifically being programmed to do so. in this way, computers can learn from data and perform tasks in a more human-friendly way: aii kinds of problems are being efficiently handled by al in the medical field. for instance, the massive amount of data doctors has to analyse when diagnosing a patient is typically colossal.  key



health records are spread across multiple systems and do not follow any standard protocol. but al tools bring all of the data together; then these tools analyse the structured and unstructured results to produce probabilistic diagnostics that can help the doctor quickly identify a potential illness: in addition to   diagnostics, artificial intelligence is also becoming common in treatment recommendations and avoiding medical errors with the massive amount of data available each year, it is difficult or impossible for all clinical professionals to be up-to-date on the potential treatment   regimens for uncommon diagnoses. an  empirical explaining this medical challenge has been done using modern machine-learning algorithms in the cambodian children's hospital (oonsivilai et al,,). this study focused on the patient's antibiotic susceptibility based on patient-specific predictions. the result from the study outperformed the logistic regression models and has proved itself to be very beneficial when it comes to issuing prescriptions since it can prevent the inappropriate overuse of antibiotics, thereby reducing the patient's resistance to antibiotic treatment: every year more medical articles are produced than could ever be read by one person. in  nearly  million scientific articles were published, and that trend has grown % every year (chi; ). furthermore, it has been well documented that patient allergy management; dangerous drug-to-drug interactions, and dealing with other complex medical conditions have yielded a risky environment for patients but al tools can quickly digest the latest articles and recalculate potential treatment plans almost instantaneously: this helps safeguard patients by providing clinicians with focused, uncluttered   information. al is also being used to help clinical professionals more accurately and effectively identify medical treatments with the best probability of success: for example, ibm watson reads the patient's medical record and then determines the likelihood of a stroke, it then provides the potential success of a variety of different treatments (ibm, ). surgical robots have also been assisting clinicians for decades: but recently these robots are being embedded with ai: this is largely seen in common surgeries such as gynecologic and prostate procedures. such technology helps the surgeon focus on more complex matters while removing much of the basic logistics of the operation (davenport and kalakota, ). surgeons are also using al to help keep track of all the relevant factors in their decision-making: these factors include the values and emotions of the patient, case complexity, individual judgment; and time constraints. bringing al tools into the surgical decision-making process helps clarify all the factors of these decisions within an objective framework: patients thereby end up with a better outcome when both human and automated decision-making come together over their surgical procedures (loftus et al,, ).  study



.. challenges al is currently used extensively in commercial applications like targeting advertisements, search optimisation, customer service, healthcare, transportation, and the robotic applications that have been previously explained in this article. the basic technological principles for implementing these systems have been around for decades, but the computational power and clean data necessary to implement these ideas have only recently become feasible. the most promising aspect of this implementation is supervised learning: this provides the foundation for many of the most practical examples of al in business (mckinsey global institute, ). however, there are many challenges and concerns that come with the use of al. certainly, machine learning requires massive amounts of data and computing time. researchers are generally challenged when it comes to finding high-quality, unbiased training sets to teach ai. in many cases, hundreds of thousands, if not millions of records are required to properly implement deep learning algorithms. and data sets containing biased information can lead to undesirable results: most algorithms and data sets need to be tuned to the appropriate objective and all algorithms need to be tested to make sure the results are correct and appropriate. every effort should be made for data to be stored in a usable format and be well documented so it can be appropriately applied in a learning model. data manipulation alone is one of the most expensive and time- consuming parts of any al project. there are other cultural challenges to consider that branch out into new issues for leadership when it comes to incorporating al. a cautious yet experimental mindset is necessary for this new technology enterprise to be successful. errors are natural and even helpful for our understanding: although sometimes the cost in time and money might increase, it should still be considered a milestone for progress governments and companies hoping to use al also need to focus on innovation, critical thinking, and stem in their educational system: external subject matter experts will certainly be able to help with data formatting and processing algorithms: however , experts who understand the underlying data and principles of how the information might be best used are in a position to maximise the impact and profitability of this new technology (mackinsey global institute , )_ in addition to the challenges faced by leadership, data quality, and bias, is also held back by computing power and infrastructure: specifically, al implementation is hampered by the lack of available talent and intellectually skilled practitioners, not to mention financing: in many areas funding is not available to test applications or even to provide the time to consider how these new solutions might be applied. in the short term, this research takes time and money. but in the run; the potential benefits will far outweigh the investment (mackinsey global institute, ).  key ai long



there has been much written about how al will take jobs away from unskilled or easily automated workers. this can especially be seen in cambodia where industries are still labor intensive (an; ) and have low economy-of-scale in terms of market size. this means that most of these industries would not allow cambodian businesses to afford advanced automated and robotic machines that are made available by al technology: this typically leads to hesitation to invest and experiment with al: however; al brings other opportunities, especially in the early stages of transition: one example in education involves the potential confusion between the student and the al program's design: the implementation of al based learning systems in china; for example, required the hiring of hundreds of ""tutors"" to help students during the implementation of their lessons: and % of these positions were filled by women who would have otherwise gone unemployed (xinxin et al,, ). the transition to al for a country or a company will not be simple and seamless: there are and will be advances in some areas and challenges in others the foundation of al demands hard work in infrastructure and normal information; as well as communication technology (ict): but cambodia has already been implementing a plan to fortify these fundamental infrastructure components (sean and lor, ). there have been many famous examples that show how al can make errors and provide misleading answers during this transition. one famous example is google's ""gfe, which is short for ""google flu trends:' it was an experimental tool that was intended to predict flu outbreaks in the united states. initial results seemed promising; but unfortunately, it was determined that the data was unreliable in its predictions and the project was terminated: other examples include the microsoft chat bot that was making sexist and racist statements. it was shut down within  hours of operation: there was also the amazon al hiring blunder where selections that had been in use for years were clearly biased: none of these errors negate the fact that al is a powerful technology that is here to stay. improvements in the algorithms and data sets will undoubtedly drive positive performance in the future (tennery and cherelus, ). healthcare diagnostics and procedural processes with al have also been successfully deployed: however, widespread use of al to displace caregivers is unlikely in the short-term, and perhaps in the long term. this is because of the tremendous shortage in clinical professionals in cambodia and around the world. additionally, al is seen as a diagnostic helper, but will probably never be a tool to deliver a diagnosis. patients tend to prefer face-to-face dialogue around their diagnoses and potential treatment options. therefore; although al can be extremely helpful and even necessary to ease the burden of clinical diagnostics, it will not be a replacement (davenport kalakota; ). in many situations; the output and associated logical explanation of al has not been made clear: for example, educational al has been struggling to build models that allow students to learn in  also,



steps: it has been well documented that  porting curriculum content into usable al-based frameworks is challenging and expensive. also, identifying laddering technologies that serve to identify students' level of understanding has additional complexities. for example, a student that understands to do addition but  struggles with   multiplication naturally needs   specific, individualised attention in multiplication. this requires lessons to be linked in a sophisticated manner that is machine readable and integrated across curriculums: implementing a 'knowledge tree' for such students involves an efficient network of lessons that require advanced skills, an in-depth knowledge of databases, and a solid understanding of the interplay within such systems to see how the al model will respond to the sum total of its overall usage. fortunately, there are many working examples of well planned and executed al based learning engines. one example is the system implemented in china to help non-native speakers learn mandarin. the system has an al-based engine that engages the students and determines their level of   comprehension. then it continuously adjusts their   experience to maximise understanding: students using this system have shown significantly improved test results (xinxin et al,,). cybersecurity and   confidentiality are also major challenges for al, particularly when the information is clinical or financially related: the implementation of al also raises confidentiality and intellectual property (ip) issues. training data often needs to be copied and edited for use, which may lead to a certain degree of vulnerability: with that in mind, cybersecurity should be a completely integral part of every al project in order to properly consider the necessary protocols for  safety, security , and protecting intellectual property, as well as safeguarding  personal information. regular testing and audits are required to ensure a safe and secure environment: furthermore, proper data governance, threat detection, and legal review should be fundamental to any technological project (oseni et al,, ). in cambodia; this technology is not just about al. it is about creating a digital framework within the existing infrastructure to implement its learning capability  alongside the work of information and communication technology (ict). a relevant legal  framework on data and cybersecurity is also needed to be in force to combat cybercrimes and to also provide assurance to relevant businesses, practitioners, and consumers in the field: infrastructure is the and there is already a basic technological foundation that cambodia has been building for years that will be leveraged to maximise the impact of al in education (sean and lor, ). recently, the royal government of cambodia has put forth in its cambodia digital economy and society policy framework - specific measures within the short and medium term of its plan to boost investment in infrastructure and the application of al in data governance, particularly in data use and analysis (royal government  of cambodia, ). however , to effectively use al, an environment of experimentation and  innovation is necessary: basic  how key;



research and prototyping are required. but proper leadership and guidance for such objectives are also necessary to purposely direct this technology in a way that solves real problems for cambodia: technological projects have suffered from weak leadership and misguided objectives: but constant measurement, objective evaluation, and experimenting with potential solutions are necessary in avoiding such issues: the current reality of al is undoubtedly promising: and the truth is that al is already producing positive results that are used daily in business, clinical, and mechanical settings far from magic, the   technology is math-intensive and   requires highly skilled   professionals for planning; implementation, assessment;, and continuous monitoring/teedback to ensure appropriate results. and while the initial stages of development are error-prone, the daily use of successfully implemented al platforms is simple and extremely reliable. even now, al continues to prove its worth despite the challenges of its development: but that being said, the most important key to its success is good leadership that realises the undeniable benefits al has in store for cambodia. 6_ al for cambodia: policy framework and options artificial intelligence (al) is one of the essential technologies in the world game changing in every sector to improve productivity, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. in order to foster trustworthy al ecosystems, it is essential for countries to develop human-centered policies that promote socio- economic and responsible al research and development: this includes policies that encourage investment in such initiatives: these policies of al development should take into account its national development vision as well as regional and global trends: the country's objectives; preferences, and overarching strategy for al advancement in both immediate and distant future should be clarified. initially, the main objective is to cultivate skilled personnel and employ al solutions to deal with critical national focus areas that will have a swift impact on cambodia's socio-economic  status_ over  time , the priority should shift  to developing  fundamental and advanced research; promoting high-level al research and innovation, and   establishing cambodia's standing in advanced technology on a global scale to reach this goal, here are some policy recommendations for cambodia: . . define national focus areas cambodia has experienced a significant increase in internet users as part of its pursuit to become digital nation. these users employ the internet for various reasons such as entertainment; work, and business growth. consequently, innovative technologies like lots, big data analytics, and ai are increasingly becoming prevalent in cambodia's daily activities. to maximize this technological advancement; cambodia should prioritize the utilization of al in developmental sectors: these sectors should be carefully selected to ensure that they align with the country's overall development goals. the recommendations areas should include:  many key key



service for sme: with the rapid growth of internet users, many businesses are eager to adopt advanced technologies that can enhance customer experiences and drive business growth. one way to achieve this is by collecting and analyzing data from customers' past experiences, which can help companies deliver  relevant  services based on their preferences and needs to leverage these technologies effectively, the policies should focus on areas such as retail and e-commerce, online advertising; and customer support manufacturing: the of cambodia's gdp has been significantly influenced by its manufacturing sector. to further enhance productivity and cost-effectiveness in manufacturing and keep up with the fourth industrial revolution; implementation of al can help transform traditional manufacturing into advanced and smart manufacturing: this, in turn; will enable cambodia to compete effectively in regional and global markets, leading to positive socio-economic progress: the integration of   technology in manufacturing can involve real-time data collection through lot, automation processes using robotics, and improved daily operations and decision-making through information systems and ai: mobility and transportation: transportation and mobility is a significant factor in stimulating economic growth, improving market accessibility, strengthening logistics supply chains, and creating new opportunities for businesses by connecting different sectors. introducing al to improve the efficiency and accessibility of transportation and mobility can aid cambodia in achieving its environmental sustainability, road safety, and socio-economic  objectives. to effectively implement al in transportation, it is crucial to focus on improving transport   accessibility, management and  operation systems, emergency response management; security measures, and roadway maintenance and management agriculture: in , agriculture contributed % to cambodia's gdp and provided employment opportunities to around  million individuals. with the advancements in technology, the agricultural sector has rapidly evolved and incorporated sophisticated machinery and internet of things technology to enhance production efficiency. given that cambodia is primarily an agricultural-based country, the implementation of al for enhancing agricultural productivity is imperative: the potential applications of al in agriculture include managing production; monitoring crop growth, analyzing data and making informed decisions, detecting diseases, monitoring food quality and safety, and conducting predictive analysis. education: providing consistent; high-quality education to its citizens will a significant impact on both people's lifestyles, well-being and the country's economic growth. in today's digital age, al and other technologies have revolutionized the way we teach and learn. despite potential challenges, these applications offer immense  key growth bring



benefits for transforming education. however, since technology accessibility is still limited in some regions of cambodia due to socio-economic and geographic factors: therefore , to maximize the of al in education requires improving three main strategies: ) improve digital infrastructure and funding to accessibility to technology for   every student; ) providing clear national   policies and guidelines on the implementation of al in teaching and learning activities, and ) using technology to make learning contents accessible to all students regardless of their location. finance and trade: in order for cambodia's economy to continue its growth trajectory, it is   crucial that the financial sector keeps facilitating investment   flow while also supporting domestic credits. the country's sustained development in terms of gdp growth can be attributed to trade; which plays a significant role in boosting the economy: therefore, enhancing trade is directly linked to improving the overall economy of cambodia. in this context; leveraging the potential of artificial intelligence can prove to be advantageous in terms of enhancing finance, trade and maintaining competitiveness in the global market of the future al tools can be implemented in finance and trend analysis to enhance various aspects of businesses such as international trade through automatic  language   translation,  ensuring compliance with regulations, providing efficient customer support, creating customer profiles for targeted marketing; optimizing the supply chain management; and executing smart contracts. healthcare: access to high-quality healthcare is crucial for the overall well-being and development of a country, and it should be a top priority in every nation's development goals. artificial intelligence (al) is playing an increasingly important role in healthcare worldwide, and cambodia is already working with companies that use al-powered diagnostic technologies the potential applications of al in healthcare are vast, from diagnostics and surgery to operational efficiencies and population disease projection analytics and   prediction: to  prevent medical errors, cambodia should consider implementing smart hospitals where   technology is integrated into equipment; infrastructure, and processes to enhance diagnosis and treatment  tourism: tourism is a significant contributor to cambodia's economy; with around . million domestic and . million international tourists visiting in  prior to the covid-  pandemic. however; in , only . million international visitors were recorded, highlighting the impact of the pandemic on travel: therefore, it has become essential to utilize technology as a means to enhance tourism activities and help the industry recover. .. develop a national al regulation and guidelines al has the potential to bring numerous benefits to society and the economy, but it also carries significant risks and responsibilities, particularly regarding privacy, ethics, and security.  profit



to ensure that al applications prioritize human-centered benefits, cambodia must develop regulations and guidelines by a multi-ministries committee: the committee shall consist  of the ministry of industry,  science ,  technology and innovation; ministry of post and telecommunication and ministry of education, youth and sport: this new regulation and guidelines require harmonizing existing laws and creating new data protection laws that govern sensitive personal information throughout its lifecycle, from capture to storage, sharing, use, and archiving: to safeguard citizens' privacy, organizations of all sizes including academia should adopt a privacy-by-design approach to developing al applicationslalgorithms the multi-ministries committee should also oversee the proper incorporation of ethics and privacy measures in al development to ensure compliance with best practices .. develop a national al infrastructure in order for al to be fully utilized, it is crucial to have a strong infrastructure that supports the development and implementation of al systems  this infrastructure should be initiated by the government with the support from private industries and academia. this infrastructure shall be used to support students, researchers, universities, and industries in their pursuit of al innovation: it shall consider various components such as hardware, software, data, and human resources that are necessary for the research and deployment of al solutions: essential components of this infrastructure may include high-performance computing systems, cloud-based platforms for data storage and processing, and open-source ai frameworks and libraries: .. promote in al research, innovation, education and talent development the future is expected to see the integration of emerging technologies such as big data, cloud computing; cyber security, data science, al, robotics, 3d printing; blockchain, and internet of things (lots) across various industries  including  businesses, healthcare,  agriculture, and education: talent and skill development: cambodia faces a shortage of highly skilled workers in these areas, which highlights the need for educational reforms to equip students with modern skill sets that align with the demands of the future labor market: in addition, one of draw-back when using al is job displacement to tackle this challenge, the government can prioritize and support talent and skill development initiatives. these could be: 



ministry of education, youth and sport shall encourage educational institutions to provide specialize course for talent and skill development ministry of economics shall allocate skill development budget to support such initiatives companies can invest in training their workers with the necessary skills educational institutions can play the role of trainer to provide necessary training to companies developing al research culture: for sustainable benefits and human capital development, cambodia should also encourage al research and innovation activities. this may include: ministry of education, youth and sport shall provide incentives and fund for al research and innovation this incentive and fund shall be classified into  categories: research fundamental: to support initiatives of researchers and academia innovation   research: to support   applied research that are potential  for commercialization. this research shall be the cooperation between educational institutions and industries flagship project: to support long-term and impactful research projects. this kind of project shall consist of educational institutions, industrial and international organizations: .. develop ai ecosystem to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth, cambodia's development strategy should prioritize investing more in al research; innovation, and entrepreneurship. this can be accomplished by: creating an al ecosystem that fosters collaboration beyond just cooperation among stakeholders: use the quadruple helix paradigm to involves academics, government, industrial and societies to ensure social equality , minimize perpetuate biases and pose privacy risks develop a national strategy to encourage business collaboration: this may include: the ministry of economic shall consider funding budgets to support public-private partnerships research and innovation; knowledge transfer and commercialization on applied-al projects. governments should also consider policies such as tax reductions or incentives for industries investing in al research and innovation: such policies will encourage industry to invest in research and development; build innovative applications, and generate job opportunities 



encourage collaboration between industry and educational institutions. academia can contribute research expertise, train talent, and facilitate knowledge transfer to industry .. foster international collaborations global collaboration and swift policy actions are essential in the market-driven field of al. for cambodia to remain competitive on the stage, it is crucial to cultivate world-class talent through various strategies: the first step is to identify skill gaps in education, research, and innovation. then, offer attractive scholarships and incentives for cambodian individuals to study abroad and fill these gaps. the scholarship source can be funding by government through budget planning organized by ministry of education, youth and sport industry funding international cooperation and co-funding secondly; cambodia needs to establish its own research platform to  facilitate knowledge sharing and promote research activities amongst cambodian researchers, ultimately improving the quality of research in the country and creating opportunities for international partnerships: lastly, implementing a special   grant package that encourages regional and international collaboration will help to advance al research and innovation in cambodia and elevate cambodia's research quality to an international level.  global

model artificial intelligence governance framework  . preamble



 . the model framework focuses primarily on four broad areas: internal governance structures and measures, human involvement in al-augmented decision-making, operations management and stakeholder interaction and communication. while the model framework is certainly not limited in ambition, it is ultimately limited by form, purpose and practical considerations of scope. with that in mind, several caveats bear mentioning: the model framework is a  algorithm-agnostic it does not focus on al or data analytics methodology: it applies to the design, application and use of al in general. b. technology-agnostic it does not focus on systems, software or technology and will apply regardless of development language and data storage method: sector-agnostic it serves as a baseline set of considerations and measures for organisations operating in any sector to adopt: specific sectors or organisations may choose to include additional considerations and measures or adapt this baseline set to meet their needs. the pdpc encourages and will collaborate with agencies adapting the model framework for their sectors. d. scale- and business-model-agnostic it does not focus on organisations of a particular scale or size. it can also be used by organisations engaging in business-to-business or business-to-consumer activities and operations, or in any other business model. specific specific public



model artificial intelligence governance framework  . it is recognised that there are a number of issues that are closely interrelated to the ethical use and deployment of al. this model framework does not focus on these specific issues, which are often sufficient in scope to warrant separate study and treatment: examples of these issues include: a articulating a new set of ethical principles for ai. there are already a number of  attempts   globally in establishing a universal set of principles. while a consistent core set of ethical principles is emerging, there is also a penumbra of variation across cultures, jurisdictions and industry sectors. the model framework uses existing and common al ethical principles (a compilation of which is set out in annex a) and converts them into implementable practices. b. providing model frameworks and addressing issues around data sharing, whether between the and private sectors or between  organisations or within consortia. there are a number of guides that are relevant, such as the imda's trusted data sharing framework and the guide to data valuation for data sharing: discussing issues   relating to the legal liabilities associated with al, intellectual property rights, and societal impacts of al on employment; competition, unequal access to al products and services by different segments of society, al technologies falling into hands of wrong people) , etc: these issues are nevertheless pertinent and can be separately through platforms such as the centre for al and data governance established in the singapore management university school of law: public (e.g: explored



 . introduction



model artificial intelligence governance framework  objectives . the exponential growth in data and computing power has fuelled the advancement of data-driven technologies such as ai. al can be used by organisations to provide new and services, boost productivity, enhance competitiveness, ultimately leading to economic growth and a better quality of life. as with any new technology, however; al also introduces new ethical, legal and governance   challenges: these include risks of unintended discrimination potentially leading to unfair outcomes, as well as issues relating to consumers' knowledge abouthow al is involved in making significant or sensitive decisions about them: . the pdpc,' with advice from the advisory council, proposes this second edition of the and voluntary model framework as a general, ready-to-use tool to enable organisations that are deploying al solutions at scale to do so in a responsible manner this model framework is not intended for organisations that are deploying updated commercial off-the-shelf software packages that happen to now incorporate al in their feature set: . this voluntary model framework provides guidance on the issues to be considered and measures that can be implemented. adopting this model framework will require tailoring the measures to address the risks identified for the implementing organisation. the model framework is intended to assist organisations to achieve the following objectives: a_ build stakeholder confidence in al through organisations'  responsible use of al to manage different risks in al deployment b_ demonstrate   reasonable efforts to align internal policies, structures and processes with relevant accountability-based practices in data management and protection (e.g: the personal data protection act  (""pdpa"") and the oecd privacy principles). under section  of singapore's personal data protection act ,the imda is designated as the pdpc: goods living key



 . to assist organisations in implementing the model framework, the pdpc has also prepared a complementary isago. the isago helps organisations assess the alignment of their al governance practices and processes with the model framework: it also provides additional useful industry references and examples that further clarify the recommendations set out in this model framework . the extent to which organisations adopt the recommendations in this model framework depends on several factors, including the nature and complexity of the al used by organisations, the extent to which al is employed in the organisations' decision- making, and the severity and probability of the impact of the autonomous decision on individuals. . to elaborate: al technologies may be used to augment a human decision-maker or to autonomously make a decision for instance, the impact of an autonomous decision in medical diagnosis is arguably greater than that in a product recommendation: the commercial risks of al deployment is therefore proportionate to the impact on individuals. generally, where the cost of implementing al technologies in an ethical manner outweighs the expected benefits, organisations should consider whether alternative non-alsolutions should be adopted: the considerations and recommendations set out in this framework are intended to guide   organisations that have decided to deploy ai technologies at scale.



model artificial intelligence governance framework  guiding principles . the model framework is based on two high-level  guiding principles that promote trust in al and understanding ofthe use of al technologies: a organisations al in decision-making should ensure thatthe decision-making process is explainable , transparent and fair. although perfect  explainability,  transparency and fairness are impossible to attain, organisations should strive to ensure that their use or application of al is undertaken in a manner that reflects the objectives of these principles as far as possible. this helps build trust and confidence in ai: b. al solutions should be human-centric. as al is used to amplify human capabilities, the protection ofthe interests of human beings, including their well-being and should be the primary considerations in the  design, development and deployment of ai: organisations should ensure that al decision-making processes are explainable, transparent and fair while al solutions should be human-centric: using safety,



 . like other technologies, al aims to increase human productivity: however; unlike earlier technologies, some aspects of autonomous predictions or decisions made by al may not be fully explainable: as al technologies can make decisions that affect individuals, or have a significant impact on society, markets or economies, organisations should consider this model framework to their deployment of ai. . organisations should detail a set of ethical principles when embark on deployment of al at scale within their processes or to empower their products and/or services. where necessary, organisations may wish to refer to the compilation of al ethical principles in annex a: as far as possible, organisations should also review their existing corporate values and incorporate the ethical principles that have articulated: some of the ethical principles (e.g: safety) may be articulated as risks that can be incorporated into the corporate risk management framework the model framework is designed to assist organisations incorporating ethical principles into familiar and pre-existing corporate governance structures, and thereby aid in guiding the adoption of al in an organisation: using guide they they by



model artificial intelligence governance framework  assumptions . the model framework aims to discuss good data management practices in general. the model framework is mainly applicable to machine learning models (as compared to pure decision tree-driven al models). . the model framework does not address the risk of catastrophic failure due to cyber-attacks on an organisation heavily dependent on al. organisations remain responsible for ensuring the availability, reliability, quality and safety of their products and services, regardless of whether al technologies are used: . adopting this voluntary model framework will not absolve organisations from compliance with current laws and regulations: however; as this is an accountability-based framework, adopting it will assist  organisations in demonstrating that had implemented accountability-based practices in data management and protection, eg- the pdpa and oecd privacy principles . further; it should be noted that certain industry sectors (such as in the finance, healthcare, and legal sectors) may be regulated by existing  sector-specific laws,  regulations or guidelines relevant to the sector: for example, the monetary authority of singapore published the principles to promote fairness, ethics, accountability and transparency in the use of artificial intelligence and data analytics in singapore's financial sector (the feat principles"") to provide guidance to firms that use al and data analytics to offer financial products and services.? organisations are advised to remain mindful of such laws, regulations and guidelines, as adopting the model framework does not mean that organisations are in compliance with such sector-specific laws, regulations or guidelines monetary authority of singapore, ""principles to promote fairness, ethics, accountability and transparency (feat) in the use of artificial intelligence and data analytics in singapore's financial sector' ( november )  . they



 definitions f . the following simplified diagram depicts the stakeholders in an al adoption process discussed in the model framework the adoption process does not distinguish between business- to-consumer (""b2c""), business-to-business (""b2b"") , and business- to-business-to-consumer (""b2bzc"") relationships: al solution providers organisations individuals . some terms used in al may have different definitions depending on context and use. the definitions of some terms used in this model framework are as follows: refers to a set of technologies that seek to simulate human ""al"" traits such as knowledge, reasoning, problem solving, perception; learning and planning, and, depending on the al model, produce an output or decision (such as a prediction, recommendation, and/or classification): al technologies rely on al algorithms to generate models. the most appropriate model(s) is/are selected and deployed in a production system. al solution develop al solutions or application systems that make providers"" use of al technology: these include not just commercial off-the-shelf products, online services, mobile applications, and other software that consumers can use directly, but also b2bzc applications, e.g: al-powered fraud detection software sold to financial institutions. also include device and equipment manufacturers that integrate al-powered features into their products, and those whose solutions are not standalone products but are meant to be integrated into a final product: some organisations develop their own al solutions and can be their own solution providers. ""organisations refers to companies or other entities that adopt or deploy al solutions in their  operations, such as backroom operations processing applications for loans) , front-of-house services (e.g: e-commerce portal or ride-hailing app) , or the sale or distribution of devices that provide al-powered features (e.g: smart home appliances). ""individuals"" can, depending on the context, refer to persons to whom organisations intend to supply al products and/or services, or persons who have already purchased the al products and/or services these may be referred to as consumers or customers' as well: this definition of al was adapted from various sources, and contextualised accordingly for the purposes of this model framework. it should not be taken to be an authoritative or exhaustive definition. key key they (e.g:

 model ai governance framework . this model framework   comprises   guidance on measures promoting the responsible use of al that organisations should adopt in the following areas: a internal governance structures and measures adapting existing or setting up internal governance structure and measures to incorporate values, risks, and responsibilities relating to algorithmic decision-making: b_ determining the level of human involvement in al-augmented decision-making a methodology to aid organisations in setting its risk appetite for use of al, i.e. determining acceptable risks and identifying an appropriate level of human involvement in al-augmented decision-making: c operations management issues to be considered when developing, selecting and maintaining al models, including data management: d. stakeholder interaction and communication strategies for  communicating with an organisation's stakeholders , and the management of relationships with them: . organisations adopting this model framework may find that not all elements are relevant: this model framework is meant to be flexible, and organisations can adapt the model framework to suit their needs and adopting those elements that are relevant: . to help organisations better understand the model framework, we have included (in each section) illustrations demonstrating how real-world companies have implemented certain practices described in that section. in addition, the pdpc has also released a compendium of use cases that illustrates how various local and international organisations have put in place al governance practices that are aligned to all sections of the model framework. key specific



model artificial intelligence governance framework  internal governance structures and measures . this section is intended to organisations in developing appropriate internal governance structures that allow organisations to have appropriate oversight over how ai technologies are brought into their operations and/or products and services. . internal governance structures and measures help to ensure robust oversight over an organisation's use of ai. the organisation's existing internal governance structures can be adapted, andlor new structures can be implemented if necessary: for example, risks associated with the use of al can be managed within the enterprise risk management structure, while ethical considerations can be introduced as corporate values and managed through ethics review boards or similar structures: ethical considerations can be introduced as corporate values and managed through ethics review boards or similar structures. . organisations may also consider determining the appropriate features in their internal governance structures. for example, when relying completely on a centralised governance mechanism is not optimal, a de-centralised one could be considered to incorporate ethical considerations into day-to-day decision- making at the operational level, if necessary: the sponsorship, support and participation of the organisation's top management and its board of directors in the organisation's al governance are crucial: guide



 . organisations may wish to consider including features that are relevant to the development of their internal governance structure, such as:  clear roles and responsibilities for the ethical deployment of ai a responsibility for and oversight of the various stages and activities involved in al deployment should be allocated to the appropriate  personnel and/or departments. if necessary and possible, consider establishing a coordinating body, having relevant expertise and proper representation from across the organisation: b personnel andlor departments having internal al governance functions should be fully aware of their roles and responsibilities, be properly trained, and be provided with the resources and guidance needed for them to discharge their duties. c roles and responsibilities that can be allocated include: l. using any existing risk management framework and applying risk control measures (see risk management and internal controls' below) to: assess and manage the risks of deploying al, including any potential adverse impact on the individuals who are most vulnerable, how are impacted, how to assess the scale of the impact, how to get feedback from those impacted, etc ) decide on the appropriate level of human involvement in al-augmented decision-making: manage the al model training and selection process: key (e.g: they



model artificial intelligence governance framework  ii. maintenance, monitoring, documentation and review of the al models that have been deployed, with a view to taking remediation measures where needed. mi. reviewing communications channels and interactions with stakeholders to provide disclosure and effective feedback channels. iv. ensuring relevant staff dealing with al systems are properly trained. where applicable and necessary, staff who are working and interacting directly with al models may need to be trained to interpret al model output and decisions and to detect and manage bias in data: other staff whose work deals with the al system (e.g: a customer relationship officer answering customer queries about the al system, or a salesperson   using an al-enabled product to make a recommendation) should be trained to be at least aware of and sensitive to the benefits, risks and limitations when using al, so that they know when to alert subject-matter experts within their organisations



 . risk management and internal controls a organisations can consider implementing a sound system of risk management and internal controls that specifically addresses the risks involved in the deployment of the selected al model. b such measures include: using reasonable efforts to ensure that the datasets used for al model training are adequate for the intended purpose, and to assess and manage the risks of inaccuracy or bias, as well as reviewing exceptions identified during model training: virtually, no dataset is   completely unbiased. organisations should strive to understand the ways in which datasets may be biased and address this in their safety measures and deployment strategies ii. establishing monitoring and reporting systems as well as processes to ensure that the appropriate level of management is aware of the performance of and other issues relating to the deployed ai. where appropriate, the monitoring can include autonomous monitoring to effectively scale human oversight: al systems can be designed to report on the confidence level of their predictions, and explainability features could focus on why the al model had a certain level of confidence. mii. ensuring proper knowledge transfer whenever there are changes in personnel involved in ai activities. this will reduce the risk of staff movement creating a gap in internal governance. iv. reviewing the internal governance structure and measures when there are significant changes to organisational structure or personnel involved. v_ periodically reviewing the internal governance structure and measures to ensure their continued relevance and effectiveness: key key

 determining the level of human involvement in ai- augmented decision-making . this section is intended to help organisations determine the appropriate extent of human   oversight in al-augmented decision-making: . having clarity on the objective of using al is a first step in determining the extent of human oversight: organisations can start by deciding on their commercial objectives of using al ensuring consistency in decision-making, improving operational efficiency and reducing costs, or introducing new product features to increase consumer choice): these commercial objectives can then be weighed against the risks of using al in the organisation's decision-making: this assessment should be guided by organisations' corporate values, which in turn, could reflect the societal norms or expectations of the territories in which the organisations operate. before deploying al solutions, organisations should decide on their commercial objectives of using al, and then weigh them against the risks of using al in the organisation's decision-making: . it is also desirable for organisations operating in multiple countries to consider the differences in societal norms, values and/or expectations, where possible. forexample, gaming advertisements may be acceptable in one country but not in another: even within a country, risks may vary significantly depending on where al is deployed: for example, risks to individuals associated with recommendation engines that promote products in an online mall or automating the approval of online applications for travel insurance may be lower than the risks associated with algorithmic trading facilities offered to sophisticated investors. key (e.g:



model artificial intelligence governance framework  . some risks to individuals may only manifest at group level: for example, widespread adoption of a stock recommendation algorithm might cause herding behaviour; increasing overall market volatility if sufficiently large numbers of individuals make similar decisions atthe same time. in addition to risks to individuals, other types of risks may also be identified risk to an organisation's commercial reputation): . organisations' weighing of their commercial objectives against the risks of using al should ideally be guided by their corporate values. organisations can assess if the intended al deployment and the selected model for algorithmic decision-making are consistent with their own core values: inconsistencies and deviations should be conscious decisions made by organisations with a clearly defined and documented rationale. . as identifying commercial objectives, risks and determining the appropriate level of human involvement in al-augmented decision-making is an iterative and ongoing process, it is desirable for organisations to continually identify and review risks relevant to their technology solutions, mitigate those risks, and maintain a response plan should mitigation fail. documenting this   process   through a periodically reviewed risk impact assessment helps organisations develop clarity and confidence in using the al solutions: it will also help organisations respond to potential challenges from individuals, other organisations or businesses, and regulators (e.g. any



 what are the three broad approaches of human involvement in ai-augmented decision-making? . based on the risk management approach described above, the model framework identifies three broad approaches to classify the various degrees of human oversight in the decision-making process: a human-in-the-loop suggests that human oversight is active and involved, with the human retaining full controlandthe al only providing recommendations or input: decisions cannot be exercised without affirmative actions by the human, such as a human command to proceed with a given decision. for example, a doctor may use al to identify possible diagnoses of and treatments for an unfamiliar medical condition. however; the doctor will make the final decision on the diagnosis and the corresponding treatment: this model requires al to provide enough information for the human to make an informed decision (e.g. factors that are used in the decision, their value and weighting, correlations): b human-out-of-the-loop suggests that there is no human oversight over the execution of decisions the al system has full control without the option of human override. for example, a product recommendation solution may automatically suggest products and services to individuals based on pre-determined demographic and behavioural profiles al can also dynamically create new profiles, then make product and service suggestions rather than relying on predetermined categories. machine learning model might also be used by an airline to forecast demand or likely disruptions, and the outputs of this model are used by a solver module to optimise the airline's scheduling, without a human in the c human-over-the-loop (orhuman-on-the-loop) suggests that human oversight is involved to the extent that the human is in a monitoring or supervisory role, with the ability to take over control when the al model encounters unexpected or undesirable events (such as model failure). this approach allows humans to adjust parameters during the operation of the algorithm. for example, a gps navigation system plans the route from point a to point b, offering several possible routes for the driver to pick the driver can alter parameters (e.g: due to unforeseen road congestions) during the trip without having to re-programme the route. loop.



model artificial intelligence governance framework  . the model framework also proposes a design framework (structured as a matrix) to help organisations determine the level ofhuman involvement required in al-augmented decision-making: this design framework is structured two axes: the (a) probability; and (b) severity ofharm to an individual (or organisation) as a result of the decision made by an organisation about that individual (or organisation): . the definition of harm and the computation of probability and severity will depend on the context and vary from sector to sector: for example, the considerations of a hospital regarding the harm associated with a wrong diagnosis of a patients medical condition will differ from the considerations of a clothing store's regarding the harm associated with a wrong product recommendation for apparels. hieh severity high severity l low probability high probability ""  low severity low severity low probability high probability probability of harm . the matrix, however; should not be taken to imply that the probability of harm and severity of harm are the only factors to be considered in determining the level ofhuman oversight in an organisation's decision-making process involving al (although are generally two of the more important factors) c . for safety-critical systems, it would be prudent for organisations to ensure that a person be allowed to assume control, with the al system providing sufficient information for that person to make meaningful decisions or to safely shut down the system where human control is not possible. other factors that organisations in various contexts may consider relevant; could also include: (a) the nature of harm (i.e: whether the harm is physical or intangible in nature); (b) the reversibility of harm, and as a corollary to this, the ability for individuals to obtain recourse; and (c) whether it is operationally feasible or meaningful for a human to be involved in decision-making process having human-in-the-loop would be unfeasible in high- financial trading, and be impractical in the case of driverless vehicles) along they (e.g. speed



 using the probability-severity of harm matrix an online retail store wishes to use al to fully automate the recommendation of food products to individuals based highly on their browsing behaviours and purchase histories. the recommended! automation will meet the organisation's commercial objective of operational efficiency: probability-severity assessment the definition of harm can be the impact of making product recommendations that do not address the perceived needs of the individuals. the severity of harm in making the wrong product recommendations to individuals may be low since individuals ultimately decide whether to make the purchase: the probability of harm may be high or low depending on the efficiency and efficacy of the al solution. degree of human intervention in decision-making process given the low severity of harm, the assessment to an approach that requires no human intervention (i.e: human-out-of-the-loop): high severity high severity ! low probability high probability "" low severity low severity  low probability high probability lumameout ofethe-loop probability of harm regular review the organisation regularly reviews its approach (i.e. human-out-of-the-loop) to re-assess the severity and probability of harm, and as societal norms and values evolve. note: this is a simple illustration using bright-line norms and values. organisations can consider testing this method of determining the al decision-making model against cases with more challenging and complex ethical dilemmas. points



model artificial intelligence governance framework  suade labs: illustration on determining the level of human involvement in ai-augmented decision-making suade labs (""suade"" ) is a regtech firm that operates globally and is a world economic forum technology pioneer: suade provides an al-enabled solution that allows financial institutions to process large volumes of granular data and generate the required regulatory data, calculations, and reports with the necessary controls and governance. suade's solution also allows users to analyse the impact of the existing stock of regulation, including the impact of individual pieces of legislation. in determining the level of human involvement in decision-making using al, suade considered the following key factors: a degree of domain knowledge legal or policy-making knowledge) required to accurately interpret the results of the algorithm. b_ cost of non-compliance to regulation if the al tool does not accurately analyse the impact of regulation and provide correct suggestions for regulatory compliance. as suade's solution requires a certain degree of domain knowledge from human experts, and given that the cost of regulatory non-compliance as a result of incorrect recommendations made by the al solution will be significant to users, suade has thus adopted a human-in-the-loop approach for its al solution: on the other hand, when it comes to tuning the al model, suade adopts a human-over-the-loop approach: in general, suade tunes the al model to automatically favour the identification of false positives over false negatives. however; suade conducted user research, which informed them that some users the model to favour false negatives over false positives. therefore, suade adopts a human-over-the-loop approach so that the al model can be tuned to account for the differing preferences of its users with respect to whether the algorithm produces results that favours false positives or false negatives: (e.g: prefer



 grab: illustration on determining the level of human involvement in ai-augmented decision-making grab is a singapore-based company that offers ride-hailing transport services, food delivery and e-payment solutions. it uses al across its platform, from ride allocation, detecting safety incidents, to identifying fraudulent transactions. in particular; grab uses al to improve the overall quality of trip allocations and minimise trip cancellations: to allocate trips successfully, grab's al model considers drivers' preferences based on the following key factors: a_ drivers preferences for certain trip types; b. preferred locations where a driver start and end their and c other selective driving behaviours. in determining the level of human involvement in its al's decision-making for trip allocation, grab considered the following factors: a the scale of real-time decision-making required. as grab has to make over , trip allocations every minute, this would mean an impact to customers in terms of 'efficiency and cost if a human had to review each trip allocation; and b_ the severity and probability to users should the al model work in a sub- optimal manner: among other factors, grab considered that: () it is not technically feasible for a human to make high volume of trip allocations in a short amount oftime; and () there is often little or no harm to life should there be less than optimal trip allocations. hence , grab decided to adopt a human-out-of-the-loop approach for its al model deployed for trip allocation, while continuously reviewing the al model to ensure optimal performance: day; key such



model artificial intelligence governance framework  operations management . this section is intended to help organisations adopt responsible measures in the operations aspect of their al adoption process: reference al adoption process is set out in order to provide a context for the recommendations for good governance in respect of the organisation's data, algorithm and al model. . the model framework uses the following generalised al model development and deployment process to describe phases in implementing an al solution by an organisation. it should be noted that this process is not always uni-directional _ it can, and usually is, a continuous process of learning: data preparation algorithms chosen model stage : stage : stage : raw data is formatted models are trained on the chosen model is and cleansed so the dataset and used to produce conclusions can be algorithms may be probability scores that drawn accurately: this includes can be incorporated generally; accuracy and statistical or machine into applications to insights increase with learning models offer predictions, make relevance and the including decision trees decisions, solve amount of data_ and neural networks_ the problems and trigger results are examined and actions. models are iterated until the most appropriate model emerges_ machine learning algorithms raw data data pre- prepared apply candidate chosen processing data algorithms model model raw and/or train data al model application iterate until data is ready iterate for most appropriate model adapted from machine learning at scale microsoft azure ( december )  (accessed december ). applied.



 . during   deployment; algorithms such as linear   regression algorithms, decision trees, or neural networks are for analysis on training datasets. the resulting algorithmic models are examined and algorithms are iterated until a model that produces the most appropriate results for the use case emerges this model and its results are then incorporated into applications to offer predictions, make decisions, solve problems and trigger actions. the intimate interaction between data and algorithm/ model is the focus of this part of the model framework data for model development . datasets used for building models may come from multiple sources, and could include both personal and non-personal data. the quality and selection of data from each of these sources are critical to the success of an al solution: if a model is built using biased, inaccurate or non-representative  data, the risks of unintended discriminatory decisions from the model will increase. to ensure the effectiveness of an al solution, relevant departments within the organisation with responsibilities over quality of data, model training and model selection must work together to put in place data accountability practices. . the persons who are involved in training and selecting models for deployment may be internal staff or external service providers it is ideal for the models deployed in an intelligent to have an internal departmental owner; who will be the one making decisions on which models to deploy: to ensure the effectiveness of an al solution, it would be helpful for relevant departments within the organisation with responsibilities over quality of data, model training and model selection to work together to put in place good data accountability practices. these include the following: applied good system



model artificial intelligence governance framework  a  understanding the lineage of data: this means knowing where the data originally came from, how it was collected, curated and moved within the organisation, and how its accuracy is maintained over time. data lineage can be represented visually to trace how the data moves from its source to its destination, how the data transformed along the way; where itinteracts with other data, and how the representations change: there are three types of data lineage: backward data lineage looks at the data from its end-use and backdating it to its source. ii. forward data lineage begins at the data's source and follows it through to its end-use. iii. end-to-end data lineage combines the two and looks at the entire solution from both the data's source to its end-use and from its end-use to its source. keeping a data provenance record allows an organisation to ascertain the quality of the data based on its origin and subsequent transformation, trace potential sources of errors, data, and attribute data to their sources: in some instances, the origin of  data could be difficult to establish. one example could be datasets obtained from a trusted third-party which may have commingled data from multiple sources: it would be prudent for organisations to assess the risks of using such data and manage them accordingly: gets update



 b ensuring data quality: organisations are encouraged to understand and address factors that may affect the quality of data, such as: the accuracy of the dataset, in terms of how well the values in the dataset match the true characteristics of the entities described by the dataset; ii. the completeness of the dataset, both in terms of attributes and items; iii. the veracity of the dataset, which refers to how credible the data is, including whether the data originated from a reliable source; iv. how recently the dataset was compiled or updated; the relevance of the dataset and the context for data collection, as it may affect the interpretation of and reliance on the data for the intended purpose; vi. the integrity of the dataset that has been joined from multiple datasets, which refers to how well extraction and transformation have been performed; vii. the usability of the dataset; including how well the dataset is structured in a machine- understandable and viii. human interventions ifany human has filtered, labels, or edited the data): minimising inherent bias: there are many types of bias relevant to ai: the model framework focuses on inherent bias in datasets, which may lead to undesired outcomes such as unintended discriminatory decisions. organisations should be aware that the data which provide to al systems could contain inherent biases and are encouraged to take steps to mitigate such bias. the two common types of bias in data include: form; (e.g: applied they



model artificial intelligence governance framework  selection bias: this bias occurs when the data used to produce the model are not fully representative of the actual data or environment thatthe model may receive or function in. common examples of selection bias in datasets are omission bias and stereotype bias. omission bias describes the omission of certain characteristics from the dataset: for example, a dataset consisting only of asian faces will exhibit omission bias ifit is used for facial recognition training for a population that includes non-asians: a dataset of vehicle types within the central business district on a weekday may exhibit stereotype bias weighted in favour of cars, buses and motorcycles but under-represent bicycles if it is used to model the  types of transportation available in singapore: ti. measurement bias: this bias occurs when the data collection device causes the data to be systematically skewed in a particular direction. for example, the training data could be obtained using camera with a colour filter that has been turned off, thereby skewing the machine learning result: while identifying and addressing inherent bias in datasets may not be easy, organisations can mitigate the risk of inherent bias by having a heterogeneous dataset (i.e. collecting data from a variety of reliable sources): another way is to ensure the dataset is as complete as possible, both from the perspective of data attributes and data items premature removal of data attributes can make it difficult to identify and address inherent bias.



 d. different datasets for training; testing; and validation: different datasets are required for training, testing, and validation. the model is trained using the training data , while the model's accuracy is determined using the test data. where applicable, the model could also be checked for systematic bias by testing it on different demographic groups to observe whether any groups are being systematically advantaged or disadvantaged: finally, the trained model can be validated using the validation dataset: it is considered good practice to split a large dataset into subsets for these purposes, if it does not lead to a significant reduction in the quality of data in terms of accuracy and representation. however; where this is not possible (e.g: if the organisation is not working with large datasets or are using pre-trained models as in the case of transfer learning), organisations are encouraged to be cognisant of the risks of systematic bias and in  place appropriate safeguards. periodic reviewing and updating of datasets: it would be prudent for datasets (including training, testing, and validation datasets) to be reviewed periodically to ensure accuracy,  quality,  currency, relevance and reliability: where necessary, the datasets can be updated with new input data obtained from actual use of the al models deployed in production. when such new input data is used, organisations need to be aware of potential bias as using new input data that has already gone through a model once could create a reinforcement bias. . even if only non-personal data are used for the training of al models (including personal data that has been anonymised) , the data accountability practices above remain relevant: put good



model artificial intelligence governance framework  suade labs: illustration on managing data for model development suade (introduced above) has developed an al-enabled solution that financial institutions generate the required data and reports to comply with regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions where operate: as the data used for suade's al model development directly affects its quality and performance, suade has adopted several good data accountability practices: for example, to ensure that regulatory data comes from a credible and reliable source  suade obtains and updates regulatory data only from the relevant regulators in addition, suade tags the datasets used with additional metadata. this allows suade to trace datasets back to their original source when needed, such as where inconsistencies are found. further; in order to trace which particular datasets were used in an al model, suade also documents and stores such information pertaining to model development on its database. suade also minimises the inherent risks of al models through responsible data tagging: by using a larger number of taggers (i.e. people who tag data), suade aims to make the output of its al models as neutral as possible, and reduce the risk of its taggers being influenced by the context ofthe data (which often comprise of text) are annotating: in other words, suade uses as many individuals as practicable to tag data to reduce the risk of tagger bias. in addition, suade developed a tagging system to facilitate the annotation of data: this system is used to generate training data used by the algorithm. suade will further develop this tagging system to enhance its ability to manage multiple annotators and to better select datasets used for model training: suade also periodically updates the tagging system with new data. new training data is subsequently fed repeatedly back into the al model. this way, the al model is able to continuously learn from new sets of data. another data accountability practice that suade adopts is the use of validation schema checks at various stages of data transformation: this is a process in which suade verifies that the data schema accurately represents the data from the source, to ensure that there are no errors in factors such as the data's formatting and content: helps they they



 pymetrics: illustration on managing biases in datasets for model development pymetrics is a technology provider that uses neuroscience insights and audited al models to help evaluate applicants in a more predictive and less biased manner: to develop an al model, pymetrics: gets its   clients' top-performing employees to go through pymetrics' assessments, and builds a trait of an employee that best fit the specific job role; validates the trait profile with the clients hr team; and collects behavioural data of applicants  through  pymetrics'   gamified assessments, and assesses the suitability of the applicants based on the trait profile. to deal with socially sensitive features and mitigate the risk of inherent or unintentional bias in the datasets used by the al model, pymetrics: uses objective data based on established neuroscience research attention to detail, attention span and ability to recall) , which are generally stable across gender; racial and age groups. proactively de-biases all al models to ensure that are fully representative of the environment that may function in, so that the al models do not disadvantage   people on the basis of their   demographic features: the standards for fairness are informed by legal requirements as a pre- hire assessment; pymetrics models must pass a test known as the four- fifths rule""_ which is commonly cited in employment law. according to us' equal employment opportunity commission (""eeoc"") , the selection rate for any legally protected group must be at least % of the selection rate for the majority group. for example, if an employer screens  qualified applicants ( men and  women), a model that selects  men must also select at least  women: pymetrics will test the al model against a dataset of users from diverse demographics to ensure that random patterns in the data are not learned by the model and to address any potential for bias. profile (e.g: they they



model artificial intelligence governance framework  pymetrics would conduct further de-biasing on additional demographic based on geographical relevance or legal requirements: pymetrics uses a bias ratio to compare the proportional pass rates of the highest-passing demographic group with the lowest-passing group for each demographic category (e.g: gender and ethnicity). the al model would be deployed only if meet the eeoc standards. after al deployment; pymetrics: will test the al model's decisions on real applicants for adverse impact; and revisits the long-term impact of its system's predictions on retention for the role. if bias is found either before or after deployment, pymetrics will adjust the al modelto optimise for fairness towards while ensuring the predictive performance of the al model: algorithm and model . al systems may have numerous features or functionalities enabled through algorithms in al models. measures such as explainability, repeatability, robustness, regular reproducibility, traceability, and auditability can enhance the transparency of algorithms found in al models. it may not be feasible or cost- effective to implement even the most essential ofthese measures for all algorithms: organisations are encouraged to take a risk-based approach in making a two-fold assessment: first, identify the subset of features or functionalities that have the greatest impact on stakeholders for which such measures are relevant. second, identify which of these measures will be most effective in building trust with their  stakeholders: some of these measures like explainability (or repeatability, when using models that are not easily explained) , robustness and regular tuning are sufficiently essential that could, to varying extents, be incorporated as part of the organisation's al deployment process. other measures, such as reproducibility, traceability and auditability are more resource-intensive and may be relevant for features or in specific scenarios. they applicants tuning, they specific



 explainability . explainability is achieved by explaining how deployed al models' algorithms function and/or how the decision-making process incorporates model predictions: the purpose of being able to explain predictions made by al is to build understanding and trust: an algorithm deployed in an al solution is said to be explainable if how it functions and how it arrives at a particular prediction can be explained: when an algorithm cannot be explained, understanding and trust can still be built by explaining how predictions play a role in the decision-making process: . organisations deploying al solutions are recommended to adopt the following practices: a_ model training and selection are necessary for developing an intelligent system (i.e. a system that contains al technologies). documenting how the model training and selection processes are conducted, the reasons for which decisions are made, and measures taken to address identified risks will enable the organisation to provide an account of the decisions subsequently: in this regard, the field of automated machine learning aims to automate a significant portion of machine learning workflows, including feature  engineering, feature selection, model selection and hyper-parameter tuning: organisations using these types of tools can consider the transparency; explainability and traceability of the automated machine learning approach, as well as the models selected. b incorporating descriptions of the solutions' design and expected behaviour into product or service descriptions and system technical specifications documentation demonstrates   accountability to individuals andlor regulators. this could also include design decisions in relation to why certain features, attributes or models are selected in place of others. these steps can help provide greater clarity on an al model by giving understandable and digestible insights into how the model operates:



model artificial intelligence governance framework  where an organisation's al system was obtained or procured from a third-party al solution provider; the organisation can consider requesting assistance from the al solution provider as may be better placed to explain how the solution functions. c supplementary   explanation tools are helpful for explaining al models; especially models that are less interpretable (also known as black box"" systems): these tools help make the underlying rationale of an al system's output more interpretable and intelligible to those who use the system. it is possible to use a combination of these tools to improve the explainability of an al model's decision: . technical explainability may not always be enlightening, especially to the man on the street: implicit explanations of how the al models' algorithms function may be more useful than explicit descriptions of the models' logic for example, providing an individual with counterfactuals (such as you would have been approved if your average debt was % lower"") andlor comparisons (such as these are users with similar profiles to yours that received a similar decision"") can be a powerful type of explanation that organisations could consider: . nevertheless, there may be scenarios where it might not be practical or reasonable to provide information in relation to an algorithm. for example, disclosing algorithms deployed for anti- money laundering detection, information security, and fraud prevention may allow bad actors to avoid detection; likewise , providing detailed information about proprietary algorithms or the decisions made by the algorithms may expose confidential business information. these tools are known as supplementary' as there is at present no single comprehensive technical solution for making al models explainable. these tools thus play a supplementary role in providing some level of interpretability on an al model's operation. examples of these tools include the use of surrogate models, partial dependence plots, global variable importancelinteraction, sensitivity analysis, counterfactual explanations, or self-explaining and attention-based systems_ they



 repeatability . where explainability cannot practicably be achieved given the state of technology, organisations can consider documenting the repeatability of results produced by the al model. repeatability refers to the ability to consistently perform an action or make a decision, given the same scenario. while repeatability (of results) is not equivalent to explainability (of algorithm) , some degree of assurance of consistency in performance could provide al users with a larger degree of confidence. helpful practices include: a conducting repeatability assessments for commercial deployments in live environments to ensure that deployments are repeatable; b performing counterfactual fairness testing: counterfactual fairness testing ensures that a model's decisions are the same in both the real world and in a counterfactual world where attributes deemed sensitive (such as race or gender) are altered; c assessing how exceptions can be identified and handled when decisions are not repeatable, e.g: when randomness has been introduced by design; d. ensuring   exception   handling is in line with organisations' policies; in this regard, it may be helpful to use al models that are able to recognise when a given set of facts contains new variables not previously considered and are able to highlight these new variables to a human; e identifying and accounting for changes over time to ensure that models trained on time-sensitive data remain relevant: james manyika , jake sitberg, and brittany presten, ""what do we do about the biases in al?"" harvard business review ( october )  (accessed  october ).



model artificial intelligence governance framework  robustness . robustness refers to the ability of a computer system to cope with errors during execution and erroneous input, and is assessed by the degree to which a system or component can function correctly in the presence of invalid input or stressful environmental conditions. ensuring that deployed models are sufficiently robust will contribute towards building trust in the al system. . the concept of robustness arises because it is not possible for models to be able to enumerate and set out all preconditions and consequences for an action. this creates the possibility of models producing insensible or unexpected results even with minor modifications to input data (thatmay not even be perceptible to humans) testing for robustness can be achieved through scenario-based testing for foreseeable erroneous input  to ensure that models are more robust, organisations can consider working with al developers to conduct adversarial testing on their models to ensure that their models are able to handle a broader range of unexpected input variables (especially for public-facing al systems). as this is a resource-intensive exercise , organisations can take a risk-based approach towards identifying the subset of al-powered features in their products or services that requires adversarial testing: . no model can be perfectly robust as it is not possible to detect all possible modifications to a set of input data. for this reason, organisations intending to use continual learning (i.e: where the learned parameters of a machine learning model are not fixed but the model continues to change its learned parameters after being deployed into production) are encouraged to be aware of the risks of doing so, should the continual learning model behave in an unpredictable manner this is distinct from user acceptance testing (""uat"") , which is process where actual software users test piece of software to ensure that it can handle required tasks in real- world scenarios, based on specifications uat is often critical step that is taken before newly-developed software is released to the market:



 regular tuning . establishing an internal policy and process to perform regular model tuning is effective for ensuring that deployed models cater for changes to customer behaviour over time. this allows organisations to refresh models based on updated training datasets that incorporate new input data. model tuning may also be necessary when commercial objectives, risks, or corporate values change. . wherever possible, testing should reflect the dynamism of the planned production environment: to ensure safety, testing may need to assess the degree to which an al solution generalises well and fails gracefully: for example, a warehouse robot tasked with avoiding obstacles to complete a task picking up packages) could be tested with different types of obstacles and realistically varied internal environments workers wearing a variety of different coloured shirts). otherwise, models risk learning regularities in the environment that do not reflect actual production environment conditions assuming that all humans that it must avoid will be wearing white lab coats). once al models are deployed in the real-world environment; active monitoring, review and tuning are advised. traceability . an al model is considered to be traceable if (a) its decisions, and (b) the datasets and processes that the al model's decision (including those of data gathering, data labelling and the algorithms used) , are documented in an easily understandable way: the former refers to traceability of al-augmented decisions, while the latter refers to traceability in model training: traceability facilitates transparency and explainability, and is also helpful for other reasons. first, the information might also be useful for troubleshooting, or for an investigation into how the model was functioning or why a particular prediction was made. second, the traceability record (in the form ofan audit log) can be a source of input data that can be used as a training dataset in the future. (e.g: (e.g. (e.g: yield



model artificial intelligence governance framework  . practices that organisations may consider to promote traceability include: a building an audit trail to document the model training and al-augmented decision. b. implementing a black box recorder that captures all input data streams. for example, a black box recorder in a driving car tracks the vehicle's position and records when and where the self-driving system takes control of the vehicle, suffers a technical problem or requests the driver to take over the control of the vehicle. c= ensuring that data relevant to traceability are stored appropriately to avoid degradation or alteration, and retained for durations relevant to the industry: . as traceability measures may lead to an accumulation of a large volume of activity data, organisations can consider which oftheir product features   require   traceability and which  traceability measures might be sufficient for their needs, bearing in mind the resources needed to document the al model's decisions, datasets and processes. organisations could assess this based on several factors, including: a their assessment of the probability andlor severity of harm arising from the use of the al system; bs the extent to which the al model had previously been trialled or used; and c the regulatory needs of their industry: it should be noted that black box recorder does not refer to ""black box in the al model sense (i.e. where the decision-making process of an al model is inherently difficult to interpret and explain). self_



 reproducibility . while repeatability refers to the internal repetition of results within ones organisation, reproducibility refers to the ability of an independent verification team to produce the same results using the same al method based on the documentation made by the organisation. reproducibility can influence the trustworthiness of the al product and the organisation deploying the al model. as implementing  reproducibility entails the involvement of external parties, organisations can take a risk-based approach towards identifying the subset of al-powered features in their products or services that requires external reproducibility testing: . the following practices contribute towards reproducibility: a_ testing whether  specific   contexts or particular conditions would need to be taken into account to ensure reproducibility; b. putting in place verification methods to ensure different aspects of the al models reliability and reproducibility; c making available replication files (.e. files that replicate each step of the al models developmental process) to facilitate the process of testing and reproducing behaviours; d. for companies that procure commercial off-the-shelf al systems, checking with the original al solution provider about whether the model's results are reproducible; and adopting in paragraph . (c)-(e) under repeatability (namely, assessing how exceptions can be identified and handled, ensuring that exception- handling is in line with organisational policies, and identifying and accounting for changes over time). points



model artificial intelligence governance framework  auditability . auditability refers to the readiness of an al system to undergo an assessment of its algorithms, data and design processes. the evaluation of the al system by internal or external auditors (and the availability of evaluation reports) can contribute to the trustworthiness of the al  system as it demonstrates the responsibility of design and practices and the justifiability of outcomes: it should, however; be noted that auditability does not necessarily entail making information about business models or intellectual property related to the al system publicly available: . implementing auditability not only entails the involvement of external parties but requires disclosure of commercially sensitive information to the auditors, who may be external. organisations can take a risk-based approach towards identifying the subset of al-powered features in their products or services for which implementing auditability is necessary, or where implementing auditability is necessary for an organisation to align itself with regulatory requirements or industry practice. . to facilitate auditability, organisations can consider keeping a comprehensive record of data provenance, procurement, pre- processing, lineage, storage and security: the record could also include   qualitative  input about data   representations, data sufficiency, source integrity, data timelines, data relevance, and unforeseen data issues encountered across the workflow: . organisations may also wish to centralise such information digitally in a process this would enable the organisation to make available, in one place, information that may assistin demonstrating to concerned parties and affected decision subjects both the responsibility of design and practices and the justifiability of the outcomes of your system's processing behaviour: such a would also enable better organisation of the accessibility and presentation of information yielded, assist in the curation and protection of data that should be kept unavailable from view, and increase the organisation's capacity to cater the presentation of results to different tiers of stakeholders with different interests and levels of expertise. log: log public

model artificial intelligence governance framework  stakeholder interaction and communication  . this section is intended to help organisations take appropriate steps to build trust in the stakeholder relationship strategies when deploying ai. general disclosure . organisations are encouraged to provide general information on whether al is used in their products and/or services. where appropriate, this could include information on what al is, how al is used in decision-making in relation to consumers, what are its benefits, why your organisation has decided to use al, how your organisation has taken steps to mitigate risks, and the role and extent that al plays in the decision-making process. for example, an online portal may inform its users that are interacting with an al-powered chatbot and not a human customer service agent: . organisations can consider disclosing the manner in which an al decision may affect an individual consumer; and whether the decision is reversible. for example, an organisation may inform the individuals that their credit ratings may lead to a loan refusal not only from this organisation but also from other  similar organisations, while also informing them that such a decision is reversible if individuals can provide more evidence on their credit worthiness. policy for explanation . organisations are encouraged to develop a policy on what explanations to provide to individuals and when to provide them. such policies help ensure consistency in communication, and clearly sets out roles and responsibilities of different members of your organisation. these can include explanations on how ai works in an al-augmented decision-making process, how a specific decision was made and the reasons behind that decision, and the impact and consequence of the decision. the explanation can be provided as part of general communication: it can also be information in respect of a decision upon request: in this regard, the principle of equivalence can provide some guidance such that the same standards of disclosure forhuman- driven decisions is applied to decisions that have been made or augmented by an al system. they specific



 bringing explainability and transparency together in a meaningful way . appropriate interaction and communication inspire trust and confidence as build and maintain open relationships between organisations and individuals (including employees) . stakeholder relationship strategies should also not remain static. companies are encouraged to test, evaluate and review their strategies for effectiveness: further; the extent and mode of implementation of these factors could vary from scenario to scenario. . as different stakeholders have different information needs, an organisation can start by first identifying its audience (i.e: its external and internal stakeholders). an organisation's external stakeholders may include consumers, regulators, other organisations it does business with, and society at large. its internal  stakeholders may include the organisation's board, management and employees. an organisation can also consider the purpose and the context of the interaction with its stakeholders. for the purposes of  illustration, this model framework provides considerations for interacting with consumers and other organisations: as different stakeholders have different information needs, an organisation can start by first identifying its audience and considering the purpose and the context of the interaction. interacting with consumers . organisations are encouraged to consider the information needs of consumers as go through the journey of interacting with al , from considering whether to use an al solution, to understanding how the al solution works as they use it, to requesting for reviews on the decisions made by the al solution: a typical consumer journey may entail meeting the following information needs of consumers: they they



model artificial intelligence governance framework  a making sure that consumers are aware that the products or services that are considering are al-enabled. such information could be provided as part of a general product description. b providing information so that consumers know how the al-enabled features are expected to behave during normal use_ the information could be provided in more detailed descriptions or specifications of product features. this, however; may not be necessary for every feature that is al-enabled: organisations are encouraged to identify those features where providing additional information in this manner will enhance consumer trust. similarly, if al is used in decision-making, information may be provided so that consumers understand how decisions made with the assistance of al may affect them. this can likewise be provided through descriptions of how the service will be provided: for al-enabled features that consumers interact with regularly, providing information so that understand why the al-enabled feature is behaving in a certain way, and providing preference settings to allow consumers some influence over future behaviour where possible. as doing so requires more engineering effort (such as in the providing additional user interfaces to user history), and the level of information provided may be somewhat more detailed and personalised than feature descriptions, organisations will have to decide which of their product features will benefit from provision of this level of detail: d. for al-augmented decisions that affect consumers, consider providing additional information so that understand why the decisions were made; and for certain categories of such decisions, providing an appropriate channel to contest such decisions: the level of information that is provided will necessarily be detailed but this may not be necessary except for those scenarios where a customer is affected by the decision: they they they

model artificial intelligence governance framework  a feedback channels this channel could be used for customers to raise feedback or raise queries: it could be managed by an organisation's data protection officer (""dpo"") if this is appropriate. where customers find inaccuracies in their personal data which has been used for decisions affecting them, this channel can also allow them to correct their data such correction and feedback, in turn, maintain data veracity: it could also be managed by an organisation's   quality service manager  (""qsm"") if stakeholders wish to raise feedback and queries on material inferences made about them: b_ decision review apart from existing review channels obligations, organisations can consider providing an avenue for individuals (such as an aggrieved consumer) to request a review of material al decisions that have affected them: where the effect of a fully-autonomous decision on a consumer may be material, it would be reasonable to provide an opportunity for the decision to be reviewed by a human: testing the user interface . organisations are encouraged to test user interfaces and address usability problems before deployment, so that the user interface serves its intended purposes: if applicable, organisations are also encouraged to inform individuals that their responses would be used to train the al system a chatbot) organisations should be aware of the risks of using such responses as some individuals may intentionally use bad language or random replies' which would affect the training of the al system: easy-to-understand communications . organisations are encouraged to communicate in an easy-to- understand manner to increase transparency: there are existing tools to measure readability, such as the readability graph , the gunning index, the flesch-kincaid readability tests, etc: it would be helpful for decisions with higher impact to be communicated in an easy-to-understand manner; with the need to be transparent about the technology being used: besides textual communications, organisations can also consider visualisation tools, graphical representations, summary tables, or a combination of these. the  priority is to convey your information, such as an explanation or interpretation, in a way that is understandable by an organisation's consumers and other stakeholders. (e.g. fry fog using



 acceptable user policies . in certain cases, organisations may be implementing al-powered solutions that are also trained on real-life input data (i.e. active learning). these organisations may wish to consider setting out certain acceptable user policies (""aups"") to ensure that users do not   maliciously introduce  input data that unacceptably manipulates the performance andlor results of the solution's model: this is pertinent, given examples of al chatbot systems that have been unduly manipulated to issue publicly- unacceptable responses. . in this regard, aups serve to set broad boundaries for the interactions that individuals can perform with the al system, such as restrictions with regard to intentional actions or attempts to reverse engineer; disable, interfere or disrupt the functionality, integrity or performance of the al-powered service. interacting with other organisations . some of the approaches and methodologies described in the preceding section are also relevant when organisations interact with al solution providers (such as procuring al solutions and obtaining regulatory approval) , or other organisations (such as facilitating industry collaboration, enabling interoperability of systems). organisations would thus need to obtain sufficient information from al solution providers to help them meet their business objectives (for example, this could be a back-to-back arrangement for providing the information described in paragraph .). this could be as straightforward as obtaining the al solution providers' support to provide the information"" and to build the features"" necessary such that the deploying organisation can align itself to the model framework: for example, information related to lineage of the training dataset and documenting the steps in the model training and selection process for example, the user-facing interactions providing information about the expected behavior of an al-powered feature and building the function to allow users to manage preference settings that influence how the al-powered feature will perform for them in future: past key



model artificial intelligence governance framework  . organisations may have to consider the level of support and detailed information that may need to obtain from al solution providers pertaining to: a data (e.g: types and range of data used in training the algorithm, source and quality of external training data); b model training and selection (e.g. features and variables used and weights of the commercial models supplied, documenting the decisions made with respect to the model training and selection); c human elements nature of human involvement in developing the algorithm, or in the decision-making process); d. inferences (e.g: predictions made by the algorithm and how these are incorporated into product features or decision- making); e algorithmic presence (e.g: where in the solution that an algorithm is used); and f measures and safeguards in place to mitigate biases in data and algorithms: . depending on the purpose and context, the type and level of detail of information required may be different: for example, a regulator may require a regulated entity to demonstrate that its model development and selection process is sufficiently rigorous, and the al solution provider may be required to provide more information and be involved in the clarification process with the regulator: an industry collaborator; on the hand, may be more concerned with factors pertaining to compatibility and interoperability: ethical evaluation . finally, as ethical standards governing the development and use of al evolve, organisations are encouraged to evaluate whether their al governance practices and processes are in with evolving al standards, and make available the outcome of such evaluations to relevant stakeholders: they key (e.g: line

model artificial intelligence governance framework  annex b algorithm audits 1_ algorithm audits are conducted if it is necessary to discover the actual operations of algorithms comprised in models: this would have to be carried out at the request of a regulator (as part of a forensic investigation) having jurisdiction over the organisation or by an al technology provider to assist its customer organisation which has to respond to a regulator's request: conducting an algorithm audit requires technical expertise which may require engaging external experts the audit report may be beyond the understanding of most individuals and organisations the expense and time required to conduct an algorithm audit should be weighed against the expected benefits obtained from the audit report: ultimately, algorithm audits should normally be used when it is reasonably clear that such an audit will yield clear benefits for an investigation:  the following factors may be relevant when considering an algorithm audit: a the purpose for conducting an algorithm audit: the model framework promotes the provision of information about how al models function as part of explainable ai. before embarking on an algorithm audit, it is advisable to consider whether the information that has already been made available to individuals, other organisations or businesses, and regulators is sufficient credible (e.g: product or service descriptions, system technical specifications, model training and selection records, data provenance record, audit trail): b target audience of audit results. this refers to the expertise required of the target audience to effectively understand the data, algorithm and/or models. the information required by different audience vary: when the audience consists of individuals, providing information on the decision-making process and/or how the individuals' data is used in such processes will achieve the objective of explainable al more efficaciously: when the audience consists of regulators, information relating to data accountability and the functioning of algorithms should be examined first: an algorithm audit can prove how an al model operates if there is reason to doubt the veracity or completeness of information about its operation: c general data accountability: organisations can provide information on how general data accountability is achieved within the organisations this includes all the good data practices described in the model framework under data for model development section such as maintaining data lineage through keeping a data provenance record, ensuring data accuracy, minimising inherent bias in data, splitting data for different purposes, determining data veracity and reviewing and updating data regularly: d. algorithms in al models can be commercially valuable information that can affect market competitiveness. for example, the algorithm may be a trade secret or may embody business rules that are trade secrets: if a technical audit is contemplated, corresponding mitigation measures should also be considered non-disclosure agreements). and (e.g:

introduction our modern society faces many challenges that endanger the survival of humankind such as global environmental problems, growing economic disparity, and the depletion of resources. japan is the first country to tackle social issues confronting a mature society, such as the declining birthrate and aging population, labor shortage, rural depopulation, and increased fiscal spending: artificial intelligence (al) is considered a technology to rescue society from these problems, to address the set  forth in the united nation's   sustainable development goals (sdgs), and to build a sustainable world. with the establishment of society5.' whose purpose is to address social issues and economic  development ai, aims to revitalize its  society and economy, to be an internationally attractive society, and to contribute to the sdgs on a global scale. similar to many other types of science and technology, al will many benefits to society, but its   large impact on society calls for appropriate   development and implementation. in order to avoid or reduce the negative aspects in advance while making effective use of alto benefit society, we should promote, together with the continued research and development (randd) of technologies related to ai, a transformation into an ai-ready society"" where ai can be used effectively and safely: we need to redesign society in every way including japan's human   potential, social  systems, industrial structures, innovation systems, and governance. depending on the researcher; there are various ways of thinking about the definition of ai (artificial intelligence), a central theme of this document; and there is no clear definition at present: for example, the ec high-level expert group defines ai as a system that performs intelligent operations (which may have some autonomy) in response to environment and input. however, the expression ""intelligent operation"" itself is somewhat vague and open for interpretation: also, the ailoo report' published in the united states in  cites nils j. nilsson's definition4 of al as a field of research according to which artificial intelligence is that activity devoted to making machines intelligent,  and intelligence is that quality that enables an entity to function appropriately and with foresight in its environment"" but this definition is also highly ambiguous. in actuality, the vague definition of al within the same report in and of itself has a positive side that is accelerating the study of ai. in light of these circumstances, although there is a certain consensus 0n what to judge as ai or ai technology, it does not appear appropriate at this time to define it more strictly. in addition, various technologies normally called ""al"" are seldom used alone but instead are generally incorporated and used as of an information system. advanced and complex society . is the future society that japan aims following the information society (society .). a society that realizes society . is a sustainable human-centric society that implements ai, iot (internet of things), robotics and other cutting-edge technologies to create unprecedented value, and a wide range of people can realize their own well-being while respecting the well-being of others high-level expert group on artificial intelligence (ai hleg) ""draft ethics guidelines for trustworthy ai"" and 'a definition of a: main capabilities and scientific disciplines' european commission, directorate-general for communication, december . stone, p. et al. artificial intelligence and life . one hundred year study on artificial intelligence: report of the - study panel"" , stanford university, stanford, ca, sept: . nils j. nilsson, the quest for artificial intelligence: history of ideas and achievements, cambridge, uk: cambridge university press, . many key goals japan; using bring great report? part for,



information systems may incorporate a broad range of ai technologies; moreover; they may incorporate technologies reflected in the principles stated in this document: based on these two premises, the principles herein may be regarded as applying to any ""highly complex information systems in general' that include any such technology: given such consideration, we do not define a particular technology o system as ""al"" , but regard al as ""highly complex information systems in general' after discussing some of the impacts  society, we will present a set of a social principles and identify some issues to consider in ai randd and social implementation: in order to make the ensuing society . as effective as possible, it is essential for all relevant stakeholders to cooperate and interact closely with each other:

 basic philosophy ai is expected to contribute significantly to the realization of society .. we consider ai important not oly to return the benefits obtained from the efficiency and convenience of using ai to people and society, but also to use al for the public ofhumanity as a whole, and to ensure global sustainability outlined in the sdgs through qualitative changes in social conditions and true innovation. we believe we should respect the following three values as our philosophy and build a society that pursues their realization. () dignity: a society that has respect for human dignity we should not build a society where humans are overly dependent on ai or where ai is used to control human behavior  through the excessive pursuit of efficiency and convenience. we need to construct a society where human dignity is respected and, by using ai as a tool, a society where people can better demonstrate their various human abilities, show greater creativity, engage in challenging work, and live richer lives both physically and mentally.  diversity and inclusion: a society where people with diverse backgrounds can pursue their own well-being it is both an ideal in the modern world and major challenge to create a society in which people with diverse backgrounds, values and ways of thinking can pursue their own well-being while society creates new value by flexibly embracing them. alis a technology powerful enough to us closer to this ideal. we need to change the nature of society in this way through the appropriate development and deployment of ai  sustainability: a sustainable society we need to use al to create a succession of new businesses and solutions, resolve social disparities, and develop a sustainable society that can deal with issues such as global environmental problems and climate change. japan, as a leading science and technology- oriented   country, has an obligation to strengthen its accumulated scientific and technological resources by utilizing al and thereby contributing to the creation of such a sustainable society. good bring



 social changes needed to realize_society .  al-ready society"" technologies  expected to contribute to the realization of society . include ai; iot, robotics, and ultra-high-speed broadband communication networks. even if it becomes possible to some extent to entrust complex processes to machines using ai, it is still necessary for humans to set objectives that answer the question ""what are we ai for?"" while ai can be used to better society, it might also be used for undesirable purposes or in inappropriate ways unconsciously. for this reason; we are advancing technological developments in terms of   human potential, social systems, industrial structures, innovation systems; and governance which can answer the question ""what are we using ai for?"" while paying close attention to their interaction with the progress of technology these five aspects are equally important in achieving society .. human potential in an ""ai-ready society"" that is responsive to the spread of al to every corner of society, how human respond to ai is the to realizing society where al can be utilized. to that end, the expected abilities and roles of people are as follows a) people should fully understand the advantages and disadvantages of ai. in particular; people should have the ability to recognize that biases are included in the algorithms andlor data that will become the information resources of ai, and for example, that these biases may be used for undesirable purposes. in addition, people should recognize that there are three types of data bias: statistical bias, bias caused by social conditions, and bias arising from malicious intent among ai users. b) it is preferred that the use of al will create an environment in which many people can engage in highly creative and productive work. to that end, it is expected that a diverse range of people will acquire the ability to realize their own dreams and ideas with als support despite many differences in origin, culture, taste, and so on. an education system that achieves these as well as social systems that contribute to their achievement must be realized. it is important to have sufficient human resources  with acquired application skills such as implementation and design of ai systems and basic knowledge of data and ai: these skills would be acquired in cross-disciplinary range of fields in combined and  integrated framework it is expected that such human resources will be the driving force of all activities in society, and that the capabilities of those people will contribute to the formation of an al-based environment. given the establishment of such a environment we must implement social systems that allow many people to live a richer and more fulfilling life. ) social systems the use of ai will most likely accelerate the evolution of individual service solutions and create various benefits from improved efficiency and individualization. in order to embrace the full benefits of this change in society, it is necessary for entire social systems including health care, finance, insurance, transportation, energy, and others to flexibly change and respond to the evolution of ai this includes simple efficiency in light of existing socially accepted objectives (such as improved convenience and liberation from simple labor tasks) it also includes the realization of new value potentially created by diversification and fluidization of objectives and resolving negative outcomes such as inequality, widening disparity, social exclusion, and so on) that may result from the evolution of ai. to this end; we need to implement flexible architecture designs equipped with mechanisms for expandability, interoperability, developing improved social order; and s0 on, both in the software and the hardware aspects of each social additionally, we need to establish common data  using beings key - fully goals living living system:



utilization   infrastructure for various  social systems, in particular to ensure interoperability and connectivity: ) industrial structures in order for a diverse group of people to realize their assorted dreams and ideas, it is necessary for labor as well as employment and entrepreneur environments to be flexible and internationally open: for this reason, companies   should compete  fairly and promote  flexible  working styles, human creativity   should  continually be demonstrated   throughout  industries,  and investment in startup businesses should be promoted: innovation systems (environments that support innovation) it is necessary for universities, research institutions, industries, and the public at large to  participate in ais randd, utilization and evaluation across fields and  positions, stimulating each other; and creating an environment in which innovation can flourish: to that end, all types of data including real space data should be instantaneously and securely available at a level that al can analyze. additionally, it is advisable to ensure privacy and security so that everyone can provide and distribute data with ease, and for there to be an environment where they can benefit from the data that they have provided it is   advisable to accelerate the   desired   development of ai by establishing an environment in which those involved in randd; including users, can safely conduct randd and utilization of ai, and the of randd and utilization can move rapidly. preferably, the utilization of al will create new ideas and possibilities, and significantly expand the potential of innovation. governance it is always necessary to continue to update the content and defined purposes discussed in the above-mentioned sections human potential, social systems, industrial structures, and innovation systems in line with social changes and technological developments. for that reason, it is necessary to have a system that can be implemented and in place for various stakeholders, including government; industry, universities, research institutions, and the general public. then will be able to work together on such matters as identifying issues, evaluating impacts, and making decisions  regulatory governance including rules, systems, standardization and codes of conduct: additionally, it is necessary to listen to people, including those who have a difficult time having their opinions heard, in addition the various stakeholders, and to establish system that continuously addresses the most advanced social and technical issues. when implementing such governance, flexible and effective measures should be taken not only in terms of the law but also by means of industries with appropriate technical means taking the initiative. in addition, international coordination for governance is important, and in addition to governance in each individual country, an international system of cooperation for dealing with cross-border problems should be established. cycle they



social principles_of human-centric ai we recognize that in order to realize an ai-ready society"" and to promote an appropriate and proactive social implementation of ai, it is important to establish basic principles that each stakeholder should keep in mind. in order for ai to be accepted and properly used by society, we will systemize these basic principles into ""social principles of al"" to which society (especially state legislative and administrative bodies) should pay attention, and ""randd and utilization principles of al"" to which developers and operators engaged in ai randd and social implementation should pay attention: the ""social principles of al"" necessary for realizing a society with the three basic principles listed in section , and the ""randd and utilization principles of ai"" that developers and business operators should consider, are as follows:  social principles of ai social   principles   of ai are principles   relating to social  frameworks that  should be implemented across japanese society including national and local governments as well as in multilateral frameworks in an ai-ready society.' () the human-centric principle the utilization of al must not infringe upon the fundamental human rights guaranteed by the constitution and international standards. ai should be developed, utilized, and implemented in society to expand the abilities of people and allow diverse people to pursue their own well-being: in a society making use of ai, it is desirable that we introduce appropriate mechanisms for literacy education and for the promotion of proper use of ai s0 that people do not become over-dependent on ai or misuse ai to manipulate other people's decision-making: ai can expand human abilities and creativity not only by replacing aspects ofhuman labor but also by assisting humans as a technologically advanced tool. when using ai, people must judge and decide for themselves how to use it. the appropriate stakeholders involved in the development, delivery and utilization of ai should be responsible for the consequences of ai utilization, depending on the nature of the problem: in the process of ai deployment, each stakeholder should take into consideration the user-friendliness of the system in order to allow all people to enjoy the benefits of ai and avoid creating a digital divide with so-called ""information or ""technology poor"" people left behind: the principle of education/literacy in a society premised on ai, we do not desire to create disparities or divisions between people o create those who are socially disadvantaged. therefore, policy makers and managers of businesses involved in ai must have an accurate understanding of ai, knowledge and ethics permitting appropriate use of al in society: they should take into account the complexity of al and appreciate the possibility that ai could be intentional poor""



misused. ai users should have a general understanding of ai and should acquire sufficient education to use it   properly,  given that ai platforms are much more complicated than already developed conventional tools. regarding developers of ai, meanwhile, it is of course necessary for them to master the basics of al technology: additionally, from the viewpoint of developing ai that is useful to society, it is important for developers to learn business models for how al can be used in society, as well as to master a wide range of liberal arts such as social sciences and ethics including normative consciousness. from this point of view, we believe that an educational environment that fosters education and literacy in accordance with the following principles must be provided equally to all people. in  order to prevent generating disparities between people or to create socially vulnerable individuals, opportunities for education in a wide range of literacy skills are to be   provided in  early  childhood education and  primary and  secondary education. opportunities are also to be provided for the reeducation of working adults and the elderly: with regard to literacy education and skills required to use ai, ur society needs an educational system that allows anyone to acquire the basics of mathematics, and data   science. all people need to learn beyond the boundaries of literature and science. it is also necessary to prepare content in literacy education on the limits of security and ai technology in order to raise awareness of ai and data characteristics. these characteristics include bias in data, the possibility of causing bias depending on how ai is used, and issues of fairness, impartiality, and privacy protection that are inherently needed in the use of ai: in a society where ai is pervasive, it is to be  expected that the educational environment will change from the current unilateral and uniform teaching style to one that makes use of individual interests and skill sets. for that reason, society as whole shares a sense that the education system is always changing flexibly to the optimal   form of teaching regardless of previous successful experiences in the educational environment to date. in education; it is desirable to have an interactive educational environment for the prevention of dropouts and an environment that fully utilizes ai technologies to allow students to work together: it is desirable not to impose an unnecessary burden only on the administration or schools (teachers), but to work independently with private enterprises and citizens toward the development of such an educational environment: the principle of privacy protection not all ai technologies increase the risk associated with the use of personal data, but in a society premised on a, it is still possible to gauge each person's political position, economic situation, personal hobbies, personal preferences, and so forth with great accuracy based on data about matters such as data subject's individual behavior. this means, when utilizing ai, that more careful discretion may be required than the mere handling of personal data in accordance with the level of importance and sensitivity of the data. each stakeholder must handle personal data based on the following principles to ensure that no individuals are disadvantaged from the unexpected distribution or use  ai,



of personal data in undesirable ways. we should make sure that any ai using personal data and any service solutions that use al, including use by the government, do not infringe on a person's individual freedom, dignity or equality. ifthe use of ai threatens to increase the possibility ofharming individuals, technical mechanisms and non-technical frameworks should be developed to reduce the risk: in particular; al using personal data should have mechanisms to ensure accuracy and legitimacy, and to allow individuals to be substantially involved in managing the privacy of their personal data. this would make it possible for people to provide personal data with peace of mind when ai, and effectively benefit from the data they provide. personal data must be protected appropriately according to its degree of importance and sensitivity: personal data   contains a variety f information, ranging from matters that are highly likely to have a influence on an individual's rights and interests  (these  would typically be personal  thoughts, beliefs, medical history, criminal records, and s0 on), to matters that are semi-public in nature in a person's social life. keeping this in mind, we need to pay close attention to the balance between the use of, and need for protection 0f, personal data based on the cultural background and common understanding of society. the principle of ensuring security the active use of al automates social systems and greatly improves safety. on the other hand, at least within the scope of currently available technologies, it is not always possible for ai to respond appropriately to rare events or deliberate attacks_ therefore, the use of ai poses a new set of risks to security. society should always be aware of the balance between the benefits and risks, and endeavor to improve social safety and sustainability as whole. society must promote broad, deep research and development related to ai (from immediate measures to deep essential understanding) , such as the proper assessment of risks in the utilization of a[ and research to reduce risks. society must make firm efforts to conduct risk management including the safeguard of cybersecurity. society should always pay attention to sustainability in the use of ai society, in particular; must not be uniquely dependent on just one type of al or a few specific types of ai. the principle of fair competition fair competitive environment must be maintained in order to create new businesses and services, to maintain sustainable economic growth, and to present solutions to social challenges. even if resources related to al are concentrated in a specific country, we must not have a society where unfair data collection and infringement of sovereignty are performed under that country's dominant position: even if resources related to al are concentrated into specific companies, we must using great many



not have a society where unfair data collection and unfair competition take place their dominant position: the use of ai should not generate a situation where wealth and social influence are unfairly biased towards certain stakeholders: the principle of fairness, accountability, and transparency in an ""ai-ready society"" it is necessary to ensure fairness  and transparency in decision-making, appropriate accountability for the results, and trust in the technology; so that people who use ai are not subject to undue discrimination with regard to personal background, or to unfair treatment in terms of human dignity. under ais   design   concept; all   people are treated fairly   without   unjustified discrimination on the   grounds  of diverse  backgrounds such as race, gender; nationality, age, political beliefs, religion, and so on. appropriate explanations should be given on a case-by-case basis depending on the application of al and each particular situation, including such things as when al is used, how the ai data is obtained and used, and what measures have been taken to ensure the appropriateness of results obtained from al operations. in order for people to understand ais proposals and make judgments on them, there should be appropriate opportunities for an open dialogue, as required, regarding the use, adoption, and operation of ai taking into account the above viewpoints and in order to use al safely in society, mechanism must be   established to ensure trust   in ai, and in the data and algorithms that support it the principle of innovation to realize society . and aim for continuous innovation that advances as people evolve together with ai development; we   should transcend boundaries   such as national borders, industries, academia, governments, race, gender; nationality, age, political convictions and religion: we should promote total globalization, diversification; and industry-academia-government   cooperation in both human resources and research, based on a wide range ofknowledge, perspectives, ideas, and so on we must promote equal collaboration among universities, research institutions and companies, and the flexible movement of human resources. to implement ai efficiently and safely in society, methods for confirming the quality and reliability of ai, and for efficient collection and maintenance of data used by ai must be promoted. in addition to establishing al engineering such as methods for the development; and operation of ai,it is necessary to promote the establishment and development of a wide range of studies such as ethical and economic aspects of ai. to ensure the sound development of al technology, while securing privacy and  using being testing



security, it is necessary to establish a platform environment where data from all fields can be effectively utilized across national borders without monopolized. in addition, to promote research on ai, randd environments should be established where computer resources and high-speed networks that promote international collaboration and accelerate al are shared and used. the government must proceed with regulatory reforms to reduce impeding factors in all related fields in order to establish an efficient and beneficial society with the aid of ai technologies  airandd and utilization principles we believe that developers and business operators of al should establish and comply with the ai development and utilization principles based on the fundamental philosophy and social principles of al outlined above. since many countries, organizations, companies, and so on are currently discussing ai development and utilization principles, we believe it is important to create an international consensus  quickly through open  discussions, and share results   internationally in a non- regulatory, non-binding framework:  conclusion in order to lead the world in building the first al-ready society,"" japan should share the principles herein with the government, related industries, organizations, and so 0n, and reflect them in government policies. in addition, japan should share these principles with other countries around the world and take a leadership role in international discussions with the of establishing an al-ready society worldwide. in doing so, japan should present to the world a social image of society . that supports the realization of the sdgs, and should contribute to cooperative and creative new development of the international community. these principles should be flexibly revised in the future according to the progress of ai- related technologies, social changes, changes in the world situation, and many other factors  being goal

national ai strategy roadmap for the philippines introduction the fourth industrial revolution (fire) is set to transform industries at an unprecedented rate. it is a disruption that will change everything from products and processes to design philosophies and business models_a multifaceted  phenomenon   involving technology, people, and the environment. fire is supported by nine main technological pillars: big data and analytics; simulations, system integration, internet of things (lot), autonomous robots, cloud computing; cybersecurity, augmented reality (ar); and additive manufacturing: artificial intelligence (ai) has been projected to drive % of fire, with blockchain and cloud computing accounting for the other %. in fact, according to pwc's recent report; al could contribute a whopping uss15. trillion to the economy by . in southeast asia, mckinsey reports that al could be seen to open up opportunities in the region in that it could ""automate about % of the work activities performed in asean's four biggest economies; which include the philippines. furthermore, in an october  report by edbi and kearney, al is expected to boost southeast asia's gdp by up to uss1 trillion by  while al will uplift the philippine gdp by % in  equivalent to uss92 billion. in this light; a strong focus on al has significant potential to uplift the lives of filipinos, local industries, and the national economy it is no question that al can be expected to revolutionize many mundane aspects of our daily lives within the next decade  for one, the automotive industry will most likely be able to practically perfect autonomous vehicle  technology: the   synchronization of   vehicle movements will be straightforward, and it can be expected that tratfic congestion will be addressed and alleviated even in developing countries like the philippines: al-driven precision farming can also drastically decrease losses due to pests, and natural disasters, and can significantly increase outputs of high value products per hectare of land: having the right people and technology to handle the above concerns will not only allow wealth generation but also ensure inclusivity, as these will address the need for shared basic infrastructure that citizens need to be productive and contented: housing; transportation; and food security, among others: al is fueled by randd and innovation: hence, the philippines benefits from favorable changes in the local innovation and startup ecosystem. in , the local startup ecosystem ranked 54th out of  countries, an increase of  places from . in , the philippines rose to the rank out of  economies (up from 54th in ) in the annual global innovation index (gii), which has put the country in the  best-ranked lower middle-income economies # out of ). data executive survey "", newvantage partners llc, .  iiwww pwc com/gxlenlissuesldata-and-analyticslpublicationslartificial-intelligence-study html edbi; artificial intelligence could deliver a uss1 trillion to southeast asia's gdp by ""_ accessed from:  com/news-room/latest-newslartificial-intelligence-could-deliver-a-us1-trillion-uplift-to-southeast-asia- s-gdp-by- edbi and kearney, ""racing towards the future: artificial intelligence in southeast asia"", . pricewaterhousecoopers philippines, ""charging ahead: philippine startups break boundaries"" .  iiwwwpwc com/phlen/ceo-survey//pwcph-start up survey_2020 pdf global 50th top ""big uplift

national ai strategy roadmap for the philippines barriers to al adoption amongindustries in the philippines most enterprises and c-level executives worldwide are already largely cognizant of al's enormous impact on their business processes and products, but the philippines is slow in this realization and its embrace of al: to address these, the major barriers to al adoption for most organizations and enterprises in the philippines have been identified, as follows:  lack of understanding of data science and ai. organizations in the philippines still have   insufficient   knowledge of what al and data science are_ hence, cannot conceptualize how this new technology and set of tools can help their business processes and products: critically, are not willing to invest  money and other resources into something whose value and impact are not explicit nor tangible to them. among those with a degree of familiarity to al, concern about employee backlash due to the pace of change and job displacement tends to be an inhibitory factor. () lack of knowledge on potential use cases. perhaps another reason local industries and other organizations lack an understanding of the field of analytics is the scarcity of information on potential use cases of al. while many concrete examples exist outside of the philippines that are readily accessible via the news and from online resources, many local enterprises cannot connect or relate to these examples. many still seem far-fetched to local enterprises and the workforce. there is a need more potential use cases that are locally generated, so as to paint a more compelling picture for local stakeholders: () lack of resources. the lack of  resources is categorized into two forms: equipment (computational resources) and manpower (human resources). first, many enterprises, mostly micro, small, and medium enterprises (msmes) in the philippines are resource-challenged in terms of the capability to set up their own computational resource, including cloud computing resource, andlor even acquire business intelligence (bl) software to aid them in their data and system analysis second, most, if not all, industries in the country, especially those that have started to invest in al and data science, have been restricted by the scarcity of data experts, which include data analysts, data scientists, machine learning engineers, data engineers, data architects, and data stewards, among others furthermore, many of the data-skilled talents lack the required business skills to make al randd projects practical and profitable for the enterprises. lack of data strategy. data   strategy or al strategy is  essentially a vision for how organizations should invest their resources towards building capabilities in data science and al, anchored particularly on each company's strategic imperatives and business objectives. a common  misunderstanding is that a data strategy is all just about the data and the technology u e.g,, howlwhat to collect; where to store, what bl platforms to use, etc. rather , it is about acquiring technologies and technical capabilities can help enterprises achieve their strategic it is potentially disastrous when   organizations pour significant investments into digitization without charting their data/al strategy in alignment with their own many they they how goals.



national ai strategy roadmap for the philippines corporate vision. this  could result  in enormous monetary and opportunity losses: this particular barrier is more prevalent in large enterprises that have the financial capacity to invest in digitization, which include the capability to solve use cases with ml, but do not have the right people who are both technically and business savvy to bridge the gap between technology and business: () uncertainties about  legal and regulatory framework for al. by  setting out ethical boundaries to prevent indiscriminate and non-rights-respecting al applications and protections for both customers and businesses, a clear legal and regulatory framework for al will both protect the rights of filipinos and spur responsible adoption of and innovations in al. however, at the present, the philippines lacks a complete framework for such: indeed, as far as al has been in the public statements of lawmakers, more emphasis has been placed on its potential disruptive effects such as job losses, especially in the financially important bpo sector: fortunately, one component of the framework is currently present: the data privacy act of  (republic act no. ) , modelled after the european union's general data protection regulation, offers robust protections for data privacy: filling in the missing pieces of the puzzle is now the next step.



national ai strategy roadmap for the philippines thenational al strategy in , the philippine congress championed the approval of the philippine innovation act (republic act no. ) , aiming to fund and support randd efforts in the country towards national development: the act's main objective is ""to generate and scale up actions in all levels and areas of education, training; research, and development towards promoting innovation and internationalization activities of micro, small and medium enterprises as drivers of sustainable and inclusive growth.' consistent  with the law; the national artificial  intelligence (ai) strategy roadmap was formulated to guide government and private sector stakeholders in employing al technologies and developing al economies, while being mindful of the potential consequences and impacts of algorithms to processes and business models: its overall focus is on how al can be used to uplift the filipino people, improve the productivity of local industries, and enhance the competitiveness of the national economy: among the roadmap's main objectives are: . to maintain the regional and global competitiveness of filipino industries, noting that al is one of the biggest drivers of innovation for enterprises;  to identify areas (in both randd and technology application) for investing both time and resources of government; industry, and society, which includes harnessing existing global knowledge and new technologies that will aid in the development of new processes, products, and services for increasing productivity and for promoting overall public welfare;  to recommend ways for effectively fostering a triple-helix (randd) collaboration among government; industry, and the academe, which is essential to national development; 4_ to suggest approaches for preparing the future workforce for the jobs of the future; and . to attract the biggest industries to set shop in the country, and thus generating more jobs for the filipino people. the roadmap is organized according to pillars () , strategic dimensions (), strategic imperatives () , and strategic tasks (). the pillars and dimensions have been defined so as to ensure that the country has clear metrics in terms of tracking the progress of its implementation towards transforming the philippines into a globally competitive al-driven economy: it is divided into two pillars based on the structure of the global al index (gaii).  the first pillar is implementation which reflects the   operationalization of al by   practitioners in business, government and communities. the second pillar is innovation which reflects  technology the global al index. accessible at:  iiwww tortoisemedia com/intelligencelglobal-ail: key



national al strategy roadmap for the philippines breakthroughs and advancements in methodology that are indicative of greater capacity for al in the future. strategic dimensions comprise each pillar the first dimension is digitization and infrastructure as it is critical in achieving all the strategic goals defined in this roadmap. the second dimension is research and development that includes as subset 'investing in strategic sectors"" and 'international collaboration.' the third dimension is the workforce, which focus on anticipating and preparing for the potential impact of al technologies by ensuring enough talents and skilled practitioners that can deliver al solutions (more on application and implementation) and perform al research (academic and industry-driven): this dimension will also cover both reskilling and upskilling of the workforce. finally, the fourth dimension is regulation, which protects human rights and puts into place equitable al activating opportunities. digitalization and infrastructure; workforce development, and regulation fall under the implementation pillar of the roadmap, while research and development is under the innovation pillar. each of the   strategic dimensions consists of   strategic   imperatives. for digitization and infrastructure, these are to () build a robust connected and networked environment; and () improve data access and data value  extraction: for workforce development, ()  transform education and nurture future al talents, and () upskill and reskill the workforce. for regulation; () build an al ecosystem conscience. and lastly for research and development; () master and boundaries of al, and () accelerate innovation with al by helping industries innovate through al randd, supporting and nurturing al startups, and transforming institutions to maximize the impact of al randd: pillars strategic dimensions strategic imperatives strategic tasks build robust networked environment: digitization and infrastructure improve data access and data value extraction. nurture future al talents: implementation workforce development upskill and reskill workforce. regulation develop an al economy conscience accelerate innovation with al: innovation research + development master and push the boundaries of al: fig . national al strategy pillars, dimensions, imperatives, tasks push

introduction iti aayog released the national strategy for n artificial  intelligence (nsai) discussion paper in june , in pursuance of the mandate entrusted to it by the hon'ble finance minister in the budget speech of  . nsai while highlighting the potential of artificial intelligence (ai) for   accelerating   growth also emphasised the social potential of large scale adoption of al with a focus on themes of inclusivity, adopting the theme of al for all' . towards promoting development as well as adoption of al, the nsai made broad recommendations for supporting and nurturing an al ecosystem in india under four heads, (a) promotion of research; (b) skilling and reskilling of the workforce; (c) facilitating the adoption of al solutions; and (d) the development of guidelines for 'responsible al' . while underlining the role of private sector and collaboration, nsai identified focus sectors where the government was expected to play the lead, viz. health, education, agriculture, smart cities and mobility: nsai recommended establishment of clear mechanisms to ensure that the technology is used in a responsible manner by instilling trust in their functioning as a critical enabling factor for large scale adoption in a manner that harnesses the best that the technology has to offer while protecting citizens need for a fine balance between protecting society (individuals and communities) without stifling research and innovation in the field was underlined: the future of al is determined by a diverse group of stakeholders, including researchers, private organisations, government; standard-setting bodies, regulators and  general citizens: around the world, various countries and organisations have defined principles to guide responsible management of al for various stakeholders. 'towards the development of responsible 'al for all' , proposes principles for the responsible management of al systems that may be leveraged by relevant stakeholders in india. case studies of al systems in india and around the  key



world are studied and the principles for responsible al are derived from the constitution of india and various laws enacted thereunder: the case studies and considerations in this paper are limited in context to 'narrow al' solutions. have been grouped into two broad buckets: 'systems considerations' arising as a result of the system design choices and deployment processes, and have the potential to impact stakeholders interacting with a al system; and 'societal' considerations, that are broader   ethical challenges pertaining to risks arising out of the very usage of al solutions for functions, and have potential repercussions on the society beyond the stakeholder interacting directly with specific systems. the paper examines following system considerations: lack of understanding an al system's functioning makes it difficult to reliably and safely deploy al systems challenges in  explaining specific  decisions of al systems makes it difficult to trust them inherent bias could make the decisions prejudiced against segments of population potential for exclusion of citizens in al systems used for delivering important services and benefits difficulty in assigning accountability privacy risks security risks; and following societal considerations: impact on jobs malicious psychological profiling the supreme court of india, in various cases such as naz foundation and navtej johar has defined the prevailing morality of our country to be based on the principle of constitutional morality: the supreme court has stressed time and on adherence to constitutional morality over social morality, with the formers reach extending beyond the mere text of the constitution to encompassing the values of a diverse and inclusive society while remaining faithful to other constitutional principles the   paper studies the various  they specific specific again



considerations under the lens of the constitutions and identifies 'principles for responsible management of artificial intelligence in india' . on the basis of systems and societal considerations, the paper identifies the following broad principles for responsible management of al:  _ principle of safety and reliability   principle of equality 3_ principle of inclusivity and non-discrimination 4_ principle of privacy and security 5_ principle of transparency 6_ principle of accountability 7_ principle of protection and reinforcement of positive human values the manner and degree of implementation of principles must provide an enabling environment for promoting a responsible al ecosystem in india. the measures may be suitably calibrated according to the risk associated with different al applications in a manner that keeps pace with technology advances: this is an evolving area of work: niti aayog is already working on part- of the paper that would provide the approach towards ongoing update of principles and enforcement mechanisms of the responsible al in the sector; private sector and academia. this paper is expected to be released shortly: consider this document to be a critical step towards #alforail and hope it starts a dialogue on ensuring that the significant and transformative potential of artificial intelligence is used for the benefit of indian citizens and humanity overall amitabh kant ceo, niti aayog specific public wm)



the need for responsible ai 



the need for responsible al rtificial intelligence (al) systems have gained prominence over the last decade due to their vast potential to unlock economic value and help mitigate social challenges: thus not only the development but also adoption of al has seen a global surge in recent years it is estimated that al has the potential to add usd  billion, or  percent of current gross value added to india's economy in . it is projected, that the al software market will reach usd  billion by , up from usd . billion in . the rapid increase in adoption can also be attributed to the strong value proposition of the technology: the national strategy for artificial intelligence (nsai) has successfully brought al in the centre-stage of the reform agenda of the government by underlining its potential to improve outcomes in sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, or education. role that al plays in facilitating improved scale of delivery of specialized services (remote diagnosis or precision agriculture advisory) and improved inclusive access to government welfare services (regional language chatbots or voice interfaces)   implies a whole new for  government interventions in these sectors. further the nsai underlines the need for a robust ecosystem that facilitates cutting edge research to not only solve for these societal problems and serve as the test bed of al innovations but at the same time enable india to take a strategic global leadership by scaling these solutions globally: as these factors continue to favour the increased application of al to a variety of private and use cases, it is expected that al usage will become ingrained and integrated with society: in india, large scale applications of al are being trialled everyday across sectors? . in uttar pradesh, for example, , cctv rewire for growth: accelerating india's economic growth with al, accenture ()  artificial intelligence market forecasts omdia; dc futurescape: worldwide it industry  predictions   gov.in/case-studies path public



cameras were installed for the 'prayagraj kumbha mela' in . the cameras would raise an alert when the crowd density exceeded a threshold, and the connected integrated command and control centres provided the security authorities with relevant information'. wadhwani al is testing an al-powered smartphone-based anthropometry tool that will empower health workers to screen low-birth-weight babies without any specialised equipments. niramai, a startup, has developed an early-stage breast cancer detection system using a portable, non-invasive, non-contact al-based device. researchers from iit madras are looking to use al to predict the risk of expectant mothers dropping out of healthcare programmes, to improve targeted interventions and increase positive healthcare outcomes for mothers and infants? . box : artificial intelligence in this document, the scope and definition of al is similar to the one mentioned in the national strategy for al,  (nsai, )- a constellation of technologies that enable machines to act with higher levels of intelligence and emulate the human capabilities of sense, comprehend and act: computer vision and audio processing can actively perceive the world around them by acquiring and processing images, sound and the natural language processing and inference engines can enable al systems to analyse and understand the information collected. an al system can also take decisions through inference engines or undertake actions in the physical world. these capabilities are augmented by the ability to learn from experience and keep adapting over time. this paper studies the ethical implications of 'narrow al' , which is a broad term given to al systems that are designed to solve challenges that would ordinarily require domain experts both systems and societal considerations are explored from the perspective ofnarrow al only: broader ethical implications of 'artificial general intelligence' (agi) or artificial super intelligence' (asi) are not considered in this paper: further; systems considerations considered in this document mainly arise from decisions taken by algorithms: artificial intelligence real showstopper of kumbh mela    /wwwwadhwaniai.org/work/maternal-newborn-child-health/  /wwwniramai.com/  // dia-.html speech. specific 



while the potential of these solutions to improve productivity, efficiency and outcome is well established, the nsai () also advocated for managing the al systems responsibly: around the world, instances of harm caused by deployment of al systems have been realised: al systems appear to have prejudices in certain decisions and this amplified when used in large scale, such as when the system to allocate healthcare in the usa was found to discriminate against black people8. the blackbox nature of a/ and its 'self-learning' ability make it difficult to justify its decisions and in apportioning liability for errors. al systems often lack transparency and the user is unaware that are dealing with a chatbot or an automated decision-making system, this awareness being to build trust with the user: safety and robustness of al systems can pose serious challenges especially in high risk prone applications; unequal access to al powered applications for marginalized populations can further accentuate digital divide. according to a capgemini report, % of the  surveyed organisations in india have encountered ethical concerns from the use of a/"". there are also concerns of al systems leading to job loss due to automation: the usage of al for malicious intent for e.g: fakes to create misinformation have shown to have serious repercussions on society with instances of al system enabled targeted propaganda, leading to social discord. the risks ofnot managing al systems responsibly also has a significant economic impact  multiple firms placed a moratorium on facial recognition technology after   issues   around bias  against  specific  population  groups   emerged? . a survey by capgemini shows that ethical al interactions drive customer trust and satisfaction- with al systems that are seen as ethical have a  net-promoter-score (nps) advantage over the ones that are not: over % executives agreed that it is important to ensure that al systems are ethical and % of senior executives report to have abandoned an al system due to ethical  concerns_ this paper aims to study the risks from the use of al systems in india and around the world: in this regard, the impact of al systems may broadly be divided into following two groups:  /wwwnature com/articles/d41586---   com/articles////ibm-quits-facial-recognition.aspx .  /www capgemini com/wp-content/uploads///a-in-ethics_web-pdf  gets they key deep point



a_ direct impacts-defined as the implications that are caused due to citizens (or primary affected stakeholders') being subject to decisions of a al system. these   typically result from system design choices, development and deployment  practices and are studied under systems considerations. for example, al for cancer screening needs consideration for the patients privacy in its design b_ indirect impacts-defined as implications caused due to the overall deployment of al solutions in society: this has potential repercussions on society beyond the stakeholder directly interacting with the system and are studied under societal considerations. such considerations may require policy initiatives by the government: this document examines the potential risks, followed by a study of legislative practices and technology approaches of managing them and goes on to recommend principles for responsible management of al systems. the principles are expected to safeguard interest and also promote innovation through increased trust and increased adoption. besides establishment of principles there is a need to formulate enforcement mechanisms that would ensure the   principles are adopted across board, including the sector; private sector and academia in a manner that balances innovation and potential risks. part-ii of the series on responsible al for all will the enforcement mechanisms to translate principles to practice. specific public public explore



exploring the ethical considerations he considerations in this section were chosen on the basis of expert consultations, desk review of examples of al deployment globally, and interviews with agencies deploying al solutions in india. the causes for considerations may be deeply interconnected and, in some cases, partially overlapping: considerations have thus been divided in a manner that identifies distinct risks pose to various stakeholders.  they



systems considerations box : the blackbox problem while the advances in machine learning algorithms and techniques have greatly contributed to higher accuracy, the underlying al systems have also become increasingly opaque: such systems have been successful in using a large number of features to make complex and sometimes consequential decisions but without exposing the underlying rationale. in traditional statistical approaches, human programmers influence the choice of parameters and the mechanism to influence a prediction: in al systems, input to the model (called features) are provided with the correct' output through annotated labels during the training: the al system then identifies the relationship between input features and the labels. understanding this relationship becomes harder as the models become increasingly complex this manifests itself as the inability to fully understand an als decision-making process and the inability to predict the al's decisions or outputs-also known as the black box problem'  the blackbox problem does not exist for all forms of machine learning solutions, and there are means of performing similar functions using more rule-based"" techniques, although the accuracy may be significantly lower the accuracy vs interpretability trade-off has limited the applicability of al systems in several high-stakes decision making: one of the major global research efforts is around identifying models that are highly accurate and explainable.  . bathaee, yavar: the artificial intelligence black box and the failure of intent and causation: harvard journal of law and technology volume , number  spring  .  /arxiv org/pdf/..pdf .  / mil/program/explainable-artificial-intelligence  along



the considerations emerging from this property of  deep learning technology manifest themselves in several ways. for example, it is difficult to establish if an al system can be deployed safely and reliably without understanding and  controlling how it works;   trusting an al system's decision becomes a challenge if there is a disagreement due to lack of explanation; improving a model performance is difficult when the root cause is unknown. systems consideration : understanding the al system's functioning for safe and reliable deployment as mentioned in box , machine   learning models learn by   identifying relationships between input features and output labels. model evaluation is typically done by holding out a portion of the datasets as a test dataset: this may not necessarily reflect the various real world deployment scenarios and when the relationship between the input features and output is not understood, it becomes difficult to predict its performance in a new environment: this makes it difficult to reliably deploy and scale such al systems. the issue its implications while accuracy gives a reasonable the system could pick spurious view into how a system performs, correlations, in the underlying data, understanding decision making leading to accuracy in test process is important to ensure safe datasets but significant errors in and reliable deployment deployment box : wolf or husky? in an example referenced in ribeiro et al,, (),an image classification algorithm performed reasonably well in its prescribed task-classify the image of an animal as either a or a husky: when the model was analysed, it was found that the system was classifying images based on the background and not the animal itself. while the model performed reasonably well on the data used to test- it would clearly not do as well in the real world.   com/cloud-ai-whitepapers/al%2oexplainability%2owhitepaper:pdf . ribeiro, m:, singh, s,, and guestrin, c (, august ). why should trust you?"": explaining the predictions of classifier: retrieved august , , from  org/abs/.  good wolf any

systems consideration : consistency across stakeholders though automated solutions are often expected to introduce  objectivity to decision making, recent cases globally have shown that al solutions have the potential to be 'biased' against sections of society: this can lead to inconsistent output across a diverse demography who are otherwise similarly placed: real life manifestations of such bias tie into historically discriminatory behaviour; where members of a certain caste, class, sex r sexual orientation, among others , are denied  opportunities on the basis of an identifying characteristic even though are completely similar in all ways relevant to the decision being made:"" the emergence of bias in al solutions is attributed to a number of factors from various decisions taken across different stages of the lifecycle and the environment in which the system learns. in more rule-based machine learning techniques, the performance of the al solution is largely dictated by the rules defined by its developers in deep learning methods, the performance of the solution is defined by the data used, models chosen, parameters used, defined, etc, and the inherent complexity of such models makes it difficult to identify sources of bias. while individual human decisions are not without bias, al systems are of particular interest due to their potential to amplify its bias across a larger population due to large-scale deployment: the issue its implications different types of cognitive biases large scale deployment of ai, have been identified and tend leads to a large number of high to be unfair' for certain groups frequency decisions, amplifying (across religion, race, caste_ the impact of unfair bias. gender; genetic diversity); leads to lack of trust and since al systems are designed disruption of social order and trained by humans, based on examples from real-world data, human bias could be introduced into the decision-making process;   edu/blog/techtank////highlights-addressing-fairness-in-the-context-of-artifi- cial-intelligencel  specific they arising goals specific

with the former's reach extending beyond the mere text of the constitution to encompassing the values of a diverse and inclusive society while remaining faithful to other constitutional principles: constitutional  morality has been described as the basis on which the rights of minorities can be in the face of majoritarianism, and is to be followed over societal morality, especially when the latter infringes the basic rights guaranteed by the constitution of india (constitution). box : considerations in the context of constitution of india the considerations mentioned in the previous section also find expression in the constitution under fundamental rights the relevant articles are summarized below, article : right_to_equality the constitution guarantees equal treatment of equally placed persons and groups before the law, and equal protection of the law to all. articles _  and : right against discrimination the constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion, race_ caste, sex, descent, place of birth or residence in matters of education, employment, access to spaces, etc: while the constitution prohibits discrimination based on certain markers, it also provides for positive discrimination in the form of affirmative action: article , while prohibiting discrimination, empowers the government to make provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes, and to make provisions for their admission to educational institutions, whether private, aided or unaided: article : right to _life and healthcare the constitution guarantees the right to life to all persons. various high courts have read the right to healthcare, including the right to avail health insurance, to be part of the right to life. article : right _to _privacy the supreme court has held that the right to privacy is an intrinsic part of  upheld public special



the right to life and guaranteed under article  of the constitution and as part of the freedoms enshrined in part iil thereof. article _38: state directive for economic equality the constitution directs the state to ensure economic welfare of the people and minimise inequalities in income, status, facilities and opportunities, both between individuals and between groups of people. the state is also directed to ensure a wage for all workers, including agricultural workers. tansparency and accountability the supreme court, in its interpretation of the constitution, has held that transparency in decision making is critical even for private institutions. the constitution guarantees accountability of all state action to individuals and groups. box : creation of principles principles were developed after consultation with diverse set of stakeholders al case studies in india and instances of harm caused by al systems around the world were studied to identify around the world relevant considerations in indian context supreme court; in various instances, has defined the prevailing morality of india to rights according to the indian be based on the principle of constitutional morality. principles thus flow from the constitution constitution and all laws enacted thereunder various international bodies such as gpai, unesco, ieee have developed international standards for al standards for ai. for effective global collaboration on al, it is important for india'$ principles to be compatible with relevant international standards ethics is an emerging field and should be an ongoing research the considerations were identified  following several expert interviews and multi-stakeholder workshops with experts from india and globally across and private sectors, start-ups, academia and civil society: the principles may be derived from the constitution and all laws enacted thereunder: the following principles are recommended for the responsible management of artificial intelligence in india and are based on the underlying principle of ensuring al systems are designed in a manner that enables fundamental rights:  liberty living public



1_ principle of safety and reliability: al should be deployed reliably as intended and sufficient safeguards must be placed to ensure the safety of relevant stakeholders. risks to all stakeholders should be minimized and appropriate grievance redressal, care and compensation structures should be in place, in case of any unintended or unexpected harm: the al system needs to be monitored through its lifecycle so it performs in an acceptable manner; reliably, according to the desired goals.  principle of equality: al systems must treat individuals under same circumstances relevant to the decision equally . principle of inclusivity and non-discrimination: al systems should not opportunity to a qualified person on the basis of their identity: it should not deepen the harmful historic and social divisions based on religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth or residence in matters of education, employment; access to spaces, etc: it  should also strive to ensure that unfair exclusion of services or benefits does not happen. in case of an adverse decision, appropriate grievance redressal mechanism should be designed in a manner affordable and accessible to everyone irrespective of their background. . principle of privacy and security: al should maintain privacy and security of data of individuals or entities that is used for training the system: access should be provided only to those authorized with sufficient safeguards. . principle of  transparency: the   design and  functioning of the al system should be recorded and made available for external scrutiny and audit to the extent possible to ensure the deployment is fair; honest, impartial and guarantees accountability: . principle of accountability: aii stakeholders involved in the design, development and deployment of the al system must be responsible for their actions. stakeholders should conduct risk and impact assessments to evaluate direct and indirect potential impact of al systems on end- users, set up an auditing process (internal and if required external) to oversee adherence to principles and create mechanisms for grievance redressal in case of any adverse impact  deny public



. principle of protection and reinforcement of positive human values: al should promote positive human values and not disturb in any way social harmony in community relationships it is important to ensure that these principles are updated in the future to reflect the latest knowledge, innovation and technology advances. a mechanism for the same and a framework for the enforcement of these principles will be in part  of the paper: subsequent versions will also explore policy interventions for responsible ai:  explored specific

appendix  review of global regulatory landscape european union the eus ethics guidelines for trustworthy al is based on an approach founded on fundamental  rights. it offers   sector-agonistic  guidelines that require al practitioners to respect the proportionality between means and ends, and carefully create a balance between competing interests and objectives: it also states that the development; deployment and use of al systems must account for both substantive and procedural fairness. under general data protection regulation,  (gdpr), entities processing personal data or determining the means for the processing of personal data are required to implement technical and organisational measures that ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk involved in processing such personal data these measures include the pseudonymization and encryption of data; preserving the confidentiality, integrity and resilience of processing systems and services; and restoring the availability of, and access to, personal data in a timely manner the eu cybersecurity act,  (cybersecurity act) entrusts the european union agency for cybersecurity (enisa) with the responsibility of developing certification frameworks for cybersecurity, including the development of sectoral frameworks for cybersecurity with regards to products. in a white paper on artificial intelligence, the european commission highlighted the importance of suitably amending the product liability directive to enhance security related aspects for ai. the paper noted that the existing product safety legislation already protects against all kinds of risks arising from the product according to its use, including al products. however; it noted that certain amendments may be introduced in the product liability directive to address risks arising out of new technologies: these amendments   include 



risk assessment; human oversight at the time of design, requirements addressing the risk of faulty data at the design stage and provisions discussing and requesting cooperation between economic operators in the supply chain to ensure that safety standards are adequately preserved. singapore the privacy and security regime in singapore is consolidated under a single law the personal data protection act,  (pdpa) regulating privacy issues in al is rooted in two core data protection principles, consent  obligation and purpose limitation. the personal data protection commission (pdpc) is singapore's data protection regulator pdpc published a revised model artificial intelligence governance framework (framework) in , containing a roadmap for data protection compliance for organizations deploying ai the pdpa also requires an organization to protect personal data in its possession or under its control by employing such reasonable security arrangements' to prevent unauthorized access to data and mitigate   similar risks. these arrangements also intend to cover an assessment of the adequacy of existing safeguards, with the pdpc stressing the importance of covering all foreseeable scenarios that can potentially lead to a data breach/security risk to the personal data. towards this, it proposed a framework that stressed on the importance of having a 'human in the loop' or a 'human over the loop' based on the degree of severity and harm occasioned by the particular processing of personal data. the equivalent  data   protection standard for cross-border transfers is also adopted by the pdpa businesses deploying al systems in a manner that moves personal data from one jurisdiction to another must ensure that the entity receiving such data is bound by a series of safeguards that provide the same standard of data protection as the pdpa itself. the model al governance framework (model framework) , was drafted based on a discussion paper issued by the personal data protection commission and part of singapore's national al strategy. it provides a means for entities . benjamin wong yongquan, 'data privacy law in singapore: the personal data protection act ' [] () international data privacy law  . in the matter of an investigation under section () of the personal data protection act  and l'oreal singa- pore pte: ltd, case no. dp--b3091.

employing al to demonstrate their implementation of the accountability-based practices in data management and protection contained therein. it focuses on prospective accountability by making internal governance processes robust and demonstrating to customers and regulators that the entity has employed practices to foster accountability among the designers and operators of al, and to ensure that the al systems, applications and algorithms are transparent and fair in their operation, while providing information and explanation to consumer about where and how al is being used with respect to their data or services and products made available to them. in , the monetary authority of singapore (mas) published the principles to promote fairness, ethics, accountability and transparency in the use of artificial intelligence and data analytics in singapore's financial sector (feat principles) specifically aimed at the use of al for financial services: the feat principles have identified the proactive disclosure of the use of artificial intelligence and data analytics (aida) to data subjects as a principle to ensure transparency in the context of data protection for ai usa the us government; through executive order  in february , issued a series of directions to various federal stakeholders to develop and principles that  promote advancement of al based  technology while also protecting civil liberties. pursuant to this executive order; the white house in january , issued a set of  'principles for the stewardship of al applications, which called for; among others, fairness and non-discrimination to be priorities for agencies drafting and implementing regulations on al. unlike singapore and the eu, the us lacks an overarching federal legislation on privacy: however; various sector laws regulate aspects of privacy: the state of california, which has recognized privacy as a constitutional right, enacted a comprehensive legislation , the california consumer  privacy act,  (ccpa) providing for certain safeguards that directly affect al systems. like singapore and eu, businesses deploying al systems would be obligated to notify users of the purposes of such processing with users being able to withdraw their consent from such processing: .  l/ai.bsa.org/wp-contentluploads///model-al-framework-first-edition-pdf .  / ligencel .  /  key policies top specific



appendix  model transparency mechanisms model cards google released the model card toolkit, a toolset designed to facilitate al model transparency reporting for developers, regulators, and downstream users: it's based on google's model cards framework, which provide a structured framework for reporting on ml model provenance, usage, and ethics-informed evaluation and give a detailed overview of a models suggested uses and limitations that can benefit developers,  regulators, and  downstream users alike.  model cards are aimed at both experts and non-experts. developers can use them to design applications that emphasize a model's strengths while avoiding or informing end users of its weaknesses: for journalists and industry analysts, might provide insights that make it easier to explain complex technology to a general audience and might even help advocacy groups better understand the impact of al on their communities. google has designed examples for two features of its cloud vision api, face detection and object detection. provide overviews of both models' ideal forms of input, visualize some of their limitations, and present basic performance metrics. both are early proofs of concept, to advance the conversation around the value of transparency in al. datasheets for datasets the machine learning community currently has no standardized process for documenting datasets, which can lead to severe consequences in high-stakes domains: to address this gap, microsoft proposed datasheets for datasets in the electronics industry, every component, no matter how simple or complex, is accompanied with a datasheet that describes its operating characteristics, test results, recommended uses, and other information. by  analogy, it is .  /arxivorg/pdf/.-pdf .  withgoogle com/about  they they they key



proposed that every dataset be accompanied with a datasheet that documents its motivation, composition, collection process, recommended uses, and so on. datasheets for datasets will facilitate better communication between dataset creators and dataset consumers, and encourage the machine learning community to prioritize transparency and accountability:  fact sheet the of ibms fact sheet project is to foster trust in al by increasing transparency and enabling governance: increased transparency provides information for al consumers to better understand how the al model was created. this allows a consumer of the model to determine if it is appropriate for their situation. ai governance enables an enterprise to specify and enforce describing how an al model or service should be constructed and deployed. this can prevent undesirable situations, such as a model training with unapproved datasets, models having biases, or models having unexpected performance variations: a fact sheet is a collection of relevant information (facts) about the creation and deployment of an al model or service. facts could range from information about the purpose and criticality of the model, measured characteristics of the dataset; model, or service , or actions taken during the creation and deployment process of the model or service. .  .   goal policies

national artificial intelligence strategy for qatar executive summary artificial intelligence (al) based technologies have been steadily permeating into our lives. however; this is just the beginning: al has the potential of upending how we conduct our lives, how the economy is transacted, and how our communities are organized. in this document we provide an overview of al in the context of qatar as a country, identify the pillars to build a great al research and innovation ecosystem in qatar and follow those with recommendations for action: our vision is to have al so pervasive in all aspects of life, business and governance in qatar that everyone looks up to qatar as a role model for seamlessly transitioning into an al+x future. qatar: al+x future race for talent al augmented jobs knowledge economy strong academic and encourage local businesses attractive jurisdiction experiential learning to embrace new al solutions. to incorporate al-driven curriculum for the al+x businesses: future. invest in people and their lead and participate in ideas for qatar's future international efforts to doha as a global hub through training, immersive standardize the use of al: for attracting al talent: experiences and startup funds data and computing infrastructure launch and lead multilateral level diplomatic efforts for data-sharing among countries with small populations. world-class cloud and computing infrastructure with strict data-residency requirements. ethics and governance of ai strong ""al ethics and governance"" framework rooted in local context and aligned to international norms. guidelines for the level of explainability required for different types of decisions made by al algorithms: key



introduction qatar needs an overarching al strategy that supports the national vision and is rooted in its local context: the goal of this strategy is to leverage al to secure qatar's economic and strategic future, as envisioned in qnv2030,and prepare the society for effective adoption of al technology that is aligned with local needs and traditions. the al strategy is structured around six thematic pillars which together will guide qatar to transform itself for an al+x future. the moniker ""al+x"" refers to the emerging consensus that al technology will permeate into all secular aspects of human endeavors: health, entertainment; business activity, education and research. modern al is predicated on the use of data as a strategic resource. raw data needs to be coupled with technological capability to produce new al-driven products which will transform the normative basis of how societies operate and function. having invested heavily in an education and research infrastructure, qatar is poised to play a leadership role in an al+x future. the global ai race artificial intelligence (al) is a transformative technology of the 21st century and one of the main arenas in which nations of the world will compete: the ceo of google has stated that al may be ""more important than fire or electricity:"" this is an exaggeration, but it has become very clear that al will transform all facets of human society education, healthcare, transportation, business, entertainment; warfare, and more. the origins of al lie in the usa and the most recent developments in the field have come from north america: however; other countries are vying for ""al superpower"" status. china aims to be the global leader in al by  and is investing heavily to achieve this goal, especially in the use of ""data"" as a strategic asset. countries such as canada, japan; and the uk have also adopted al strategies that aim at global leadership. other countries such as denmark; taiwan, and south korea have developed al strategies that do not necessarily aim at global leadership, but rather at promoting the use of al throughout society and developing al solutions for local needs'. increasing local al adoption is the beginning of a journey to become competitive as a society in the global economy: the leadership in many advanced countries have concluded that capacity building in al technology is vital for a sustainable and viable economy: as al's leverage increases in a connected world economy, we will increasingly see a winner takes all"" trend dominating in businesses. this will have a serious implication on how nations, organizations, or even individuals think about building al capacity and applications that are viable. in a world where innovative ideas and software can originate anywhere and thrive, excellence is not just a lofty goal to achieve but a necessary requirement: there is no escape from excellence in the impending al future:



national artificial intelligence strategy for qatar why qatar should participate in the ai race qatar is a forward looking nation and has a clearly stated vision of using its economic advantage derived from fossil fuels to transform itself into a knowledge-based economy: indeed, the investments that qatar has already made in research and development efforts in al can serve as a foundation to build strong capabilities in the area and provide a head start to make globally recognized al-based solutions. for qatar; following are the threats and opportunities in an al future: threats in qatar; economic diversification has been identified as an inescapable step towards becoming knowledge-driven society: this implies that qatar must become globally competitive in selective niche areas. as al permeates into all sectors f human activity, not competing in the al arena will significantly hurt qatar's plans of diversification. al-enabled automation will have a profound impact on the employment landscape in all countries as qatari citizens are overwhelmingly employed in administrative white collar occupations, the threat of job tasks becoming susceptible to automation is very real in qatar: opportunities qatar has a small; educated and information technology savvy population. using al derived automation to augment human capability that enhances both capacity and capability of the qatari workforce is entirely possible in a reasonably short time horizon. by making judicious investment in al technology, qatar can accrue downstream benefits by owning the future ""means of production"".



al spring big data, algorithms, and cloud the term artificial intelligence is not new: it was coined in the summer of  by a group of renowned american scientists?. however; the field of al in its early days had a history of over-promising and under delivering: the public in the 's and 's were fascinated by promises of ""thinking machines"" that can understand language; play chess, and diagnose diseases, only to be disappointed when none of these predictions materialized in a meaningful way: this led to periods of disenchantment with al and withdrawal of funding for al projects, the so called ""al winters."" since the 1990s al has been able to deliver on its promises and there has been a much better understanding of its capabilities and its limitations. a narrow form of al grounded in data has taken root and won over skeptics. al was finally able to beat a world chess champion, drive a car autonomously, and defeat the two greatest champions in the jeopardyl game show:. al became an integral part of many technologies such as web search engines, natural language processing, logistics optimization, robotics, and medical diagnosis. the period since  onwards can be truly called an ""al spring:"" al is no longer a technology component, but rather the main enabler for many business and scientific solutions, from image recognition to self- driving cars to targeted political advertisements. the confluence of big data, algorithms and access to cheap computing power through cloud computing has created: the virtuous cycle enabling al revolution computing power big data computers become over the last two years increasingly powerful alone % of the data in and inexpensive the world was generated every year al algorithms new algorithms learn from many data examples but require extensive computing power



pillars of qatar's ai strategy the national al strategy of qatar has six pillars: education; data access, employment; business, research, and ethics it envisions two roles for qatar: first; qatar must become capable of producing world class al applications in areas of national interest and have a business environment enabling the use al as a driver for innovation. second, qatar must be an efficient consumer of al, with a properly educated citizenry, sound laws, and ethical guidelines. the national al strategy would be a powerful technological enabler for the qatar national vision . qnv  is itself organized around four pillars: economic, social, human, and environmental, and al is indispensable for all the four pillars. for example, the economic pillar calls for the development of a 'knowledge-based economy:"" by investing in al education and homegrown al solutions, the effort to ground the economy on knowledge capital can be accelerated: similarly, developing an endogenous al-based capacity for promoting transportation efficiency can help reduce pollution and foster environmental development: there are six pillars that we have identified for qatar's al strategy: these cover all aspects of al relevant to qatar and provide a framework for organizing action plans and investments in the future:



pillar : race for talent in the ""al+x"" era developing and even using al technology requires special skills that are in short supply all over the world. al is likely to be embedded in all aspects of human activity, a phenomenon that can be called ""al+x"". there is massive demand for al talent; driving up salaries and creating intense competition among companies to hire in al related roles such as data scientists and software engineers. data science and al courses at major universities and through online providers attract literally thousands of students: thus, the first pillar of qatar's national al strategy should be education and training: qatar is uniquely positioned to reap the benefits of al. more than % of the qatari population uses the internet; one of the highest rates in the world. widespread internet usage indicates that qatari citizenry is constantly being exposed to al-enabled technology including computer vision, language and speech processing and digital maps. when it comes to al, the future has already arrived. designing and producing al-products that are optimized for local needs and usage is not as far-fetched as it might seem and can be enabled by necessary education and training: al+x paradigm: al education should be an integral part of the curriculum at all educational levels in all disciplines. at the k- level, younger students should learn to deal with the recommendations of al. for example, al typically provides its recommendations in the form of probabilities, so students should learn the basics of decision-making in the face of uncertainty: the move away from sense-based towards intellectual perception is rooted in medieval islamic philosophys. students should also learn about interacting with al as part of their environment: for example, learning to reject the recommendations of al that clearly disagree with common sense. older students should have the opportunity to learn technical and philosophical aspects of al. it is also important to ""teach the teachers""about al by developing professional learning courses or online training: at the university level, computing-related departments should prepare their graduates for careers in stem and al disciplines. other academic departments should be attuned to the use of al in their disciplines and educate their graduates to be prepared when encounter it: al education also encompasses al coursesor boot camps that prepare those already in the workforce to work in al-related jobs, especially if their current jobs can be replaced by al. in addition, management and executive training that educates business leaders on the necessary basics of al should be availables. finally, in addition to growing iocal al talent; qatar should attract top al international talent in education, research, and entrepreneurship by introducing fast-track residency permits and creating a tech-friendly investment environment: recommendations: develop a strong academic and experiential learning curriculum for the al+x future (i.e-, projects/ activity driven) for k- to build local capacity for managing interactions with al, imagining/planning al solutions from a young age, and building strong foundations in computational methods and stem curriculum to develop al applications in the future. quantify the amount of necessary talent required in stem disciplines to inculcate an al ecosystem: design degree programs with in-built apprenticeship pathways (e.g-, al based medicine) where students can interact with researchers and businesses for building qatar-relevant al applications: promote a vibrant research and entrepreneurship ecosystem for innovative al applications that naturally align with qatar's national interest: adopt strategies for attracting top al talent from all over the world such as: internationally competitive incentives, fast-track residency, easy yet well-regulated data access to facilitate innovation, and policies to encourage integration of locally developed al solutions. they



national artificial intelligence strategy for qatar pillar : data access is paramount the current al revolution is based on big data, and modern al models require large amounts of data to train them: data is the key asset that underpins the resurgence in al and its usage and release needs to be strategically shepherded: one way for qatar to quickly gain an al advantage is to develop data governance rules and guidelines that facilitate broad access to and sharing of data consistent with the recently released qatar data privacy laws? . data sharing among organizations or even within an organization is impeded by two considerations. first; data has strategic and monetary value to the organization there is a saying that ""data is the new oil8 second, data sharing can violate the privacy of users. people with data are (justifiably) worried about these two considerations when they share data, so the tendency is not to share data release and sharing needs to be driven by a strategic imperative of enabling and promoting local al ecosystem: for example, china has been at the forefront of using data as a strategic tool to promote indigenous technology: data is the ""new source code"" and this perspective needs to be adopted by decision-makers in qatar: qatar has the unique advantage of being a small country that is well connected administratively: this makes development of broad data sharing guidelines possible, and it can be one of the competitive advantages of qatar in the area of ai. recommendations: qatar should create a data strategy office responsible for educating government and business organizations and developing guidelines for the use of data as a strategic resource. qatar should develop guidelines for data sharing that encourage people with data to share it and make clear the best practices for doing so. the guidelines should spell out the obligations of the receiver of the data. for government entities, these guidelines can be elevated to be mandatory policies. qatar should launch and lead multilateral level diplomatic efforts for data-sharing among countries with small populations. for most countries including qatar; developing successful al applications that can generate export revenue won't be possible without greater data sharing at a global level. there is no such multilateral initiative in the world, hence this is an opportunity for qatar to take a leadership role: being a small country with a very diverse population, qatar should leverage locally collected data by integrating and curating in ways that allow it to be repurposed and hence democratizes development of novel futuristic applications.



pillar : the changing landscape of employment there is an intense ongoing debate among experts about the impact that al technology will have on the future of employment and jobs in the coming years. the extreme view is that al technology will result in massive employment disruption as many tasks that currently require human involvement have the potential of being replaced by al. in a highly cited work carried out by researchers at oxford university, over % of jobs in the us are under risk of becoming automated? economic theory suggests that the long-term financial returns on capital tend to be higher than labor and thus those who own capital will benefit disproportionately from al technology: this has the potential of causing social upheaval and disequilibrium. the impact of al technology on qatar is likely to be very different from what other countries may experience: in fact; qatar can leverage the al revolution to realize its vision of transforming into knowledge based economy by carefully investing in strategically important al technologies  qatar is home to around . million people out of which approximately % are local qataris and the rest are non-qataris who reside in the country specifically on the basis of employment: most qataris working outside the military and security forces have white-collar occupations, primarily in the public sector: many of these white-collar jobs are, in principle, susceptible to outright al replacement or al augmentation""o . for example, according to the  qatar labor survey, % of the qatari male and % of the qatari female workforce is employed in clerical positions"" . single-skill white-collar positions such as these are most susceptible to automation: however; nearly % of economically active qataris have a university education one of the highest rates in the world. by embracing al and encouraging its citizens to be al-skilled, qatar can become one of the first countries in the world where citizens and al technology can work together in harmony: sidra medicine 



national artificial intelligence strategy for qatar consider the example of qatar's burgeoning medical tourism industry: qatar is ranked 30thin the world1z for medical tourism and is rapidly developing a world-class medical infrastructure with several hospitals having already obtained highly sought after international accreditation. al technology can help qatar accelerate the growth in medical tourism and provide knowledge jobs for qatari citizens and residents. for example, international standards for the ratio of nurses to patients range from : to : depending on the nature of the medical treatment: however; many of the procedural tasks that a nurse carries out, like checking patient health parameters and delivery of medication, can be automated by existing al technology: the replacement of these tasks will not only be cost-efficient; but will lead to higher quality of service as machines are likely to make fewer human errors"" . similarly qatar is home to people from over eighty countries and there are at least eight large subpopulations which speak distinct languages an al-based speech and language translation system for medical communication can be built bottom up in qatar and exported to the rest of the world. however; the more human-interaction aspects of the nurse and patient relationship cannot be automated and qatari residents can be trained to carry out this particular aspect of the nursing function: thus, the augmentation of a nurse's job with al technology can be used to admit more patients per nurse, provide higher quality of care, and create specialized knowledge-intensive jobs. history shows that once the cost of using a new technology falls below a certain threshold then that technology rapidly permeates through society13. it is hard to predict what new applications will emerge that will take advantage of the emerging al technology: what remains constant is that economics is often the driver of technology adoption: one of the factors affecting the cost of adopting al in qatar compared to other countries is the ability of qatar to import low cost labor from the developing world. thus, the cost of labor intensive and inefficient solutions is often less than the cost of an al solution leading to a situation where long-term efficiencies are sacrificed for short-term benefits. recommendations: provide financial incentives to local businesses to embrace new al solutions and resist the temptation of using low-cost labor as a substitute for embracing al technology: educate/ train qatari citizens in managing, building and investing in al solutions for continuously improving the standards of living and economic productivity in qatar: key



pillar : new business and economic opportunities qatar has a modern; diverse, technology-driven business landscape. besides a world leading oil and gas industry, qatar is home to a major international airline, an influential financial sector; and a robust power generation enterprise. al will transform the economic and business landscape in qatar; and the national al strategy should address this transformation: al is already being adopted by businesses worldwide; mckinsey estimates that global technology companies such as google and baidu spent a total of s20- billion on al in . these technology companies are the early adopters of al, but investment in al is also happening in other sectors such as financial services, manufacturing, and agriculture: early adopters are already seeing the benefits of al, which is accelerating adoption by other companies. the national al strategy of qatar should enable existing businesses to adopt al, and catalyze the creation of new businesses based on al technology: for example, the qatari government can provide guidelines and best practices for businesses that plan to adopt al, or even direct financial and technical assistance to these businesses to help them in adopting al technologies. startup funds and incubators should be directed to focus on al-based companies. since data is essential for modern al, enabling access to the data that businesses need for developing their al models can be a major driver of the adoption of al in businesses. the other component of modern alis a powerful computing infrastructure. this infrastructure can be partly provided by the private sector but the government needs to play a role in ensuring that the computing infrastructure available to businesses is powerful enough to meet the demands of al. for example; the internet connectivity within qatar and internationally should support the capacity requirements of al. the government can accelerate the adoption of al in the business sector by adopting al in its own public services that way businesses interfacing with al-enabled public services will feel the need to become al-enabled themselves: in addition, al-enabled public services can be a quick success for al that is felt by qatari citizens. the qatari government has a solid foundation on which to base al adoption in public services, since qatar already has a strong digital government; with services such as metrash, hukoomi; and baladiya/oun"". it is befitting to augment these services with al capabilities, resulting in more efficient service delivery that better responds to citizens' needs. recommendations: make investment commitments to develop programs for leveraging al in areas of strategic importance for qatar; e.g., oil and gas. build a regulatory and incentive framework that is stable, and makes qatar an attractive jurisdiction to incorporate by al driven businesses around the globe: develop and maintain cutting edge computing and connectivity infrastructure with a high degree of resilience. launch and participate in international efforts to bring standardization in all aspects of ai, e.g-, network and systems architecture; data and application integration protocols, requirements on test case coverage, services, etc. that ensure a level playing field. 



national artificial intelligence strategy for qatar pillar : qatar al + x focus areas in some cases,it is appropriate to procure existing al solutions and deploy them in qatar: however; there will be cases where it is imperative to develop local homegrown al solutions. the reason can be that the solution addresses specific local needs of qatar; that qatar is uniquely positioned to be a global leader in developing the solution, or that the solution is highly strategic and must be controlled locally: qatar must ensure it has global al research leadership in areas of national interest; and that local technology enterprises have sufficient technical capacity to develop al solutions. some example areas where it is imperative for qatar to develop local al solutions are as follows arabic language processing: as an arabic speaking country, the use of al arabic language processing should be a national priority for qatar: qatar has a wealth of content in arabic that can be used to develop al models, and arabic language processing capabilities can enable impactful applications in education, media, security, and other areas of strategic importance. to illustrate, qatar computing research institute (qcri) has developed multiple arabic language processing systems such as an automatic speech-to-text system for arabic that is in use by the al jazeera media network, a suite of arabic text processing tools known as farasa that is considered the best in the world, and a powerful arabic-to-english translation system: qatar can be a world leader in the use of al for arabic language processing and generation. national security: cyber security has become an al problem. advanced techniques for identifying and mitigating cyber threats depend to a high degree on data analytics and ai. additionally, using al to analyze publicly available data can provide advanced warning of threats. such highly strategic infrastructure should rely on homegrown and locally controlled solutions. signals from social-media now constitute a major focus of attention by intelligence agencies around the world to infer security threats to a nation. by building local systems, which correlate network, and social media traffic can go a long way in creating another layer of security for qatar precision medicine and systems biology: al will radically transform the way healthcare and medicine is practiced. the holy grail of personalized and precision medicine and the concept of ""from bench to bedside"" is realizable with ai. a consensus is emerging within the medical research community that a systems biology perspective which harnesses multiomic (genomic, proteomic, metabolomics) data is necessary to make next generation medical breakthroughs: the qatar genome project provides fine-grained data about citizens f qatar and should serve as the basis of uncovering persistent disease patterns in the local population: a high rate of consanguinity in the local population makes the qatar genome data highly unique and its usage and release needs to be strategically guided. more lifestyle and clinical data can be acquired from wearable devices, electronic health records and even social media. high quality data with world class medical and bioinformatics research infrastructure; including hamad medical corporation, sidra medicine; weill-cornell medicine-qatar; qbri, and qcri, can catapult qatar to the forefront of personalized medicine, emergency services, and al based medical education and research.  for along



transportation and fifa world cup : qatar is undergoing a rapid expansion in transportation infrastructure, whether it is road networks, the new hamad port and airport; and expansion of qatar airways and qatar rail. this is a unique opportunity to in place al-enabled infrastructure from the get go. additionally, al can help in managing the logistics challenges of world cup ,and enhance the experience of fans in the stadium and viewers at home. these al use cases would then help build the tourism industry post . through it tasmui6 program, the motc has already proposed several use cases to transform qatar into a digitally ""smart' nation. many of these use cases already have a strong data-driven focus using al qatar can become a role model for sustainable urban development by cutting emissions in energy production and manufacturing from its current globally highest per capita levels food security: food security has been identified as a national priority by qatar: there is a tremendous potential for applying al technology at the food-energy-water nexus and many countries, mostly notably the netherlands, have taken the lead in promoting next generation precision agriculture and vertical farming techniques. there is a to generate massive amounts of data at the finest granularity level in agriculture and create customized water and fertilizer usage plans which increases crop yield and is environment friendly at the same time. al will play a big role in achieving food security in qatar and everywhere in the future when severe strain on yields and arable land is expected due to climate change. furthermore qatar should develop customized al-driven simulations to prepare contingency plans to maintain food supply pipelines in face of regional disruptions and threats. oil and gas: qatar's mature oil and gas industry stands to benefit significantly from ai. qatar-based companies have access to the most fine-grained logging data from gas operations which can be leveraged to create niche al-products in the oil and gas sector: for example the use of this data to develop solutions for predictive maintenance enabled could help realize tremendous efficiency gains and reduce production downtimes. al will also enable data driven revenue management and logistics optimization: recommendations: build applications using arabic language processing for business use cases to become the leader in this domain among the arab nations: leverage al expertise available within the country in strategically important domains for qatar like oil and gas, transportation; health, and cybersecurity to build competitive advantage in specific use cases that could also generate export revenues in the future: use fifa  to collect data and pilot al application ideas that could also benefit qatar in the run_  put push long



national artificial intelligence strategy for qatar pillar : ethics and public policy the increasing pervasiveness of al in our personal lives and work poses many ethical and public policy questions al methods tend to acquire ""black box' characteristics and sometimes are not amenable to fairness, accountability and transparency principles that are vital for the long-term viability of societies and countries. al algorithms will inherit any biases' consecrated in data and mechanisms are required that guarantee outputs which are consistent with societal norms"". transparency and accountability require al models to be explainable, i.e,, the output of an al algorithm be describable in plain natural language: explainability and interpretability in al is emerging as an important al research topic in its own right: for example consider an al algorithm that decides how patients should be prioritized to receive scarce organ transplants. if a ""pure data"" solution is used then an algorithm may inadvertently use longevity as a criterion and rank the patients based primarily on age. modern al relies on data including personally identifiable information (pii). for many technological companies the user is a product and advertisers are the customers who pay a fee to access user information: there is an increasing worldwide to treat private information as a human right and qatar should use the recently introduced general data protection regulation (gdpr) by the european union as a template to introduce guidelines that protect its citizens from online exploitationi8. qatar's ministry of transportation and communication (motc) and previously ictqatar (which is now part of motc) had issued guidelines for qatar on privacy and data sharing that are in alignment with qatar's traditions and ambitions these would form an excellent starting to develop a larger and comprehensive set of guidelines for the country: recommendations: the qatari government should introduce guidelines for the level of explainability and interpretability required for different types of decisions made by al algorithms: build up from the existing guidelines on privacy, data sharing, etc. developed by the ministry of transportation and communications (motc) and previously ict qatar: qatar should develop an ""al ethics and governance"" framework for addressing ethical and public policy questions, which will become increasingly important as the use of al expands into sensitive areas of society such as policing, courts, health, and warfare: the framework to be developed must be consistent with both qatari social, cultural, and religious norms and international guidelines while ensuring that qatar emerges as a leading proponent of ai.  push point



conclusion the proposed strategy provides specific recommendations for the leadership of qatar to set course, embark and flourish in the brave new world of artificial intelligence. globally, the consensus has been building that the advent of artificial intelligence (ai) is the next technological inflection point at par with the industrial revolution, the benefits and consequences of which we are still witnessing: those who can develop mastery in using and developing al applications will reap its benefits and thrive. qatar is well positioned to take advantage of this golden opportunity and become a critical player in the al economy of the future. however; we need to act with a sense of urgency to realize this opportunity before it becomes too late as the al race among countries is becoming very competitive. qatar needs to act on the recommendations listed under the six pillars of the proposed national ai strategy to ensure it builds sustainable competitive advantages and remains a critical player in the global economy and society: this would require significant investments in the education and retraining of its citizenry to augment their existing capabilities with al technologies and build an ecosystem conducive to developing path breaking al technologies in qatar: hbku research complex
