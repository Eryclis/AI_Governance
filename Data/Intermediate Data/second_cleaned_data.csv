digital switzerland strategy  purpose the digital switzerland strategy sets the guidelines for switzerland's digital transformation'. it is binding for the federal administration? and serves as an orientation for all other actors involved in digitalisation: the aim is for the population as a whole to benefit from a sustainable and respon- sible digital transformation. this is being driven forward jointly by the authorities at all federal levels, as well as by actors from civil society, business, academia and politics. under focus themes, the federal council identifies two to three priorities each year as a way of launching digital transformation themes this focus is complemented by the action plan, which pro- vides an overview of activities in the area of digital transformation for the general public. in contrast to the annually changing focus themes, the vision and domains remain stable over several years. the digital switzerland strategy provides a framework in the sense of an umbrella strategy for the federal digitalisation strategy; the swiss egovernment strategy and various other sectoral strategies it also helps switzerland to achieve its climate and environmental goals and the sus- tainable development goals set out in the united nations  agenda. vision switzerland consistently prioritises digital offerings for the benefit of the people (digital first):. it makes targeted use of the opportunities offered by digital transformation so that everyone ben- efits in the run. switzerland is one of the most digitally competitive and innovative countries in europe: domains with indicators the digital switzerland strategy  is structured around five longterm domains. these domains are based on the eu's digital compass'. focus themes and measures are each assigned to a do- main. this structure is intended to create a clear overview of sovereign activities that are impor- tant for a digital switzerland: the federal council measures progress in each domain according to two indicators* as far as possible, the values are compared against international benchmarks: education and skills people, businesses and public authorities have sufficient skills to make the most ofnew technologies and are able to question them: indicators: share of the population with advanced digital skills 41per cent * share of ict specialists on the swiss labour market (excl  apprentices) . per cent "" security and trust people in switzerland can move around safely in the digital environment; privacy is protected: indicators: threat situation in cyberspace no: of cyber incidents reported to the   national cyber security centre cybercrime, identification of crimes with a cyber element  cases * framework businesses and society can rely on a reliable and advantageous framework for the digital environment: indicators: digital competitiveness, switzerland s place in the imd world digital competitiveness rankings "" share of new firms in the ict sector as a percentage of the total number of start-ups . per cent "" see_ordinance_of 25_november _2020on the_coordination of the di_ offered. a distinction is therefore made between 'digital first' and the gital transformation and ict steering in the federal administration: ""digital only' principle, which relies exclusively on digital solutions_ sr1z2010. see_europes_digital_decade:_digital_targets_for_2030 european the scope ofapplication complies with art2 of the government and commission (europa eu) administration organisation act of  march  sr1z201q the  indicators were initially defined. they are reviewed on an ongo - under 'digital first; digital solutions are prioritised whenever possib- ing basis and adjusted if necessary: for details see www digital swiss / le and wherever practical. if necessary non-digital solutions are also long

foreword through its continued efforts toward the early realization of the digital pakistan vision of the government of pakistan, the ministry of it and telecom is committed to providing its people with timely and equal access to opportunities by stimulating culture of innovation through an overarching developmental agenda orchestrated to embrace cutting-edge   technologies such as artificial   intelligence   efficiently and responsibly: in this regard, the artificial intelligence (al) policy is a pivotal milestone for transforming pakistan into a knowledge-based economy as it spells out national strategy to establish an ecosystem necessary for al adoption by harnessing an agile framework for addressing different aspects of unique user journeys encompassing different market horizontals and industry verticals by ensuring responsible use of ai. furthermore, the policy aims to go beyond the meagre approach of adopting technology to fundamentally rethink al adoption in the local context so that new growth areas can be identified and intervened in considering the existing job market's relevance while empathizing with the growing population of the country: this policy stems from the ""al for good"" initiative by the international telecommunication union and the sustainable development goals set forth by the united nations. considering the disruptive nature of al and allied technologies and how it is re-ordering the socio- economic construct of the world, we desire to live in. therefore, it is essential to responsibly harness this opportunity while keeping the interest of a common person foremost: therefore, to survive and thrive, pakistan aims to revitalize its resolve toward digitalization, which will involve processing personal data through al. to this end,the said policy coherently interlaces with the personal data protection act, pakistan cloud first policy, and the digital pakistan policy initiatives. 



executive summary pakistan has a unique opportunity to harness digital disruption by educating an eager young population that can potentially   propel the nation onto growth trajectory to sustain our future national competitiveness and improve the lives of citizens. artificial intelligence (al) represents the next frontier of technological opportunities, and it has been widely proven and understood that the collection, processing, use, and exchange of data through automated/intelligent means would drive the entire society into the next stage of its evolution which is unprecedented and requires a progressive, yet careful approach: so, after a thorough analysis of the global perspective and based on the evidence collected through more extensive consultations with the stakeholders, the ministry of it and telecom has come to much-desired conclusion that it needs to chalk out a developmental roadmap for better, faster and responsible adoption of alin the country: for that, the policy document is put in place to reap long-term and sustainable benefits for its people. the policy document offers wide range of developmental initiatives necessary for awareness and adoption, reimagining the transparent and fair use of personal data using al and stimulating innovation through industry-academia collaborations and investments in al-led initiatives. the national al policy is crafted to focus on the equitable distribution of opportunity and its responsible use, having the following defining attributes. evidence-based and target oriented user-centric and forward-looking objective and overarching the al policy further aims to augment al and allied technologies through balanced demand and supply- side interventions, as briefly described below: market enablement establishment of research and innovation centers in al for developing, test- bedding, deploying, and scaling al solutions. this includes learning how to improve governance and manage the impact of al: progressive and trusted environment responsible use of al to generate economic gains and improve lives. in addition, al will raise the government's capability to deliver anticipatory and personalized services enabling ai through awareness and readiness pakistan shall increase awareness and understanding of al technologies and their benefits; our workforce will be equipped with the necessary competencies to participate in the al economy_ transformation and evolution transformation of sectors and industries towards effective use of al, facilitated by national it boards through creating awareness and offering training programs through sectoral cooperation.



 introduction and context . why pakistan needs ai policy the need for national al policy is to create a broad-based awareness ofthe use f al-based platforms while keeping privacy at the forefront; upskilling human capital on al and allied technologies, guiding investment in al research and development, ensuring ethical and responsible use of al, and provide a framework for addressing the challenges and risks associated with the socio-economic outfit of the country: the al policy covers the following areas, including: investment in research and development infrastructure: pakistan should invest in research and development to build in-house al capabilities required for application development based on local data. this investment should include funding for establishing research organizations that have a sustainable mandate of basic research, data standardization, providing support to the government for   regulatory and  legal interventions   regarding al; maintaining central   computational infrastructure, data storage facilities, and partnerships with universities and research institutions both domestically and internationally: this investment should also include training programs to build the necessary technical expertise: the al policy outlines how pakistan must collaborate with other countries to share best practices and expertise in al: ethical and responsible use: the al policy proposed the establishment of an al regulatory directorate that ensures the ethical and responsible use of al. this includes ensuring that al is not used to discriminate against individuals or groups and that its use is transparent and accountable. job displacement: the al policy addresses the potential job displacement that could result from the global proliferation of al: this includes investing in training programs to help existing and new workforce acquire the skills to adapt to changing job requirements. al can help to promote economic growth by encouraging investment in al research and development: this investment can lead to the creation of new jobs and industries, as well as improved productivity and efficiency: al policy can help address social and economic challenges by improving healthcare outcomes, providing better access to education, and addressing food security challenges. al policy can help ensure that al's benefits are shared equitably across society. this includes addressing issues such as bias and discrimination and ensuring that the benefits of al are not concentrated in the hands of a few. . the state of al in pakistan pakistan has a population of  million as of  and is predicted to reach  million by  [], with current literacy rate of around .% []. moreover, pakistan is considered the fifth largest country in the world in terms of the young population; % of the nation is younger than  []. with such a propelling number of employable human capital, we have enormous development potential on one end and tremendous responsibility on the other. nevertheless, despite all the odds, pakistan has been able to register notable efforts through public/private interventions as follows: presidential initiative for artificial intelligence and computing (piaic) center for artificial intelligence and computing (centaic) national center of artificial intelligence (ncai) sino-pak center for artificial intelligence (spcai) these timely initiatives have performed well in their domains and need continuity to achieve long-term targets. to achieve the al-accelerated socio-economic development urgently required by pakistan and its actual impact on the gdp ofthe country, a national strategy for aladoption is critical: the al policy provides holistic structure, by the societal challenges regarding al adoption can be addressed by establishing the necessary ecosystem with specialized initiatives and organizational responsibilities. the policy proposes the national al fund as a perpetual and central fund to support the proposed interventions. key



 vision, scope and objectives . vision owing to the impact of al globally and its local adoption and implications, the government of pakistan envisions: ""to embrace al by appreciating human intelligence and stimulating a hybrid intelligence ecosystem for equitable, responsible, and transparent use of ai. . scope the policy framework is envisaged to provide a complete al-enabling ecosystem in pakistan, covering all aspects of awareness, skill development, standardization, and ethical use_ . objectives here the strategic objectives are distributed into two societal agendas of development and responsibility to efficiently evolve the society in the age of the fourth industrial revolution: developmental agenda responsibility agenda (embracing (appreciating human intelligence) training and upskilling human capital in al at all levels to address the needs and demands of the ensure the ethical use of al through inclusive and market efficiently: forward-looking guidelines: integrating al into the national curriculums at all levels is essential from a necessity, application, and use standpoint: provide an enabling platform for al with appropriate increasing public awareness to facilitate the sandbox and agile regulatory arrangements to adoption of al sustainably: address societal and regulatory challenges (only where necessary): to embrace research and innovation-based culture, offer fiscal/non-fiscal incentives to start-ups/smes define data standards and invest in computational investing in al-based services/technologies: resources for  the  responsible use of  organized datasets. strengthen international   collaboration with both academia and industry: . policy drivers and targets the policy drivers help navigate the identified gaps and challenges by orchestrating journey-based approach comprising four defining pillars of development and responsibility, complimented by progressive targets for effective policy implementation. .. the drivers through the challenges and gaps, the policy lays a fundamental framework driven through a pillar-based approach driven through the developmental journey of al adoption and proliferation using agile and all- inclusive models incrementally: these drivers are:  ai)



... 1st pillar: enabling al through awareness and readiness the first pillar will focus on societal preparation in becoming increasingly aware of the potential benefits of al, deployment requirements, and adopting measures for establishing readiness towards al adoption: targeted interventions achieve this in meeting the societal gaps_ the interventions include awareness proliferation programs related to al, improving the quality of randd in al through applied research, and further enhancing the footprint in al through fiscal/logistical support, curriculum development, and review of existing coursework to make it more relevant to global demand and best practices. furthermore, the upskilling of the current workforce shall be done through bootcamps and high-impact short courses using massive open online courses (moocs) platforms: the initiative aims to meet the societal gaps of awareness and adaptation challenges (g1). ... pillar: al market enablement the second pillar will help organize matters related to establishing an ecosystem to facilitate the development and deployment of al. this includes steps taken to address the identified societal challenges, including awareness and adaptation challenges (g1), data standardization and accessibility (g2), and computational needs (g3). ... 3rd pillar: building progressive and trusted environment the third pillar focuses on the interventions necessary for building a progressive and trusted environment where the personal data of citizens and the data of organizations are protected: this section addresses awareness and adaptation challenges (g1) and ethical challenges (g4) to ensure the safe and responsible use of al and associated technologies ... 4th pillar: transformation and evolution this pillar focuses on developing roadmaps for each sector of society, including governance, so the necessary evolution toward al adoption can be achieved: during the process, several interventions are highlighted to facilitate this transformation, including industrial transformation and sandboxing: in addition, this driver will assist us in addressing awareness and adaptation challenges (g1) and data standardization and accessibility (g2). .. the national al targets navigating through the policy drivers, the national al targets reflect the needs and concerns which will be addressed through subsequent policy interventions with definite yet simple approach presenting bandwagon of tangible opportunities having the following attributes: the proposed targets are highly focused and inclusive: b the said targets are simple, realistic, and achievable: the targets offer a reasonable amount of time for its initiation and achieving desired results with impact registration: d. the offered targets can be reviewed quantifiably: e_ as explained later in the document, special consideration is given to agility for implementing different programs, so holistic approach toward al adoption could be exercised: f the targets are based on the international developmental agenda for al and best practices, which will allow recognition of pakistan on the global front: 2nd

. market challenges the evidence furnished above simplifies the identification of challenges leading to pragmatic market support and only necessary interventions. these challenges are: ... g1 awareness and adaptation challenges it is becoming increasingly important that society is aware of the potential of al in solving routine matters this requires an awareness campaign towards controlling and sharing data, basic skills education, and high-impact skilling at all levels of the community for sustainable growth: nations dominating the al and allied technologies arena have instituted well-defined human capital development and evolution mechanisms to prepare the future generation for al adoption in various sectors through  sizable public/private investments and to retain the talent locally: moreover, international universities have inculcated al-based curricula in their primary, high- school, undergraduate, and post-graduate programs to ensure that al is adopted in a structured manner offering comprehensive development plan for its role in different phases of life and work in pakistan, enabling al and allied technologies is challenging without having basic level of awareness about the technology at the user level. it should be complemented with skilled human resources, having a broader understanding of how and where al should be applied and the best practices in this technology for its effective and responsible use. the major hurdle in preparing al- trained human capital is the access to data needed to train them in various domains of al-based technologies. hence, data is the underlying artefact for putting skilled human capital to work and making them experiment with using al-based models in a controlled yet agile environment: im. al adoption would disrupt how work will be done in public and private sectors and various industries, directly affecting the country's socio-economic fabric; people working in traditional ways and not skilled in al-based technologies are at risk of losing their jobs if not pivoted timely: this issue must be addressed on priority basis, which can only be done through awareness and upskilling: customized learning programs, workshops, and courses can assist such individuals in surviving this transition and becoming an integral part of digitally transformed workplaces. iv. according to the surveys, at a sectoral scale, half of the respondents are well versed with al and related technologies, while the other half possess working knowledge. to teach an al-based curriculum, the survey findings point to including short courses and - month-long boot camps/diplomas urgently. furthermore, bachelor's/master's level programs and ph.d. degrees in al are also worth considering: the significant adaptation challenges towards al proliferation include digitization of information, digital access, literacy, and digital inclusion by design: heaps of data are available in the public and private sectors, either difficult to access or not available appropriately (such as in hard copies): in many cases, it has been observed that data digitalization and basic process automation in confined environment are considered sufficient due to a lack of awareness_ alternatively, cloud- based solutions using al for data/process orchestration, management, and analytics offered as saas provides greater access. however, with limited knowledge, such services are never done justice in terms of their utilization. moreover, in several cases, local smes and enterprises are not using al and allied technologies effectively, leading to demand-side paralysis. for instance, digitizing healthcare-related data is essential in getting patients' history accessible to the doctors as well as various diagnostic and randd. unfortunately, the healthcare sector is digitized at fundamental level with limited or zero technological transformation and the standardization of data, which is a significant hurdle in enabling al-based advancement in the healthcare sector. vi. digital literacy is another challenge as people are to be educated about data digitization and accessibility and how to adopt safe data-sharing mechanisms. moreover, it needs to be organized 



to allow equal opportunity for children, women from remote areas, and disabled persons to benefit from the al proliferation efforts and meet future challenges ... g2 data standardization and accessibility globally, leaders in al proliferation have made data standardization and accessibility their top priority. for example, china used the vast datasets available from the provinces to train al and allied technologies, especially in the healthcare sector. as a result; it took the burden from the hospitals and medical practitioners. estonia is another shining example of data standardization and accessibility that enabled the small european country to lead in al adoption. organizations obtain data from several resources ifthis data from disparate sources is not brought to common operating environment, it will create significant problems in its processing for different purposes and uses therefore, pakistan'$ primary issue is to digitize and organize the massive datasets available in various inaccessible forms and make them available in a standardized form to make them more relevant for data analytics and other data processing mechanisms. this is only achievable through sustainable developmental hubs and associated collaborations in different sectors. i. data standardization has been done in the financial sector according to international standards to retain a competitive edge: most companies in the it industry have also ensured standardization and accessibility: however, as learned through the survey, other sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, retail and commerce, and healthcare lag significantly in this domain. significant efforts are required to develop andaugment an ecosystem that catalyzes the countrys adoption of aland allied technologies moreover, the lack of accessibility to data hinders al-based randd, predictive analytics, and various other al-based technologies from producing valuable outputs. it adversely affects advancement in research and development and al proliferation: the survey results report: a. the lack of accessibility of data has been pointed out by % of the stakeholders, which is a prerequisite to al adoption in any sector. b % of the stakeholders shared their concerns about data not being standardized: c. % of respondents consider poor data collection practices a crippling factor for successful al adoption. d  of the stakeholders recommend following leaders in al adoption, such as the uk, estonia, and china, for data standardization mechanisms: ... g3 computational infrastructure situation and needs developed countries and the countries which have made significant progress in al proliferation have ensured the availability of computational equipment and facilities to the stakeholders and institutions to train the human capital and streamline the modernization of processes to ensemble sustainable al outfit: however, such efforts need resources these countries have ensured and made available to the relevant stakeholders_ il. limited computational resources are a shared obstacle by various sectors of pakistan: the need for computational facilities is emphasized for providing robust and secure access to infrastructure for complex randd and high-performing systems. furthermore, these computational facilities are essential for any initiative to train human resources in al and allied technologies. their availability under one roof is necessary to streamline the training and learning process. il. similarly, in many cases, the computational resources are not used optimally. therefore, national/provincial data repository of all the public sector data can be made available to a broader audience via secure/controlled channel: there is also strong need for training on high- performance computing technologies so that indigenous customized solutions can meet local computational requirements within the country: 



iv. % of stakeholders have registered concerns regarding the limited availability of computational resources as a barrier to achieving a trained workforce in al and allied technologies. to augment applied research and provide robust and secure access to infrastructure for complex randd, computational facilities are considered vital by % of stakeholders. ... g4 ethical challenges safe and secure data sharing and ethical adoption of al and allied technologies are primary concerns for every stakeholder, national or international: at global level, various countries that have adopted al formulated guidelines and principles for the ethical use of al and related technologies and established regulatory framework to streamline safe and secure data-sharing mechanisms. regulatory challenges must be addressed to establish an environment of trust_ moreover, it is the users' fundamental right that their data be safe and that their privacy is always upheld. therefore, an effective regulatory system that may steer al adoption, related initiatives, and data-sharing mechanisms is needed: most stakeholders voted various risks associated with al adoption medium to high, including malicious intent; data pollution, data model theft, fairness, precision deterioration, invasion of privacy, etc_

. two main trends have contributed to this shift: first, the extensive use of digital applications by the general public, such as natural language processing; has generated a significant amount of data essential to al development: the other factor has been the fast developments in computing capabilities; enabling the processing of increasingly large amounts of data: this development happened in parallel with significant advances in machine learning; a branch of al. data and al are already disrupting several sectors and will become a factor in economic development: while @ tremendous amount of opportunities are provided by al solutions (disaster management, road safety; or energy consumption management); some challenges are emerging (data protection; automation; cybersecurity): in order for societies to benefit from the opportunities provided by data and al and to address the challenges and threats they generate, governments have been framing their approach to support and regulate data and al. there are currently around  governments that have developed or are developing a national al strategy in the past two to three years: one of the central issues where government action is expected will be around data sharing and open data strategies: countries have adopted different approaches to collect, generate, and process data: countries also took strides in making public data available, ranging from limited data releases to open data by default: having large amounts of data available to public, private, academic, and research actors would provide economic benefits; increased citizens engagement; attractive environment for investors and accelerating innovation: for example, having access to data from municipalities can support local government in designing policies and public services taking into account the specific needs of populations: key key



. ksa's landscape including opportunities x challenges as a g20 country, it is necessary for ksa to bring its contribution and to benefit from the immense opportunities data and al would generate for the countrys development: becoming a key international actor in the field of data and al would require significant investments; upskilling and regulatory measures to create and enable the development of a domestic ecosystem ksas landscape including opportunities and challenges



. we are writing a new chapter for our generation and many others to come we acknowledge that data is the oil of the 21st century, and we have therefore set for our nation a clear vision to elevate the country to a leading position among the world's pioneering data and al-driven economies in fact; the large-scale transformation saudi arabia is going through under vision  requires the fast integration of the most advanced technological capabilities to accelerate the transition to achieve this vision efficiently, we need to make the right data-driven decisions, and this requires a lot of meaningful data, and the full power to unlock and to generate as many deep insights from the data as possible, and here comes the role of artificial intelligence. saudi arabia has long been recognized as powerhouse of the middle east: saudi displays several unique strategic advantages the potential lies in unique sectors at scale and investment powerhouse unique sectors at scale and an investment powerhouse with tech appetite through the public investment fund (pif) and the vision fund large scale transformation programs ksa's top leadership is committed to making change happen and to embrace the latest technologies young and vibrant population % of the population are under  years and are deeply entwined with the digital economy thriving environment for test-beds in newismart cities proliferation of new and smart cities such as neom that will provide opportunities to explore untested areas in data al ndtional strategy for dath and al | /

. as a result, this strategy would concentrate on the first phase this first phase is about maximizing the use cases of data and al to achieve the objectives set under vision  and accompany the transition and focus on key domains and niche topics to serve on the international scene. this includes supporting data and skills within both government and the private sector to prepare for @ growing labor market demand enhancing the regulatory environment to enable the development of a performing domestic ecosystem creating sector-specific data and al plans driving adoption of data management standards and policies across governement entities to collect data in readable and usable formats creating dynamic domestic and healthy data and al start-up ecosystem: this would require government support such as the establishment of a favorable regulatory environment; credit facilities and trainings building highly qualified national talents to respond to the needs of the market attracting sustained private and international investment into the saudi market elevating data and al rsi capabilities, quality and commercialization outcomes and establishing test-beds in new and smart cities building on the first phase would allow for setting the foundations for a new strategy after  to establish a data and al industry to compete on the global scene:



. our vision is translated into six strategic objectives: objective  position ksa as the global hub where the best of data € al is made reality ksa's vision as an international/regional hub for data and al activities requires solid presence on the global landscape of data and al through publicly available contributions therefore, we are developing a comprehensive plan for ksas contributions in global/local data and al global initiatives and events in fact; we are planning to host the first global al summit in ksa the summit will be a unique annual platform for global thought leaders, decision-makers and innovators to showcase, debate and shape the future agenda of al for governments, private sector and noos, to amplify al's positive value for humanity: objective  transform ksa's workforce with a steady local supply of data and al empowered talents data and al are transforming labor markets globally: most sectors will have to adapt in order to maximize the benefits this transformation is bringing: the faster we are in integrating data and al into our education system, professional trainings and into general public knowledge, the greater advantage we will gain in terms of employment; productivity and innovation: as for most countries undergoing the data and al transition, the kingdom, with its ambitious plan to develop its data and al sector; will face a skills shortage. most governments and private sector companies globally are competing to attract data scientists, data architects, coders and many of the professions needed to build data and al capabilities. the same actors are making efforts to attract talent from overseas but they also invest in the development of their own workforce: while this strategy aims at attracting foreign talent; it is crucial for the country to sustainably develop local talent and to provide the necessary incentives fof them to stay in saudi arabia: developing local talent requires to concentrater on three categories of the workforce natiohal strategy for data and ai  key



. data al experts specialists committed to innovation activities data and al specialists graduates from the field and who can potentially support its development general workforce labor force not necessarily working on data al topics but whose literacy in the field needs to be strengthened for the three categories, there should be an adapted effort in order to build the local workforce. within the framework of this strategy, we aim at creating educational tracks in data and al in k- and university degrees, some of which leading to specialist tracks supported by educational scholarships and professional training: we are also strengthening our cooperation with academic institutions while developing a certification program to recognize the efforts of professionals interested in developing data and ai skills objective  enact the most welcoming legislation for data and al businesses and talents our goal is to develop welcoming; flexible, and stable regulatory frameworks and incentives schemes to attract companies, investors and talents. regulations will also focus on developing adaptive policy frameworks and standards on data and al including the ethical use of al. these policies will provide direction to stakeholders and certainty over data and al activities. as part of providing an attractive regulatory framework for data and al investments and businesses, we aim at having strong framework to promote and support ethical development of data and al research and solutions this framework will provide guidelines for the development of our data protection and privacy standards. this is beneficial to both society as well as businesses and investors who need a stable regulatory framework to operate in the kingdom: national strategy for data and ai  key



. in addition, the creation of and access to open data is a crucial asset which any strong data and al ecosystem will need. opening government data provides significant opportunities to public and private sector organizations as well as individuals it would contribute to creating an attractive environment for startups, provide visibility on policy formation; decision-making and drive economic growth and innovation therefore, our ambition is to roll-out open data by default the implication being that all government data should be published as long as it does not compromise security, data protection, and privacy: however; this initiative requires a strong regulatory framework to provide high standards in terms of data protection and privacy, in line with our ethical approach to developing our data sector: doing this would define the framework through which government and private organizations will be able to benefit from the opportunities provided by data: the regulatory framework will include specifications on data collection, classification, sharing, open data policy and freedom of information: in order to achieve this, we will collaborate across government to ensure data is captured in readable formats, then start publishing the most timely and comprehensive datasets, to ultimately roll-out open data by default across government entities after . this illustrates our effort to facilitate access to public data for organizations contributing to the development of the sector this process starts with data collection where a standardized format will be required to capture data, followed by the publication of initial datasets from selected government organizations (ministries, agencies, or other), to test adoption from interested organizations this two-step initial phase would take place over the - period before transitioning to scaling our open data by default program across the whole-of-government from  onwards national strategy rata1ax



.   initiate adopt scale and excel launch government - publish additional roll-out open data wide open data data sets from by default across policy and ensure that select ministries government data is captured in a with the most timely readable form and comprehensive data sets in collaboration with ndmo and sector regulators - + enable entities to mature, create data open critical mass and enforce regulations by default ongoing efforts are made under vision  to promote doing business in the kingdom: our objective as part of this strategy is to ensure private sector development ambitions also benefit data and al. therefore, we will build an incentive package aimed at attracting foreign companies and facilitating the creation of local businesses in the data and al sector: this would encourage foreign firms to invest in the kingdom and facilitate knowledge transfer to empower local firms:



. objective  attract efficient, stable funding for qualified data and al investment opportunities our goal is to incentivize and enable local and foreign investors to effectively identify and fund available data and al investment opportunities in ksa we will build targeted funds and investor support programs to attract and guide domestic and foreign investments in data and al: the data and al sector in ksa will need large amounts of investments to grow: these investments can be encouraged by a fund that adds incentives by reducing the risk of subsidizing returns therefore, we will setup a fund/financial mechanism incentivizing foreign direct investment local investments in data and al priority areas_ we will invest in relevant cutting-edge data and al applications to the ksa market and new promising technologies to first-mover advantage. we will also setup an investors' support program providing professional services such as investment screening and business plan development: the ace of technological innovation in the data and al sector generates a continuous need to adapt our support would provide guidance to both foreign and domestic investors on the saudi ecosystem in terms of domestic financial facilities, the regulatory framework as well as the business ecosystem (high potential startups, projects, and planned initiatives): national strategy fok data ai  gain key



. objective  empower top data and al institutions to spearhead innovation and impact creation fostering an environment conducive to innovation is a critical element for data and al exploration. our goal is to elevate the quantity and quality of data and al rel capabilities including researchers, equipment; topics, commercialization vehicles, while expanding the capacity in new areas in data and al: ksa has and unique offering for innovation, as it is currently developing multiple giga-projects where technology is a central high-priority: the proliferation of these new and smart cities will constitute the best environment for new and creative use of data and ai. these cities will become test-beds to innovative use of al across multiple domains such as policies and regulations, and algorithms and applications development: we will aim to develop specialized clusters and hubs focused on providing a collaborative and forward thinking environment for researchers to come and explore the latest data and al possibilities as a result; innovation and research are expected to be centered not only around technological development but also in terms of data and al policies and regulations, developing ethical frameworks and the integration of al-enabled solutions into megacities' design: we will also focus on expanding current data and al randi capabilities. as a result, we aim at increasing the number of high quality rel papers to capture the most promising initiatives and contribute to the advancement of the sector globally: this will require close cooperation with both international and domestic academic institutions: national strategy for data and al 



. objective  stimulate data and al adoption with the most collaborative, and forward-thinking ecosystem one of the key success factors for data and al strategies will be attributed to the adoption of innovative solutions enabled by data and al, across the public and private sectors, as well as individuals developing a robust digital infrastructure that developers could utilize would be of utmost importance. in addition, public awareness of ongoing activities will be key to ensuring citizen understanding of the benefits generated by the fast emergence of a high number of data and al practical applications we will also develop sector-specific data and al plans. these sectors will be identified based on the current digital maturity of each sector; alignment with vision  objectives and data and al expected impact: in fact; while all sectors will be disrupted to a certain extent, some sectors will expect major shifts due to data and al: in order to promote nation-wide al adoption and utilization, it is crucial to provide the opportunity for individuals and small businesses to access well-established and sophisticated data and al platforms. we will develop sector-focused partnerships in the domain of data and al platforms and provide accessible data and al platforms at country level through partnerships with major companies with efficient and sophisticated platforms. promoting close cooperation within the ecosystem to include all key stakeholders such as the government; businesses, academic institutions, financial actors and the general public to develop linkages which are essential to achieve scale. national strategy for data ala

ethical ai framework overview . overview of the ethical a framework . vision for the ethical ai framework the vision for the ethical al framework is to enable organisations to manage potential ethical issues and implications through assessing their ai capabilities and applications. this   enables delivery of ethical ai whilst managing the potential impact of al applications. the   purpose of this   section is to   provide an overview of the ethical ai framework for organisations. examples used are taken from different sources and are purely for illustrative purposes only. . objectives the objectives of the ethical ai framework are: to support organisations to understand ethical al and its applications by: establishing ethical ai principles with definitions, practices and guidelines; and defining roles and responsibilities for organisations when implementing ethical ai: to the ethical use of al in organisations by: providing a description of activities to be covered throughout all stages of the ai lifecycle and the corresponding capabilities required to apply ethical ai; and providing practical guidelines for organisations to observe and apply when incorporate ai in it projects to ensure ethical adoption. to assist organisations to govern the compliance of al applications providing an ai application impact assessment template that enables organisations to assess their al application over a set of practical considerations for implementing ethical ai . benefits the adoption of ethical ai framework is a foundation step that establishes a common approach and structure to govern the subsequent development and deployment of al applications benefits ofhaving an ethical ai framework include: establishing common best practices to ensure organisations have guidance and references to adopt al in it projects with appropriate ethical considerations identifying the benefits, risks and impacts of an ai application to enable better risk mitigation decisions that maximise benefits. acting as a bridge   between the strategy and  execution which helps ensure the ai application is aligned with organisations vision and needs. - guide they by:



ethical ai framework overview . introduction to ai and data ethics in the age of big data, enormous quantities of data are being generated, collected and analysed to identify insights and support decisions making: big data are often described in terms of the five vs where: volume refers to the vast quantity of the data available; velocity refers to the at which data must be stored and/or analysed to provide the right information at the right time to make appropriate management decisions; variety refers to a huge variation in types and sources of data including both structure and unstructured data (e.g: file objects, social media feeds, tags, data from sensors, audio, image and video); veracity refers to the trustworthiness of the data over its accuracy and quality; and value refers to the ability to transform data to improve outcomes/values. analytical techniques that are used to analyse big data are often being described as advanced analytics, machine learning and ai. these technical terms have similar meanings and overlap with each other: they all refer to analytic operations that take advantage of volume data describing the past   situations  (i.e. historical data), and massive  processing   capabilities   and advanced algorithms, and that use them to find correlations and make predictions with acceptable accuracy: in a broad definition, al is a collective term for computer systems that can sense their environment, think, learn and take actions in response to the gathered data, with the ultimate of fulfilling their objectives. al systems are a collection of interrelated technologies used to help solve problems autonomously and perform tasks to achieve defined objectives without explicit guidance from a human being: we can distinguish the four main categories of ai (see figure ):  www ibm com/blogs/watson-health/the-s-vs-of-big-data/ - speed large - goal design

ethical ai framework overview principle definition sustainability and just the ai development should ensure that mitigation strategies are transition in place to manage any potential societal and environmental system impacts  table : ethical al principles and definitions ... transparency and interpretability principle: organisations  should be able to explain decision-making processes of the ai applications to humans in a clear and comprehensible manner: interpretability is the notion of creating human-understandable explanations of an al model'$ characteristics (e.g. features and parameters), as well as the decision-making pathways for each individual prediction. such interpretations may be of interest to various stakeholders of ai. related areas include understanding ai, ensuring models are explainable, transparency of processes, reproducibility and trust. across both global and local literature, it is recognised there is a need to be able to explain what ai actually does in a clear way. to create robust and trusted ai applications, an understanding of inner functioning of their models, as well as the data used at training and decision-making times is imperative. organisations should be interested in understanding the inner workings of al models to evaluate   and   establish trust in  utilising ai-driven solutions and make more confident decisions; data scientists may consult interpretation reports to decide whether a model should be deployed, or to facilitate better communication and collaboration with their peers, system analysts, system architects and managers; and governance bodies may require comprehensive and immutable interpretation reports ofan al model for auditing purposes. whatever the case may be, this necessitates an ethical principle that obliges ai developers to consider building interpretability capabilities into al applications. interpretability methods can be used to   generate   textual or visual   explanations of  models from two different perspectives, depending on the use case and stakeholders. please refer to section ... ""business and data   understanding""    for   further details. for  those   complicated  machine learning algorithms (e.g: neural networks), hyper-parameters of algorithms should be properly documented. for example, for al applications involving the use of neural networks, hyper- parameters   such as  number of layers, activation  functions  and error  functions should be properly documented. interpretability can encompass   explainability, transparency and  provability which are explained below. -



ethical ai framework overview explainability explainability refers to the degree to which a decision made by an ai application can be understood by a human expert. depending on whether the data, algorithms and configurations of an ai model are available at the time of interpretation, two approaches can be taken to generate human-readable explanations: built-in interpretation: some models inherently have the ability to explain their behaviour. for example, decision trees are essentially a cascade of questions and work comparably to the way humans think. when executing against a data (using its features and values)_ the pathways to reach a decision can be simply reported back to human users. similarly, linear models like logistic regression are fairly intuitive and easy to explain to a non- expert in data science, as the data points can be visualised in a plot against the learned probability line, and feature importance metrics can be calculated, and absolute values reported back to data scientists post-hoc interpretation: post-hoc   interpretation of an ai model is an effort beyond exploratory data analysis  techniques to understand its behaviour after it has  finished training, o when the model is in production and only accessible through an application programming interface (~apt ). while post-hoc interpretation is less likely to elucidate the exact inner workings of a model, it can help end-users to approximate the behaviour of the model by way of examples, surrogate models or visualisation of feature importance and partial dependence plots. depending on which stakeholder is on the receiving end of the interpretation, natural language explanations of a model's behaviour can be generated using techniques from the natural language generation ( nlg"") domain to create. note, there is an  inherent  trade-off between  explainability and accuracy of machine learning algorithms. nonparametric machine learning algorithms o models with a very large number of parameters (e.g. deep neural networks or ensemble models) can learn complex, latent   patterns from large-scale data and offer   flexibility and   superior performance, at the cost of being *opaque"" in nature. in contrast; parametric models, such as naive bayesian or simple neural networks, that can be trained with a set of fixed parameters are easier to explain but often are less performant though this is not always the case. in addition to the type, size and complexity of training data that usually dictate the learning models, the safety-critical nature of the ai application and desired level of explanation should be considered at design time. transparency transparency is notably the most critical characteristic of building trust into al models. trust is dynamic, developed and strengthened in a gradual manner: it is realised through carefully designing a process to minimise risk, and therefore, plays a crucial role in the widespread adoption of new, disruptive technologies like ai. trust is hard to come by and builds upon several   factors including purpose and performance of the ai applications, as well as the technology provider (e.g organisation's brand reputation, level of transparency in operations, reliability and being able to explain the rationale behind the al models decisions are crucial  for building and maintaining trusts the transparency principle calls  for the - point design;



ethical ai framework overview adoption of a clear; honest communication channel between an organisation and its end-users and regulators, when needed, and its indispensable nature. the stochastic nature of ai applications makes them fundamentally different from conventional software development paradigms in what follows, we iterate possible ways of embedding transparency into the design of al applications based on institute of electrical and electronics engineers ( ieee"") standards: transparency as traceability: the transparency of the software engineering process during implementation that should   allow technical   inspection of which norms have been implemented, explicitly and implicitly, for which contexts, and how possible conflicts are resolved. transparency as verifiability: this concerns how normative reasoning is approached in the implementation and how it is possible to verify that the normative decisions the system makes match the   required norms and values using possibly explicit and exact representations with the objective to provide the basis for a range of strong mathematical techniques, such as formal verification: verifiability is also important in case of failure, in the sense that if an ai application causes harm, it should be possible to ascertain why, in case of judicial decision-making involving an ai model, it must be possible to provide satisfactory explanation auditable by a competent human authoritys. transparency as non-deception and honest design: stakeholder of the global ai community has a strong and shared interest in avoiding al applications autonomously creating any information or content in any form (text; audio, video) that intentionally represent states of the world that do not correspond partially or entirely to specific states of fact with the intent of deceiving any third-party (human or machines). of course, in certain use cases   of ai application   deception may be necessary in  serving the core functionality of the system (e.g. in case of gaming, entertainment and art applications), but those actions are no longer norm violations because are justified by context and user consent?. transparency as personal privacy: people should have the right to access, manage and control the data generate and that can be used by ai applications common misconception regarding transparency is a belief that organisations must reveal their a-related intellectual property (e.g. source code, models' configurations, comprehensive views of their data sets  to provide for a ""transparent al . on the contrary, the transparency principle  calls   for the   adoption of a clear; honest   communication channel   between an organisation and its end-users and regulators, when needed, and its indispensable nature. otherwise, the for-profit"" nature of many al applications, as well as third-party al vendors` business models would never allow organisations to adhere to this principle. in fact; having a very detailed transparency level with end-users of an ai application would possibly make it susceptible to being gamed"" by malicious users. at the same time, auditors and regulators may require accurate, exhaustive views into the organisation's al-driven processes. in such cases, the level of transparency may be decided by the organisation as seen fit:  istandards iece org/content/dam/iccc-standards/standards/web/documents/other/ead_v2 pdf  //standards iecc org/content/dam/icce-standards/standards/web/documents/other/ead_v2 pdf - and any beings they they



ethical ai framework overview provability provability refers to the mathematical certainty behind al models' decisions. it mandates a higher level of formalism in   explaining an ai   application' $ behaviour. this   type of interpretability is geared more towards data scientists to place an al model under scrutiny to ensure the decision-making policies of the model can be mathematically proved and remain consistent as changes in data and environment take place. equitably, in many safety-critical ai applications, where the use of al must be approved or certified by regulators, provability becomes indispensable. examples_(please refer_to_section  al practice guide ' for further_examples and practices) project team should aim to embed elements of transparency into the al applications and translate them into human language decision treelillustration to explain to users how decisions are made) this allows human to understand whether the decision made by ai has errors and fix the errors_ provide examples to explain the al decision-making process in narrative terms or graphics (for example, drawing a workflow with decision trees) whenever possible for a non-technical audience to understand and visualise the al operations better: organisations should make explicit how different factors and data determine the outcomes and conclusions of their ai models ... reliability, robustness and security principle: like other it applications, al applications should be developed such that will operate reliably over periods of time using the right models and datasets while ensuring are both robust (i.e. providing consistent results and capable to handle errors) and remain secure against cyber-attacks as required by the relevant legal and industry frameworks. the overarching aim of the reliability, robustness and security principle is to ensure that al applications behave as intended, from training data to final output, over prolonged periods of time. reliability is about increasing the likelihood of the system being fault-free. robustness is to ensure that models perform when assumptions and variables change. security is to protect the data and model itself: across both global and local literature, it is recognised there is a need to ensure al applications behave as intended. areas in the literature include awareness of misuse, integrity, robustness, resilience, effectiveness, quality, appropriateness, accuracy and security. in particular, there is a focus on preventing harm: it is an indispensable requirement for al applications to be designed and developed in a way that takes into consideration that environment; data and processes o which rely, change over time. malevolent actors of ai applications can exploit such drifts in the al operating - (e.g: using they long they they



ethical ai framework overview environment with a variety of techniques to penetrate and fool al models to make incorrect predictions with high confidence: the adoption of the reliability, robustness and security principle assists organisations to identify potential weaknesses in an al application, improve overall performance, withstand adversarial attacks, and monitor long term performance of ai models throughout their operational lifetime, and verifiably so where applicable and feasible. reliability fundamental to creating reliable software applications, reliability is an engineering effort to maximise the probability that a system will perform its required functions fault-free within a specified time period and the environments as the complexity of al algorithms and systems built upon them increases, the role of disciplined software engineering practices, such as standards and software tests, become more prominent to ensure two measures encompassed in reliability: availability: the degree to which a system o component is operational and accessible when required, often expressed as a probability'. in safety-critical o real-time missions, the availability of al applications is of high significance and the absence thereof can lead to potentially fatal consequences. serviceability: sometimes also referred to as maintainability, is the degree of ease with which a system can be maintained o repaired. changes to the infrastructure where ai systems are running , the requirements that al models have to fulfil, as well as issues and bugs that surface over time, require the al developers to periodically correct defects, analyse their root causes and prevent future failures. while quality and integrity are applicable to individuals adhering to industry best practices and organisational codes of conduct; it is also important that organisations closely monitor and manage the quality and integrity of the data being used to develop al applications data quality' determines the reliability of the information to serve an  intended purpose and attributes that define the usability of information, whereas data integrity refers to the reliability ofinformation in terms of its physical and logical validity - based on accuracy and consistency of the data across its lifecycle the absence of unintended change to the information between successive   updates. the considerations relating to data   quality and   integrity are consistency, accuracy, validity, timeliness, uniqueness and completeness. robustness robustness is a characteristic describing a model's ability to effectively perform while its variables or assumptions are altered: in order to ensure a model is robust; validations and error handling must be incorporated at every step of the data science pipeline, from data preparation and ingestion through to prediction: robust models must perform consistently while being exposed to a new and independent (but http i www mitjyu filope/kurssitties462 /materiaalit/ieee_softwarcengglossary pdf http i www mitjyu filope/kurssitties462 /materiaalit/ieee_softwarcengglossary pdf - key



ethical ai framework overview similar) datasets and be able to deal with the errors and corner cases that occur at execution time. robustness also entails placing effective error handling measures in place to protect al models when exposed to malicious inputs and parameters. security many of existing security practices conventional to software development efforts are also applicable for ai and machine learning models. as largely rely on data curated and integrated with public or third-party sources, they must be able to discern between malicious input and benign anomalous data. when designing security protocols extra care should be taken to cleanse, secure and encrypt data, as well as designing access controls to the trained model. adversarial attacks, the act of introducing small, intentional perturbations to data used to compel ai models to make incorrect predictions with high confidence, is one of such security risks. additionally, for organisations that do not provide direct access to their al models, but expose them as web services, designing security protocols that prevent attackers from reverse engineering their model is necessary: examples (please refer to section  ai practice guide ' for further examples and practices_ ai systems should be technically robust, and should be protected from any malicious use. malicious actors can try to deceive al models with inputs designed to learn about the ai and deceive it: controls are necessary to ensure that the al application will not be exposed to potential hackers who will train the al model to perform tasks it was not intended to perform: when such cases happen, this will lead to liability and reputational risk to the organisation using the al application: continuous monitoring which includes validation;, verification of accuracy and maintenance of the model should be performed regularly to improve the security and robustness of ai. this is because hackers usually look for outdated software with security flaws which are more vulnerable to cyberattacks. constantly   updating the ai application, this will minimise such security risks. ... fairness principle:   the recommendation/result  from the ai applications should treat individuals within similar groups in a fair manner, without favouritism or discrimination and without causing o resulting in harm: this entails maintaining respect for the individuals behind the data and refraining from using datasets that contain discriminatory biases. with regards to fairness, article  of the universal declaration of human rights states that everyone is entitled t0 all the rights and freedoms set forth in this declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex; language, religion, political or other opinions, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. furthermore, no distinction - they i,e.- they by



ethical ai framework overview shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty"" it is therefore important for al applications to limit discrimination or bias relative to the factors reported in the article. the same principle against discrimination is included in the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women: the following is a list of key legal terminology for consideration when understanding fairness  and how it applies to organisations o al applications implementation: prejudice: prejudice means to injure or harm a person'$ rights. discrimination:  discrimination means the   adverse, unfair or detrimental treatment; preference, exclusion o distinction of a person because of the person '$ race, colour, sex, sexual orientation, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family or   carer' $ responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction o social origin: impartiality: impartiality means to act or make a decision based 0n merit and according to the law without bias, influence, preconception or unreasonableness. positive discrimination: positive discrimination means the: treatment of a person; taking of an action affecting a person; and/or making of a decision affecting a person because of that person s race, colour; sex; sexual orientation, age, physical o mental disability, marital status, family or carer'$ responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or  social origin that is done with the intention of achieving: substantive equality; equal enjoyment; equal exercise of human rights; and/or equal exercise of fundamental freedoms for that person. it is   paramount to   acknowledge that fairess is a social construct. there are many mathematical definitions of fairness, and when we choose one, we violate some aspects of the others. in other words, it is impossible for every decision to be truly fair to all parties. no ai application can be universally fair or unbiased""i . however, al applications can be designed to meet specific fairness goals, thus mitigating some of the perceived unfairness and creating a more responsible system overall. examples_(please refer to_section  al practice guide ' for further_examples and practices) training data should be free from any bias characteristics such as sample size disparity (where there is significantly less data for minority groups), selection bias (where certain groups are less likely to be selected); bias in model design and bias in model use and feedback (e.g: by checking for stereotyping certain groups when relying on data and  please note that often there is no universal legal meaning for these words/phrases and that particular definitions can differ based on their purpose and the circumstances of that situation. therefore, in this context the definitions are purposefully broad and relatively simple; taking into account the context in which are t0 be used (i.e_ broad-based decision-making framework)  www strategy-business com/article what-is-fair-when-it-comes-to-al-bias?gko_-82zc0 http |www jennwv com/papers/checklists_pdf - they



ethical ai framework overview algorithms) if the ai application is biased, the decisions made will show preference towards certain groups of individuals. ensure integrity of source data   obtained to help ensure a fair outcome from the ai application data which are invalid or inaccurate, when used to train an ai model, will lead to biased decisions and affected users will be discriminated unintentionally due to the flaw in datasets. ... diversity and inclusion principle: inclusion and diverse usership through the ai application should be promoted by understanding and respecting the interests of all stakeholders impacted. this principle works under the assumption that local cultural norms do not contradict either any general o performance principles. al can be used globally by a great variety of people their interpretation of the an ai application behaves can consequently differ: to achieve diversity and inclusion, it is important to involve the largest possible number of al users representing the broadest variety of cultures, interests, lifestyles and disciplines. examples (please refer to section  ai practice guide ""' for further examples and practices): ai application developers should always consider people of different backgrounds, races and gender. if such differences were not considered, the ai application might behave differently   towards certain groups of  individuals  causing  inconvenience. one such example is alrecruiting tool showing preference towards caucasians because the tool was developed by caucasians. ... human oversight principle: the degree of human intervention required as part of al application's decision- making or operations should be dictated by the level of the perceived severity of ethical issues. human oversight is the capability ofhumans in making choices that is to think and determine an outcome and consequently enact upon it. ai applications are regarded as autonomous systems to various degrees and as become prevalent in our lives, their function in real- world contexts is often correlated with fear and uncertainty. examples_(please refer to_section  al practice guide"" for further examples and practices) ensure an appropriate level of human intervention based on multiple factors such as the benefits and risks of the al application; impacts of the al decision, operational cost and - way they



ethical ai framework overview evolving societal norms and values. having some level of human intervention will also reduce job displacement risk: controls should be implemented that allow for human intervention o auto-shutdown in the event of system failure especially when the system failure will have an impact on human safety. one such example is autonomous vehicle where human should be given the to prevent the vehicle from causing accidents if it failed to detect human on the road. ... lawfulness and compliance principle: organisations responsible for an al application should always act in accordance with the law and regulations and relevant regulatory regimes. in all cases, the principles that al applications must adhere to are contained in international treaties or regulations as well as in national legislations and industry standards. it is therefore indispensable for any organisation dealing with the development 0r implementation of ai applications to master and apply consistently all relevant obligations emanated by legislative sources at any level. examples_(please refer_to_section 4_ al practice guide ' for further_examples and practices) ai system developed must be in compliance with regulations and laws ifthere are no laws to the use of ai, humans with bad intentions will develop al applications that will cause harm. compliance review processes for al applications should be defined to keep track of regulatory changes and to ensure that the policies and processes are compliant. ... data privacy principle: individuals should have the right to: a be informed ofthe purpose of collection and potential transferees of their personal data and that personal data shall only be collected for a lawful purpose, by using lawful and fair means, and that the amount of personal data collected should not be excessive in relation to the purpose. please refer to the data protection principles (dpp"")l ""purpose and manner of collection"" of the personal data (privacy) ordinance (the ""pd(p)o ) b be assured that data users take all practicable steps to ensure that personal data are accurate and is not kept longer than is necessary. please refer to the dppz accuracy and duration of retention"" of the pd(p)o. require that personal data shall only be used for the original purpose of collection and any directly related purposes. otherwise, express and voluntary consent of the individuals is required. please refer to the dpp3 ""use of personal data' of the pd(p)o: - option govern

ethical ai framework overview could arise in which al applications attempt to take control over their own reward systems or where the learning system fails with unpredictable consequences. it is also necessary to determine who is responsible for what and to this regard it is possible to say that designers and builders of advanced ai applications are stakeholders in the moral implications of their use, misuse, and actions, with a responsibility and opportunity to shape those implications examples_(please refer_to_section 4_ al practice guide ' for further_examples and practices) where al tools are used to augment human in decision-making, they should be safe, trustworthy, and aligned with the ethics and preferences of people who are influenced by their actions. if robots are deployed to provide care for the elderly, the robot should not cause physical o mental harm to the elderly. ... accountability principle: organisations are responsible for the moral implications of their use and misuse of ai applications. there   should also be a clearly identifiable   accountable party, be it an individual or an organisational entity (e:g: the al solution provider) accountability ensures the responsibilities and liability of stakeholders are made clear and that people can be held accountable. this includes ensuring that responsibilities are fulfilled from planning through to record-keeping: accountability is a fundamental mentioned in literature both locally and globally. it is a cornerstone   principle  in most   privacy  frameworks and/or legislation: it is  necessary to determine who is responsible for what, and in this regard, it is possible to say that designers and builders of advanced ai systems are stakeholders in the moral implications of their use, misuse and actions, with a responsibility and opportunity to shape those implications accountability is into action through a comprehensive, end-to-end governance process. governance   typically  refers  to the   collective set  of policies, procedures   and  oversight internally and externally that manages the risk of systems and meets required obligations. this will help management of ethical responsibilities and assist to track and mitigate risks related to big data and al projects. by introducing an appropriate governance framework, this can balance the need for innovation within the organisation and the need to safeguard the public interest. examples (please refer to section  ai practice guide ""' for further examples and practices) people and organisations responsible for the creation and implementation of alalgorithms should be identifiable and accountable for the impacts ofthat algorithm, even if the impacts are unintended. when ai causes damage and there is no responsible party, the end user affected will not be compensated fairly. - being put

ethical ai framework overview any type of stakeholders, ranging from end-user to universities, research centres, governments and professional associations in order to help to mitigate the risk of exclusion and inherent biases within the ai application: examples (please refer to section  ai practice guidel for further examples and practices): organisations should actively seek to develop and enhance al application cross domain, cross sector and cross organisation. if there is no cooperation between different teams, the ai model may make biased decisions due to lack of diverse opinions/user testing: project managers can work together with the project team as well as end-users to perform testing before deployment. ... sustainability and just transition principle: the ai development should ensure that mitigation strategies are in place to manage any potential societal and environmental system impacts. ai can help transform traditional sectors and systems to societal and environmental challenges as well as bolster human well-being: although ai presents transformative opportunities to address some of the societal and environmental challenges, left unguided, it also has the capability to accelerate the society and environment's degradation the deployment of ai applications potentially carries profound societal and environmental impacts as in the case of worker displacement or in the areas of caring for the elderly, sick and disabled (e.g. can ai robots replace humans and how does this impact people being cared for), education and planet preservation: to develop a sustainable ai, the ultimate is to ensure that it becomes values- aligned with humanity, promising safe application of technology for humankind. in practice, this means checks and balances developed to ensure that evolving ai applications remain sustainable. this means that there is a need to guarantee that ai applications (with possible societal and environmental impacts= are implemented with an appropriate mitigation plan: examples (please refer to section  ai practice guide ""' for further examples and practices) ai system can be used to contribute to lesser carbon footprint: ai technology can be used to optimise power utilisation at data centres and help save energy. ai technology infrastructure should be scalable to sustain for long-term enhancements. if the ai applications were developed on infrastructure that could not be scaled-up, this may lead to limitations in the future for fine-tuning of model. - goal

ethical ai framework overview in a typical development process of an al application, great emphasis is placed on data because data are often required for creating a ai model. data sourcing and preparation which is of the project development can be a continuous exercise. this is because an ai model can often benefit from better or more data for iterative model training throughout the development process. the approach of conventional software lifecycle is to program the it application with a set of instructions for a pre-defined set of events. thereafter; the it application will exploit its computing capabilities and other resources to process the data fed into the system: this is different from an ai application where a huge amount of data are fed into the application, which in turn processes all the data resulting in a trained model o al solution: this trained model is then used to solve new problems. there is often a continual feedback loop between the development and deployment stages, as well as system operation and monitoring of the ai lifecycle for iterative improvements making this distinct from a traditional software development lifecycle. - good good part

executive summary artificial intelligence (al) has the potential to dramatically improve lives and livelihoods across the republic of rwanda,; as well as make remarkable progress towards achievement of national development and economic objectives and sustainable development goals. however; while the development and economic opportunities of al are huge, are inextricably connected with risks which require ethical principles and precautions: the national artificial intelligence policy for the republic of rwanda serves as a roadmap to enable rwanda to harness the benefits of al and mitigate its risks. building on the mission of the vision , smart rwanda master plan and other national plans and policies, it equips rwanda to harness al for sustainable and inclusive growth. by mobilizing local, regional, and international stakeholders, it positions rwanda to become a leading african innovation hub and africa's centre of excellence in artificial intelligence the national al policy has been developed by minict and rura, with support by giz fair forward, the centre for the 4th industrial revolution rwanda (c4ir) and the future society (tfs): the national al policy, which promotes and fosters rwanda's inclusive and sustainable socio-economic transformation; is oriented around the following vision and mission statements. vision mission to become a global center for al to leverage al to power economic growth, research and innovation improve quality of life and position rwanda as a global innovator for responsible and inclusive al national objectives the rwanda al policy aims to achieve the following national objectives: positioning rwanda as africa's al lab and responsible al champion building 21st century skills and al literacy creating an open, secure, trusted data ecosystem as an enabler of the al revolution driving public sector transformation to fuel al adoption accelerating responsible al adoption in the private sector they key



the diagnostic assessment of rwanda's al ecosystem identifies important opportunities and constraints that enable or mitigate al adoption: it identifies the areas requiring policy inter- ventions to accelerate, enable and scale rwanda's al ecosystem: as such, it serves as the foun- dational knowledge base for policy recommendations to harness rwanda's strengths, overcome its weaknesses and threats, and ultimately take advantage of important opportunities for and vibrant al ecosystem: six priority policy areas have been identified to accelerate the responsible development and deployment of al across the nation: each of the priority areas is organized as enablers, accelerators or safeguards as depicted in the image below: rwanda national al policy: six priority areas 21st century skills reliable infrastructure robust enablers high al literacy computer capacity data strategy  trustworthy al adoption widely-beneficial al accelerators in the public sector adoption in one private sector safeguard practical ethical guidelines 



key policy recommendations commit to reskilling the workforce with 21st century al and data skills: globally, emerging technologies starting with al are transforming and reshaping our soci- eties and labor markets rwanda's workforce needs to be equipped with the skills to flourish in this transition and remain competitive in the regional and global landscape: the government will invest in and develop a national skills building program prioritizing al and data skills combined with a young professionals/apprenticeship program to devel- op al talent and career opportunities in the knowledge economy: set the foundations for world-class al university education and applied research: investment in talent is a stepping stone for an al economy: through the policy; the government in partnership with the private sector will establish a public-private funded program for al skills building at the university level with research fellowships, phds and masters degrees, and long-term public-sector funding to universities to build capacity in al education and research by attracting researchers and partnering with global universi- ties:  adapt rwanda's education to ensure the young learners are empowered with globally competitive stem skills: an al economy requires long-term investment in human capital beginning at the primary education level. rwanda's school curricula shall adapt for the age of al, data and digital technologies, with the government investing in and creating a teacher corps to provide the support and training to young learners in al and data-related subjects. streamline the exchange of students and professionals between rwanda and foreign countries: building on the strategy to become a regional hub on the african continent; rwanda has the opportunity to become a leader in al education and research by attracting and retain- ing talent from across africa and around the world: ensure access to affordable, reliable and secure high performance storage and com- capacity: strong compute power is necessary to train al models on large data sets. today; access to compute to drive al adoption is a challenge for start-ups and industry: we need to provide mechanisms to enable access to international and world-class cloud computing services which offer competitive performance and cost for rwandan companies and the research community, in order to facilitate and fast track al adoption: position rwanda as a host for cloud infrastructure with al-ready storage and compute capacity serving the region and the continent: digital infrastructure is essential for the growth and penetration of regional integration. by investing in critical infrastructure and partnering with global players while also building the local skills required to manage and maintain the infrastructure, rwanda has the opportunity to develop a national cloud infrastructure and techno-industrial base, and increase rwanda's regional competitiveness:  key pute



create pathways to greater availability and accessibility of al-ready data. data is the energy that will fuel rwanda as africa's al hub, but today there is a lack of digi- tized data and most data from the public and private sector remain inaccessible: the government will set up a multi-sectoral task force to develop data governance frame- works and protocols with standards for sharing data ethically, responsibly and securely and provide guidance for the public sector to migrate data to digital format and improve al-readiness of public data.  strengthen al policy and regulation and ensure public trust in al trust is critical to public confidence and acceptance of al. strengthening the capacity of regulatory authorities to understand and regulate al aligned with emerging global standards and best practices, we will build transparency and trust with the public collaborate in measuring international al development and rwanda's global competi- tiveness. international collaboration is essential to drive sustainable development in ai. the gov- ernment will establish international partnerships, building upon international al readiness indexes and benchmark rwanda's al competitiveness and capacity in an annual 'al read- iness index' in order to help drive development of al in rwanda and spur local, regional, continental and global investment in al foundations:  improve public service delivery using al. ai has the potential to improve performance and efficiency of public services, but few ministries and public sector agencies are currently harnessing it: we will invest in raising awareness of the benefits through piloting, demonstrations and building capacity to implement and manage al projects, delivering improved public services. using policy tools, the government will engage local al solution providers through innovation-friendly procurement processes, organize training sessions, invest in hackathons, prizes and challenges to open opportunities for responsible al applications in the public sector; and establish a risk sharing fund to support randd in the public sector: support private sector adoption and prioritization of al in order to drive robust invest- ments in al at a national level: the private sector is a critical partner in driving penetration and adoption of al within the wider economy; companies may perceive adopting new technologies as challenging and risky and may lack the internal capacity and resources required. in order to demystify al, we will identify a portfolio of high potential al use cases and projects aligned with the national agenda that can inform investment prioritization for the private and public sectors. we will also facilitate al adoption through al meet-ups and demonstrations to raise al and data literacy. al is of national and critical importance and hence we will raise the profile of al at a national level through the establishment of a presidential council on al composed of al academic and industry leaders to provide advice to the government and private sector  boost rwanda's emerging al ecosystem: ^ challenge for the start-up community is access to business resources and financ- ing: we will facilitate collaboration among the start-up, industry and research communi- ties in a rwanda ai program' to jointly develop al innovations and solutions for industry and government challenges, in order to bring together the much-needed resources to catalyze the al ecosystem: by yet key



the government will also support the financing by building upon the seed investment fund to co-invest alongside specialist funds to invest in al companies.  operationalize and share rwanda's al ethical guidelines: ethical and safety precautions are required to ensure that al solutions benefit citizens and do not cause harm: the government will promote rwanda's 'guidelines on the ethi- cal development and implementation of al' throughout the al community; led by rura launch an annual participatory consultation forum to update the guidelines and create and network of al ethics officers across government institutions to champion them: actively contribute to shaping responsible al principles practices in international platforms: global al policymaking has already begun, and rwanda will seek to participate in the global fora on al, sharing rwandan perspectives and interests and learning from interna- tional practices: join platforms shaping the responsible adoption of al regionally and globally (e.g: oecd, unesco, itu, gpai, world bank; undp; giz, pdpc, smart africa, african union, wefigaia): the framework includes a sectoral deep-dive focusing on accelerating responsible al adoption in identified sectors for rwanda: pay healthcare banking e-commerce transportation agriculture digital payments trade  public administration manufacturing construction and education these sectors were identified through the consultation process as flagship sectors where al adoption can result in high rewards. each sector is articulated with a description of the maturity of al adoption in the sector; key actors, opportunities, challenges and key recommendations: although al generates many opportunities and great potential to promote development; there are significant risks with many of its applications: hence, the national al policy also includes ethi- cal considerations to capture the opportunities for economic development and mitigate the risks of al. rwanda's guidelines on the ethical development and implementation of artificial intel- ligence, developed by rura address the range of risks in the al system lifecycle and consider- ations for responsible and trustworthy adoption of al in rwanda.  key

apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development executive summary there is a shared motivation among african and global policymakers to improve the livelihoods of the african people through socio-economic development aspirations known as the african union's (au) agenda  and the sustainable development goals (sdgs)_ these socio-economic development aspirations are representative of the shared energy and excitement around the growth potential of african member states. recent  projections have predicted that artificial intelligence (ai)-based technologies will potentially double the gross domestic product (gdp) growth rate of african countries by , regarding the long-term   socio-economic impact of al around the world. therefore, this means that harnessing even a fraction of the ai technologies would significantly contribute to the socio-economic development of the african continent and alleviate poverty through some economic sectors. the key economic sectors of interest include agriculture, healthcare, public services, mining, industry and financial services_ which ai-based technologies, supported by appropriate policies, ethical and legal frameworks can significantly upsurge growth and development. according to stisa-,african's agenda  and sdgs, africa to mobilise and promote the growth of a responsive ai-technology-based economic   system for africa continent_ hence, forward-thinking policymaking, innovative ai-based business start-ups, global ai technology partners, civil society groups, and international stakeholders are needed to attain these aspirations_ however there are structural and systematic policy developments that africa needs to adopt in order to advance healthy ai-based economic system for the african continent: this means that the educational system must be adapted much faster towards an a-focused education system with the view of creating employment opportunities for youth, especially among women and gender unsteadiness within stem fields has been reported to show that less than  of women are in the global scientific research community_ furthermore women are less than % in ai-related fields, more especially among researchers french-speaking  countries than  english-speaking countries thus, african countries need to bridge these stem issues. this imbalance will draw drastic consequences on the job market if this gap remains unaddressed. ai rh artificial intelligence cybernetics problem solving deep learning machine learning robotics neural networks the adaptation of ai technology into the african economy comes with inherent developmental challenges. notably, there have been misperceptions spread against al technologies. al has been projected to be posing grave and imminent danger to the future of humankind. for example, it has been predicted that unemployment and inequality may increase because of the adoption and implementation of al globally; thus, contributing to massive unemployment and further contribute to levels of inequality. this is based on the fact that al tools and ai-based artefacts may completely replace human activities in some sectors of the economy or develop into superior and uncontrollable however, this line of thinking fails to appreciate the potential and massive benefits from ai technologies implementation in the african   systems_ in contrast, it will take some time before generalised ai (strong al) machines, known as super-smart machines capable of functioning like humans, are fully developed and exploited: aspires global girls. from gender beings.



apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development furthermore , ai-based technologies are already enhancing the education, commerce, banking, healthcare, agriculture, and mining sectors _ therefore, african governments need to embrace these challenges and opportunities by creating appropriate guidelines   and policies such as legal, ethical, regulatory, safety and privacy  frameworks_ consequently , different african member states have been presenting numerous al strategies and investing in harnessing the rollout of ai technology for the socio-economic development of their countries, however, more investment in al technology is needed. some areas are indicated below_ policy and regulations: african countries must develop al-specific policies and strategies over the next five years. presently it is only kenya that has established an al task force focused on a national strategy, amongst all the au member states. thus african countries must form policy capacity, and further blueprint national, regional, and continental al regulatory frameworks that suit the african context. furthermore_ there is a need to investments   toward prioritised solutions for a-based development: the au's agenda  and convention on cyber security and personal data protection could offer such a shared vision for african countries it could help the countries collaborative platforms and networks in order to inform and grow ai-specific policies to at least  african countries over the next five years. there is also critical recognition to formulate policies and regulatory frameworks that best suit the african context, instead of the copy-and-paste of the made-in-the-north al policy frameworks that do not address africans needs and opportunities. these priorities and directions of al must be determined at national, regional, and continental levels to clear the way for innovation, restrain harm from the adoption of ai technologies and support human rights, safety , and privacy  skills and infrastructure: there is a need to create a conduit of tertiary level education programmes specialising in ai, data science, and other interdisciplinary fields. building skills and capacity for africans can enhance an inclusive ai future and strength through the community as well as formalising al training and recruitment of al talent in africa. for example, there could be the creation of  african phds in ai, data science, and other interdisciplinary fields over the next five years_ this will enable and facilitate the formation of an appropriate al infrastructure and capacity_ in addition, this could further enhance the strength and agility of educational systems in order to seize the new digital opportunities and underpin investments in learning outcomes in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data sciences in africa: moreover, there is a need to focus beyond phds, whereby african countries also target and invest in the youth at primary and secondary school levels through mentorship programmes for emerging leaders . these investments should be inclusive of women and s0 to capacitate the next generation of al practitioners. inclusion within member states must the design of responsive and equitable ai skills and capacity building roadmap in africa: furthermore , there is a call to establish ai centres of excellence in each african country by  that can assist in incubating ideas and fostering al communities of practice in an interdisciplinary and inclusive manner. applications and investments: there should be a collective investment by african member states into collaborative innovation and research prioritising solution areas for sustainable development in africa  thus, the implementation of ai applications must be addressing people 's needs o the and the potential benefits of al translated into real impact for african citizens there should be ground-up approach of collaborative ideas and practical utilisation of al that enhances access to healthcare agriculture , services, banking, and education_ this is particularly imperative for the most vulnerable populace in rural areas and help improve the movement of people, goods, and ideas within and between hastily developing megacities across africa_ this can also be enhanced by mobilising collaboration amongst a network of african companies, universities, research centres, and public institutions in order to advance the ai research   for development agenda and collective investment in collaborative innovation and research that is prioritising solution areas for sustainable development in africa. these partnerships could mean when africans design and deploy al applications, societal and human rights commitments like decent work conditions and 'equality are integrated into projects from the beginning:  gutter forge specific girls guide ground public goals gender



apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development introduction the global leadership race in ai has commenced in earnest. various nations have been releasing al strategies or declarations and making investments, to harness the power of al for their socio-economic development. currently, these are dominantly nations of north america, europe , nordic-baltic , south pacific (australia, new zealand) , arabian (uae); latin american (mexico) and russia, as well as some asian nations including china, india, singapore, south korea, taiwan, and malaysia. also included are two african countries, one sub-saharan (kenya), and one north african (tunisia) . an analysis of these strategies by tim dutton () showed some elements of uniqueness, with no two strategies being alike, and each focusing on different aspects of ai policy issues. for instance, canada '$ ai strategy is distinct other strategies because it is primarily research and talent development strategy while africa can take a cue from these ai strategy formulation initiatives, there is the imperative to approach the quest to harness al for its development, with the mind of providing african solutions to african problems _ . alandtheafrican union in a speech, by the then president kwame nkrumah, at the foundation summit of the organization of african unity (oau), in addis ababa, ethiopia, 0n the 24th of  , he is quoted to have said: ""we shall accumulate machinery and establish steelworks, iron foundries and factories; we shall link the various states of our continent with communications; we shall astound the world with our hydroelectric power; we shall drain marshes and swamps, clear infested areas, feed the undernourished, and rid our people of parasites and diseases_ it is within the possibility of science and technology to make even the sahara bloom into a vast field with verdant vegetation for agricultural and industrial developments_ decades since that speech in  ,the african union (then oau) has pursued science and technology as a development priority. in , the lagos plan of action was formulated where there was a formal expression of the awareness of the role of science, technology, and innovation (sti) in africa development_ the plan of action recommended the allocation of % gdp by africa's member states towards sti budget: at the first congress of scientists in africa o the 3oth of june , the pan-african union for science and technology (pust) was set up with its headquarters in brazzaville, congo and the 30th of june was declared each year as the sti renaissance day in africa. subsequently_ the au science , technology, and innovation strategy for africa  (stisa-) was developed in a joint collaboration between the african union commission (auc) and the then new partnership for africa'$ development (nepad), as an expression of agenda  and a new determination of the african union in . this is indicated in figure  below. the positioned science, technology, and innovation at the epicentre of africa's socio- economic development and its mission was to *accelerate africa s transition to an innovation-led,knowledge-based economy. in the exploration of technologies worth harnessing in africa, digital technologies are being touted as potential solution, in particular ai, which is the bedrock of the 4th industrial revolution (4ir). evidence abounds on the specific realisation of al application potentials for social transformation and economic development in the advanced economies, and the al role in the emerging transformative digital revolution in africa. the role f al in achieving the sdgs is well articulated in the literature (vinuesa et al, ; goralski and tan, ). in this regard, the case for ai as an essential part of africa'$ development is  from may key strategy growth .

apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development outside governmental and research bodies  this is due to the high acquisition costs for the equipment such as drones and automating field tasks. furthermore, agriculture is $ trillion industry that employs over . billion people globally. hence, there are predictions that up to millions of field workers may become unemployed in the next few decades_ .. education many of the education systems in africa do produce graduates who are ready for the job market: however, there are concerns that youth in africa are unable to join the it industry. this is because the youth lack access to the appropriate education need t advance their careers_ can only access these it skills that need only when travel to europe, china, canada, and the usa, before returning to africa and attempt new businesses in the it field. .. energy africa'$ energy systems face enormous challenges because of limited capacity in electricity generation and experience. africa offers the most acute forms of energy poverty in the world. it is estimated that over  million people across africa live without reliable access to electricity and affordable modern cooking fuels. consequently , solar energy has gained increased usage across african countries. however, most of these systems are not exploited to full life due to their poor maintenance _  global they they they they fully cycle .



apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development  the artificial intelligence technology . definition of artificial intelligence artificial intelligence (al) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. the term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solvingl . it is also known as a field of study which tries to make computers smart. these ai computers are meant to work on their own without being encoded with commands_ john mccarthy came up with the name ""artificial intelligence"" in . there are two different types of al that are known to exist_ these are specialised artificial intelligence (weak ai) and artificial general intelligence (strong al). specialised al focuses on performing one o two functions and get better at them over time on the other hand, artificial general intelligence (agi) is the hypothetical intelligence of machine that has the capacity to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can_ thus , agi is primary of some artificial intelligence research and a common topic in science fiction and future studies_ al is a discipline that is just over  years old. it has evolved in the past  years from being a mature field of research with potential for real-world impact to one whose time has come. currently, the question is not whether al technologies will have an impact, but rather which sub-areas of al will develop the next important set of ai technologies, and in which application areas will it have the most significant impact: the purpose of this section is to provide a brief overview of al as a discipline and to explore its benefits and potential pitfalls. perhaps surprisingly, there is no universally agreed-upon definition of what al is in part, this stems from out perception of intelligence in artificial contexts being situationally dependent and changing as the technology advances_ thus al is often a victim of its own success _ once ai technology traction, it ceases to be an exemplar of ai. for example, while a calculator was at some viewed as an instance of ai, this is no longer the case broadly speaking, ai can be viewed as form of data analysis in which conclusions are reached in a sophisticated way and then acted upon_ one of the more useful definitions is the one that was provided by nils nilsson, which was: *ai is that activity devoted to machines intelligent, and intelligence is that quality that enables an entity to function appropriately and with foresight in its environment however , this definition leaves a substantial scope when it comes to deciding  whether a behaviour is intelligent. furthermore, it is always beneficial to outline what al is not: thus, it is always imperative to distinguish al from cognitive science in order to show that ai does not involve the replication of human intelligence, even though, numerous ai technologies have been inspired by human intelligence _ it is also important to realise that a crucial component of many ai systems is that it may be required to provide explanations of its behaviour to humans_ ai is mature diverse   field of research, drawing from disciplines   such as big data, computer science, data science_ engineering, statistics, mathematics, applied mathematics, cognitive science, and philosophy. ai encompasses a wide range of techniques and methodologies. however our in this section is not t0 cover all of al but rather to focus on those areas that have had some recent practical real-world successes, and those that are most likely to lead to major advances in the near future_ thus it is important to note that focusing exclusively on the current trending topics is a dangerous strategy,and that ai (jake fankenfield  reviewed by gordon   skott. updated [ march  )  !wwwinvestopedia con tems wantificial-intelligence-aiasp  goal gains point making goal



apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development should be appreciated for what it is, which is a mature field of study that should be explored in a broader context. one of the main reasons for taking this view is that al techniques can be combined to achieve more complex intelligent capabilities. notably , the doomsday scenarios of al posing a grave and imminent danger to the future of humankind are fictional . however _ ai technologies are already influencing our lives and will continue to do $o in future. across the world, ai technologies are extending and   enhancing   people's  well-being in their   homes , schools, and clinics_ like most other   technologies, al technologies also have the potential to be abused. thus it is up to us as society, governments , and industry to ensure that policies are in place to ensure that al technologies are utilised in a responsible manner: in this regard, appropriate policies are needed urgently because, much as the technological singularity in al may be decades or centuries away, breakthroughs in technologies are notoriously hard to predict. unemployment and inequality are the greatest dangers posed by al roll-out globally and africa in the short-to-medium term possibly contributing to massive unemployment: the anxiety is that ai tools and ai-based artefacts may completely replace human activities in some sectors of the economy. however, this line of thinking fails to appreciate the possibility of the potential and massive benefits of ai technologies to the rest of the african population this means that al cannot be restricted t0 a select and privileged few, and thus further contributing to levels of inequality that are already unacceptably high worldwide. but it is possible to circumvent such undesirable consequences of al developments_ even though presently ai technologies seem to be replacing specific human tasks, rather than job categories if correctly dealt with, the implementation of ai technologies can lead to tremendous economic growth: in fact, al can contribute to economic throughput and ascertain that all africans can share the benefits of ai. for these positive outcomes to occur, robust and effective public policies related to al need to be adopted and enacted urgently _ . overview ofdifferenttypes ofai the different kinds of a include reactive machines, limited memory, theory of mind and self awareness. the two types are known as specialised ai (weak al) and the last two are known as artificial general intelligence (strong al). reactive machines are the most basic type of al systems_ this type is purely reactive and does not have the ability either to form new memories or  utilise past experiences in order to inform current decisions_ an example   includes an ibm s chess-playing supercomputer known as blue _ this beat the international grandmaster kasparov in the late 1990s in chess _ deep blue can identify the pieces on a chessboard and predict the next moves for itself and its opponent. moreover; it can select the most optimal realignments from among the possibilities. however, it does not have any concept of the past, nor any memory of what has already occurred_ the other kind of al is known as limited memory  this type ii class contains machines that can consider the past to learn for example, self-driving vehicles can observe other vehicles' speed and direction to determine their own_ this function cannot be done in single moment, but rather; it requires identifying specific objects and monitoring them over time_ hence these observations are added to the self-driving vehicles- pre-programmed representations of the world. this representation of the world also includes lane markings, traffic lights and other important elements, such as the curves in the road. these features and considerations are included when the vehicle decides when and how to change lanes, avoid cutting off another driver and being hit by nearby vehicle _ however, these simple pieces of information about the past are only transient: this means that are not saved as part of the vehicle's library of experience that it can learn from_ this is different from the way human drivers compile experience over years behind the wheel: the theory of mind is type iii al that is among the machines that  will be built in the future _ it falls  under the ai machines known as agis. this type of machines is more advanced. not only does it form representations about the world, but also about other agents or entities in the world. in psychology, this function is known as the ""theory of mind: the """"theory of mind""' is an understanding that people, creatures, and objects in the world can have thoughts and emotions that affect their own behaviour: without the understanding of each other's motives and intentions, and without considering what somebody else put first deep garry system from . they



apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development knows either about themselves or the environment_ working together is at best difficult, and at worst impossible. thus, if al systems are indeed ever to walk among us, will have to be able to understand that each of us has thoughts and feelings. we also have expectations on we are treated. thus, these machines will have to adjust their behaviour accordingly. self-aware machines are the final step towards ai development: these are systems that have been built such that can form representations about themselves ultimately , ai researchers will not only understand consciousness but build machines that have consciousness_ this is , in a sense, an extension of the ""theory of mind"" possessed by type iii al machines. consciousness is also called ""self-awareness"" because conscious beings are aware of themselves, know about their internal states, and can predict feelings of others_ human  beings can assume that  someone honking behind them in traffic is angry or impatient because that is how they also feel when honking at others _ therefore , without a theory of mind, humans and future machines cannot be able to make such kind of inferences even though, this kind of self-aware machines is probably far from being created al inventors and researchers should focus their efforts toward understanding memory, learning and the ability to base decisions on past experiences _ this is an important step into understanding human intelligence on its own_ this will be a crucial aspect towards designing and evolution of al machines that are more than exceptional at classifying information presented to them.  jiz  aiute   they how they

apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development .. criticisms of simulation-based approaches a fundamental criticism of the simulated brain approach derives from embodied cognition where human embodiment is taken as an essential aspect of human intelligence. numerous researchers believe that embodiment is necessary to ground meaning: if this view is correct, any fully functional brain model will need to encompass more than just the neurons; i.e. robotic body _ goertzel proposed virtual embodiment, such as the second life, but it is not yet known  whether this would be sufficient: moreover, it is known that desktop computers using microprocessors capable of more than  cps have been available since . according to the brainpower estimates used by kurzweil and moravec, this computer should be capable of supporting a simulation of a bee brain_ however, despite some interest, no such simulation exists_ the reasons for this phenomenon include the fact that the neuron model  seemed  oversimplified. furthermore, there is insufficient understanding of higher cognitive processes to accurately establish what the brain's neural  activity, observed techniques   such as   functional magnetic resonance imaging, correlates with. additionally, even if our understanding of cognition advances sufficiently , early simulation  programmes are likely to be extremely inefficient and will. therefore, this needs considerably more hardware lastly , the brain of an organism, while critical, may not be an appropriate boundary for cognitive model: to simulate a bee brain, it may be necessary to simulate the body and the environment_ the extended mind thesis formalised the philosophical concept, and research into cephalopods has demonstrated clear examples of a decentralised system_ in addition, the scale of the human brain is not currently well-constrained. one researcher estimated that the human brain is about  billion neurons and  trillion synapses. other researchers also estimated that the human brain is  billion neurons, of which . billion consists of the cerebral cortex and  billion is the cerebellum_ glial cell synapses are currently unquantified but are known to be extremely numerous_ .. strong al and consciousness in , a philosopher known as john searle coined the term strong ai as part of his chinese room argument: he wanted to distinguish between two different hypotheses about artificial intelligence _ the first hypothesis was that an artificial intelligence system can think and have a mind. the other hypothesis was that an artificial intelligence system can only act like it thinks and has a mind. the first one is called ~the strong ai hypothesis"" and the second is ""the weak ai hypothesis. this is because the first one makes the stronger statement since it assumes something has happened to the machine that goes beyond all its abilities that we can test. searle referred to the ""strong ai hypothesis"" as ""strong ai: this usage is also common in academic ai research and textbooks_ on the other hand, the weak ai hypothesis is equivalent to the hypothesis that artificial general intelligence is possible. according to russell and norvig, ""most al researchers take the weak ai hypothesis for granted, and do not care about the strong ai hypothesis: in contrast to searle, ray kurzweil uses the term strong at"" to describe any ai that acts like it has mind, regardless of whether a philosopher would be able to determine if it actually has mind or not: in science fiction, agi is associated with traits such as consciousness, sentience, sapience, and self-awareness observed in however, according to searle, it is an  open question of whether intelligence is   sufficient   for consciousness. ""strong ai; as defined above by kurzweil, should not be confused with searle's ""strong ai hypothesis. the strong ai hypothesis is the claim that a computer which behaves as intelligently as a human being must also necessarily have a mind and consciousness. however, agi refers only to the amount of intelligence that the machine displays, with or without a mind. .. controversies and dangers of agi ... feasibility as of march  , agi remains speculative   technology as   such_ there are no agi systems   that have demonstrated functionality. presently , opinions vary 0n whether and when artificial general intelligence will arrive, and if it may arrive at all. at one extreme, al pioneer herbet a. simon speculated in  that machines will be capable, within  years of doing any work a man can do. however, this prediction failed to come true. on the other hand, microsoft co-founder paul allen believed that using special system living beings _ general



apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development  such intelligence is unlikely in the 2lst century because it would require unforeseeable and fundamentally unpredictable breakthroughs and a scientifically understanding of cognition. writing in the guardian, roboticist alan winfield claimed the gulf between modern computing and human-level ai is as  wide as the between current space flight and practical faster-than-light   spaceflight: additionally , al experts views on the feasibility of agi wax and wane and may have seen resurgence in the 2010s. four conducted in  and  suggested that the median guess among experts for when would be % confident agi would arrive was between  and , with the mean being . of the experts , . answered  with ` never when asked the same question. however, % of the experts had confidence in the success of the technology in future boucher, ). ... potential threat to human existence the thesis that al poses an existential risk, and that this risk needs much more attention than it currently has been endorsed by many public figures. perhaps the most famous are elon musk, bill gates, and  stephen hawking: the most notable ai researcher to endorse the thesis is  stuart j_ russel_ endorsers of the thesis sometimes express bafflement at sceptics_ for example, bill gates stated that he does not understand why some people are not concerned about agis potential threats to humanity. stephen hawking criticised widespread indifference in his  editorial and said: possible futures of incalculable benefits and risks, the experts are surely doing everything possible to ensure the best outcome, right? wrong: if a superior alien civilisation sent us a message saying, we 'il arrive in a few decades, would we just reply, `ok, call us when yu get here we 'il leave the lights on?' probably not but this is more or less what is happening with numerous scholars who are concerned about existential risk believe that the best way forward would be to conduct extensive research into the   difficult  control problem_ this will therefore answer the question of what types of safeguards_ algorithms, and architectures can programmers be able to implement in order to maximise the probability that their recursively improving al would continue to behave in friendly, rather than destructive, manner after it reaches superintelligence. on the other hand_ the thesis that al can pose existential risk also has countless strong detractors. sceptics sometimes charge that the thesis is crypto-religious, with an  irrational belief in the possibility of superintelligence replacing an irrational belief in an omnipotent god. at an extreme, jaron lanier argued that the whole concept that current machines are in any way intelligent is an illusion and a stupendous con by the wealthy (hamblin, ). however, much of the existing criticism argues that agi is unlikely to be realised in the short term. computer scientist such as gordon bell argued that the human race will already destroy itself before it reaches the technological singularity . gordon moore, the original proponent of the moore's law, declared that: tam sceptic . [do not believe that a technological singularity is likely to happen, at least for a time_ and [ do not know why [ feel that  way. andrew ng; the vice president of baidu  stated that al existential risk is  like  worrying  about overpopulation on mars when we have not even set foot on the planet as yet  .   specialised artificial intelligence (weak ai) the transport sector is one of the major beneficiaries of the weak ai where significant contribution has been made. as with other application areas of ai, the primary reason for the existing widespread adoption of al in transportation is the scale and diversity of individual and population-level transportation data_ therefore , this has made possible innovation on variety of ai applications   related to transport, such as  real-time prediction and route navigation_ for example, gps devices were   first introduced into vehicles in the early 2000s and are fast becoming fundamental part of transportation infrastructure. the same goes for other devices with sensing  capabilities   such as   accelerometers and moisture sensors _ moreover, autonomous transportation, whether it be in the form of autonomous public transport, self-driving cars, o self-driving trucks, is likely to become the norm in the near future_  deep gulf polls they gets_ ~so, facing solving long



apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development business process automation smart devices and robotics is another application area with great potential in al. while automation in various forms has been used in numerous industries for years it is only in the past + years that physical robots and smart appliances have started to enter people's homes and businesses_ this is due, in part, to positive feedback where ai advances are inspired by  mechanical  innovations which_ in turn, prompt new ai techniques to be introduced furthermore , advances in hardware are making it possible to embed high-performing specialised processors into low-cost devices. therefore, this means that it will soon be possible to support more sophisticated al in smart devices than was previously possible. for example, in recent years low cost, safe, robot arms have been introduced to hundreds of research laboratories around the world. healthcare is another application area worth considering: as with most of the other application areas that were considered, progress in machine learning, coupled with the possibility of large-scale data collection, is making it possible to diagnostically infer possible health risks automatically. this could potentially provide for an experience where the human dimension of care is augmented with automated reasoning  processes. this phenomenon is  already happening to some extent  and will continue to improve in future. additionally, driven by the mobile computing revolution it has become possible to combine social and healthcare data. thereby, opening possibilities for prediction, both 0n the personal and population level that would otherwise be simply impossible. as in other application areas, the main obstacles for ai technologies to reach their true potential in the area of healthcare are not technological, but rather psychological, sociological, ethical, and legal. these relate not oly to the efficacy and accuracy of these methods but, especially in the health domain, to security and privacy concerns. it is crucial that al systems the trust of both healthcare professionals and ordinary people. in this context, improvements in methods for interacting with medical professionals and patients will be a critical challenge. the final application area for consideration for weak al is public safety and security _ as it is amongst the most controversial ai application component. like the others, it is an area in which al tools have already been deployed successfully. in this area, perhaps more than in  others, it is imperative to public trust: this  is because there are legitimate  concerns that the incorporation of ai into the maintenance of public safety and security could become too pervasive and invasive. at the same time, it is worth noting that alcould also contribute to reducing the overbearing policing methods by ensuring that such methods are targeted appropriately and used only when needed. for example, machine learning can significantly enhance the ability to predict where and when crimes are most likely to occur and who may be responsible for committing them _ such predictive policing tools could raise the spectre of innocent people unjustifiably targeted. thus, well-deployed al prediction tools have the potential to remove or reduce human bias_ rather than reinforcing it. therefore , it is imperative that research and resources be directed toward ensuring this effect: similarly , tools already exist that are used for scanning various social media forums to look for certain types of events and how may impact security. for example, ai can help in social network analysis to prevent those at risk from being radicalised by violent groups. hence, law enforcement agencies are increasingly interested in trying to detect plans for disruptive events from social media as well as monitor activities at gatherings of people in order to analyse security. but the very success of such methods has led to legitimate concerns about the potential for law enforcement agencies to overreach and use such tools to violate people'$ privacy. .  addressing the myths and misconceptions about al technology ai has sparked excitement and robust discussions among stis across various platforms. notably, there have been discussions about the unprecedented potential of al to possibly revolutionise all aspects of peoples lives. however, as with anything new there are certainly and fake news surrounding the adoption of al in our every day's lives_ this has raised tremendous concerns among the public that has led to fear and distrust: thus, this section intends to address some of the basic misconceptions and frequently peddled mistruths .  using large loop gain gain being being they large myths



apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development the first about al is that ai will completely replace all jobs. certainly, it has been predicted that the advent of al and automation will potentially disrupt the labour force. in some situations, it is already disrupting numerous industries across the globe_ however, it is  misleading   and an over-simplification to consider this transition as straightforward transfer of labour from humans to machines. based on historical observations, previous industrial revolutions have undeniably resulted in the transformation of the employment landscape. for example, the 19th century, there was a mass shift from agricultural work to factories among numerous economies across the world_ in the zoth century , the introduction of computers and the internet led to a robust increase in jobs. the number of jobs created because of these transformations was adjusted for the rapid in population that had principally remained consistent: moreover, despite what doom-mongers have proclaimed with regards to job losses, there has been very limited actual evidence that suggests the likelihood of massive unemployment due to widespread  redundancy of human  workforces. in contrast, there have been  strong  forecasts of possible better productive economic activities that will be   afforded by the increased efficiency and reduction of waste that   automation   promises_ consequently, this will provide the workforce with more options for better spending their time 0n productive and income- generating pursuits_ in the short-term, employers are generally looking at al technology as a method of augmenting human workforces and enabling them to work in newer and smarter ways_ the second myth is that only low-skilled and manual workers will be replaced by al and automation this is misconception because ai-based robots and machinery are generally reserved for sophisticated tasks in manufacturing, mining, healthcare _ banking, and public services. this is aimed at reducing the drudgery of the day-to-day aspects of the work. for example, in the legal field, ai can be utilised in hastily analysing numeral documents so to extract relevant information for ongoing cases. in healthcare , machine learning algorithms can analyse and evaluate scans of x-rays for diagnostic purposes on early warning signs of diseases as are proving to be highly competent at detection. however most of these ai technologies and machines will require the intervention of the human touch procedures in their operations. for example, a lawyer would still have to present arguments in court in front of a judge. in medicine, the healthcare practitioners will still need to consult with their patients about the diagnosis and discuss the future care protocols in the most considerate and helpful way _ these aspects of the jobs are less likely to be automated, but members of their respective professions could find that have more time for their jobs. this is because the mundane drudgery is routinely automated and tedious aspects of their jobs had been eliminated. therefore , the practitioners may become more competent at their jobs. there is another perception that super-intelligent computers will develop to level where become superior to humans at performing tasks_ broadly   speaking, there two groups of ai applications known as specialised and   generalised ai. specialised al involves technologies that are focused on performing one job, or working in one field, and becoming increasingly at it. the legal and medical applications are typical examples of such technology. on the other hand, generalised al are technologies that are capable of applying themselves to several different tasks, just as human or  natural intelligence can_ however, this kind of advancement is still somewhat further to being realised. thus, it is more likely that it will take some time before this kind of generalised al-inspired robots come face-to-face with humans. this implies that it will take some time before artificial intelligence quickly overtakes and outpace human intelligence _ this misconception is brought about by imagining that intelligence is manifested in a linear scale. this is perpetuated by the fact that humans always imagine that perhaps animal 's score at the lower end of the scale, humans are at the higher end, and with super-smart machines at the top of the scale. however, in reality, intelligence is appraised in several dimensions for example, when  regarding the of calculations and capacity for recall, computers can far outpace humans. but the super-smart machines do not possess the creative ability emotional intelligence  such as empathy and strategic thinking, which are qualities that only humans can offer, at least in the foreseeable future.  myth during  growth they they they good off speed



apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development . recent advances in al an analysis of the history of computing technologies shows that technological changes are usually exponential. this is in line with kurzweil's ~law of accelerating returns"" (kurzweil, ). this means that, as time passes, technology changes faster _ this phenomenon has also been observable in the advances in al technologies. therefore, this demands that both the current technology landscape, as well as its ebbs and flows, be clearly understood. consequently _ africa '$ ability to realise the future of the ai technologies will depend on her own developmental goals' context that requires mastery of the change. ai technologies are causing changes to the technology landscape by creating new segments such as self-driving cars, destroying existing segments such as gps trackers, and transforming other technological segments such as automobiles_ thus, for africa to greatly harness ai for its   socio-economics' progress, the prerequisite is to classify, exploit, and outline   emerging ai technologies according to africa's framework. therefore, african needs to either embrace or overlook some aspect of al as the deviations in the landscape   continue to unfold_ in this way , africa must invest, utilise, and  influence the ai technology implementation for cost-effectiveness, framework assessment, thus africa 's socio-economic development: overwhelming evidence is showing that al is disruptive and  transformative set of technologies, and africa is on the cusp of such an al revolution _ ai as a discipline of just over  years old, during the first  years of its development, some of the important ai successes were  limited to research laboratories. however; during the last  years, the substantial changes and developments of sophisticated intelligent systems were adopted by governments and numerous  industries, worldwide_ the factors that have significantly contributed to this dramatic shift included the developments in the fields of computer vision natural  language processing (nlp) and knowledge representation and reasoning (kr) nlp is mixture of artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. this means nlp is the machine's ability to process information (what is said) , structure the information received, determine the necessary response,and respond in a language that humans can understand. the most popular applications of nlp include machine translation , speech recognition , sentiment analysis, question, answering (concerned with building systems that automatically answer questions posed by humans in a natural language) , automatic summarisation, and chatbots (several  channels, including the internet, applications, and messaging platforms) _ another application of nlp is market intelligence, where marketers use nlp to search for people with likely or explicit intention of making a purchase. in this case, people's behaviour on the internet, maintaining pages on social networks and queries to search engines provide a lot of useful unstructured customer data. selling the right advertisement for internet users allows google and facebook to make the most of its revenue. in this case, advertisers pay google every time visitor clicks on an advertisement_ a click can cost anywhere between few cents and more than $. moreover; nlp can be used in text classification text classification is the task of assigning a set of predefined categories to free text text classifiers can be used to organise, structure, and categorise almost anything machine learning, as sub-area of has enhanced learning and predictive algorithms as well as the progress in relevant hardware technology. consequently, this has led to the availability of unbelievably hefty amounts of data that were mostly harvested from huge online repository companies such as google, facebook, and amazon_ notably , the advances in machine learning have significantly benefitted other sub-areas of al such as computer vision, speech recognition, affective computing, and natural language processing. these benefits have also cascaded to automated decision making: machine learning focuses on using statistical techniques to build intelligent computer systems in order to learn from databases available to it. currently, machine learning has been used in multiple fields and industries such as medical diagnosis, image processing, prediction, classification_ learning association, regression_ another example of machine learning is speech recognition. speech recognition is the translation of spoken words the text known as computer speech recognition or automatic speech recognition. here, a software application can recognise the words spoken in an audio clip or and then subsequently convert the audio into a text file. the measurement in this application can be a set of numbers that represent the speech signal. the speech signal can be segmented by intensities in different  ray being al, into file,

apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development  al applications and opportunities . current and possible future applications of al the applications  for artificial  intelligence are endless_ the technology can be applied to numerous  sectors and industries_ al-enabled systems as at now are adapted and incorporated into different applications across healthcare, agriculture mining, industry, and government public service enterprises, as more sophisticated (abney, ). al is tested and used in the healthcare industry for drugs and different treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures in the operating room. worth is that al is still  growing traction as maturing technology, and current al systems   still possess basic capacity to recognise the human expression, tone, emotion, and subtleties of human interaction. progress has been made attempting to teach computers to accomplish limited actions such as playing a game, recognising an image, and predicting traffic flowlcongestions_ more innovative work remains to be developed before ai-based technologies that can perform human tasks are realised. however, it is encouraging that africa and the rest of the globe are currently undergoing an unparalleled period of technological innovation. perhaps, the most important factor relates to the recent advances made in the sub-area of ai known as machine learning: these advances have been realised by developments in learning and predictive algorithms (such as regression and trend analysis   based on statistics_ and artificial neural  networks, which are computational  models and can mimic the human brain) , progress in hardware technology_ and the availability of incredibly large amounts of data, primarily collected on large online repositories by companies such as google, facebook, and amazon _ the advances in machine learning have had hugely beneficial effects on other sub-areas of ai, most particularly computer vision , speech recognition and natural language processing it has also had beneficial effect on automated decision making_ recent advances in automated decision making can largely be attributed to developments in the area of machine learning in order to deal with matters of representation and scalability  a typical example of such a phenomenon is robotics, where navigation in static familiar environments is essentially solved problem. but current research is   largely  focused on the  development  of ways   and methods   that can enable   robotics operations  in unfamiliar environments. this is where machine learning plays a crucial part. .  opportunities although the focus in ai is on the automation of intelligent behaviour, there is a clear recognition that intelligence frequently involves the cooperation of some kind between stakeholders_ this cooperation can be forged with human and/or other intelligent systems. presently, there is strong interest in the development of such collaborative systems_ the focus is primarily on the development of formal models of collaboration and capabilities needed by collaborative systems to become effective partners_ the advantage of,and indeed the necessity for, instilling collaborative capabilities into al systems should be obvious_ typical example of such an advantage is in the application domain of self-driving vehicles. for instance, such companies include google and tesla that have already demonstrated the feasibility of this technology with respect to driverless motor vehicles. nonetheless, for these systems to be scalable to sophisticated level of collaboration within, as well as between, self- driving vehicles and humans will prove to be crucial. in a similar vein, the area of crowdsourcing and human computation is premised on the assumption that human abilities in some areas will, for the foreseeable future, be superior to that of automated methods _ additionally , crowdsourcing and human computation are premised 0n the fact that the greatest solutions will be obtained by harnessing combination of the abilities of human and ai machines _ the best example of such system is known as wikipedia. wikipedia is knowledge repository that far exceeds more traditional information sources in terms of both scale and depth.  being being they get dosing _ noting quite beings beings

apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development . some guidelines for harnessing al for africa's development driven by the foregoing principles set out in the previous sections, the following guidelines should be considered. .. ait needs assessment framework an analysis of the history of computing technologies shows that technological change is exponential , and this is in line with ray kurzweil's ""law of accelerating returns"" (kurzweil, ) . that is, as time passes technology changes faster: this phenomenon is observed  in the advances in ai technologies. therefore_ this   demands that   both the current technology landscape , as well as its ebbs and flows, should be clearly understood. hence, africa's ability to own the future of the ai technologies in its own developmental s context requires mastery of the change. this is because, al technologies are causing changes to the technology landscape, creating new segments, such as self-driving cars, destroying existing segments such as gps trackers, and transforming some segments, such as automobiles. thus, for africa to maximally harness al for its developments, there is the need for capacity to identify, utilise, and the emerging ai technologies in africa'$ context_ consequently , decisions to either embrace o ignore what aspect of ai must be made, as the changes in the landscape continue to unfold this means africa must embrace aist through investing, utilising and contextually shaping the al technology to the continent' s challenges. either choice, if picked wrong, can be costly. so, the development of a framework for assessing ait needs for africa'$ development is imperative_ aietac c hagt t ~eeattormi # aualitaje fanen t une figure : ai etac (emerging technology analysis canvas) framework (perera , )  goal- shape t jjua""



apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development figure  above shows perera' s ai etac (emerging technology analysis canvas) framework that provides guide for ai technology needs assessment framework (perera, ). by using this ai etac framework as a guide, africa should be able to; a) make it easier to decide  what aspects of al to include and which ones to exclude; b) provide a shared understanding that enables an easier discussion towards an intelligent ait analysis among stakeholders, communicate and educate others and learn from others , about the ai technology; c) facilitate appropriate contextualisation of the ait development and adoption_ reflecting the realities of the african development aspirations; d) provide mechanisms for engaging in the long-term adaptation of the technology, as well as the study of ait effects, and; e) be amenable to adaptive evolution. further by perera s ai etac, the proposed ai technology needs assessment framework for africa, should be subject to several conditions, which include trigger, impact, feasibility, and risks conditions_ these can be arranged around logical narrative that probes the al technology in the african context. trigger condition deals with the identification of developmental needs and related ai innovations that address those needs, albeit, bearing in mind that often, the innovation could change the initial perception of the problem. impact condition is that ai technology should have significant potential impact: feasibility condition is that the feasibility of the al technology, vis-a-vis the available resources, should not be in doubt. risks condition is that al technology must navigate risks related to technology development and adoption  ..  supportive infrastructure deliberate investment in connectivity infrastructure is sine qua non to productive ai for africa' s development: the availability of robust; ubiquitous, and affordable communication and power supply infrastructure is imperative. without this_ ai s potential benefits will be limited to and enjoyed only few privileged elites. this is further elucidated to, later in this report_ .. regulatory and policy framework it is critical to have policies and regulatory frameworks in place that promotes productive ai harnessing, by encouraging innovation and investment. au should encourage african   governments to take deliberate and  proactive   approach, to implement supportive regulation , policies, and initiatives_ there are several areas relevant to the development of al-enabled robust digital economies, where policymakers should focus. this is elaborated upon in later part of this report_ .. creating a collaborative environment taking a cue from leading countries in ai, african governments should create enabling environments for increasing cooperation and exchange of information between quadruple helix stakeholders. this should allow for the different stakeholders to work together, rather than in silos. such collaborative approach could facilitate the sharing of expertise and perspectives o al. african governments can acquire a deeper understanding of the al technology, by drawing 0n international but contextualised best practices, to address specific local and regional african needs. this approach could ensure that policy and regulatory action protects citizens while supporting ai technology development. furthermore, multi-sectoral collaboration is essential for the safe, ethical and beneficial development and use of al technologies. africa should not be left behind in active participation, positing african  perspective, in the   itu-facilitated ai-for-good global summit   series, which   brings   together   relevant stakeholders, to explore responsible development of human-centric ai. this can be carried out so to solve african challenges and accelerate au's development aspirations. specific recommendations 0n this are provided in the latter part of this booklet.  guided by grand



apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development . conclusion as africa aspires to develop through a framework provided by the au's agenda  for the next half a century period, african governments should focus development on a broad front such as economic, social, political, scientific, and cultural advancement. this can be achieved in alignment with the stisa- programme derived from agenda , which places science technology, and innovation at the epicentre of africa's socio-economic development and growth. african countries should set national al-driven priority areas towards eradicating hunger, ensuring nutrition and food security , preventing, and controlling diseases and ensuring the wellbeing of its citizens. special emphasis should be placed on communicating their physical and intellectual mobility and translate it into developmental strategies. furthermore , there is a call to utilise and channel africa' $ natural resources into al's manufacturing, which could make ai technology much cheaper: this can in-turn improve africa $ sti readiness with respect to infrastructure, professional and technical competence, and entrepreneurial capacity. such an approach can also promote the implementation of specific policies and programmes in science, technology and innovation that address societal needs in a holistic and sustainable way. moreover africa collective efforts cannot afford to continue with the habit of seeking for already-made solutions, from some other contexts attempting to counter african problems as a matter of course. notably, african challenges must be addressed by african solutions, specifically designed towards an african context thus, africa must strategically utilise contextualised ideas such that significantly consider the realities of the african socio- cultural and economic contexts _ policy regulatory and strategic considerations about africa should be designed with regard to al. thus_ it is essential to situate ai in regional, continental, and   global   frameworks_ this section   begins by exploring   regional and   continental frameworks that are of particular interest to al and then focuses on the global context. possible gaps in the and continental frameworks are highlighted. the view that frameworks influence strategy, strategy informs policy and policy drives regulation, the section starts by looking at regional and continental frameworks furthermore, this section then elaborates on key policy issues that arise from the introduction of al and what policymakers should thus pay attention to. examples of policies are provided, and the section ends with checklist of policy options as reference. moreover, legal and regulatory aspects related to a are also presented in the context of the application areasluse cases identified. while this approach makes it easier to contextualise , general and common legal and regulatory issues are presented as a preamble to the more specific discussion. the section ends with a checklist of key legal and regulatory issues pertaining to ai.  they regional taking key

apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development in developing their strategies, african countries will need to think about pre-conditions for successful ai implementation and these include: physical infrastructure; regulatory and policy framework; national and regional research systems; social responsibility; education systems and standards; and intellectual property regimes _ as african countries move towards the development f strategies dealing with ai, the importance of and international cooperation cannot be overemphasised. through the african union and its   regional economic communities, africa' s development has to a large extent follow the principles of regional integration _ this is important for ai in that it would enable countries to resources, develop common frameworks and standards and share access to data. as countries progress in al implementation at different levels, the role of auda-nepad agency will be to monitor the developments and ensure that all member states are moving towards a common in the al sector. furthermore , global cooperation will also be needed to ensure that africa' $ policies and strategies are aligned with the rest of the world_ the case of government agility in providing an enabling environment is exemplified by the government of rwanda which amended its civil aviation regulations to permit a drone delivery service. this drone service delivery allows for the supply of medication and blood to remote areas of the country _ that is why every region across the world is looking at leveraging their unique abilities towards leading in ai-inspired technologies. for example, china is on its population size and size of data it collects. it then operates as and unified central government and allocate its large amounts of funds towards ai. the usa is leveraging the number of talents and tech companies it has_ the question then becomes: what could be africa's unique leverage? the answer is the  growing population of young people africa has _ it has   been  reported that % of africa $ population   is below the age of , making it the youngest continent in the world according to the united nations world population prospects ( revision). africa is further projected to grow by  by  according to the united nations department of economic and social affairs (population division, may ). so, the biggest potential al strategy for africa could be that by ,  million young africans could be skilled in ai, data science, and other industry . technologies  then these young africans can then meet the globally growing demand for al skills. . guiding principles .. principle of sandt development and transfer some principles of sandt development and transfer are of relevance, in the quest to harness al for africa' s socio-economic advancement_ these principles have indicated that al science and technology (aist) is; (a_ universal and particular , (b) problem- solving, and (c) interactive. the universality and particularity of aist are that the conceptual knowledge of al remains the identical world-wide, and the contextual knowledge of the al is applicable in each domain of socio-cultural and economic context, respectively_ both conceptual and contextual knowledge is required for appropriate ai solution provisioning, in any given context: this implies that any transfer of ait must be accompanied by the transfer of its science. notably aist is problem-solving in that any problem to which an al solution applies, and therefore must be contextually defined . hence by implication, an ai solution provided in one context cannot be directly extrapolated into another context, without adaptation_ otherwise, model mismatching may result in obvious complications. since aist is interactive, it allows for ait to engage in real-time problem-solving in an ai application context and afford the validation of its strength and limitations to be assessed. such contextual limitations could then be appropriately managed and re-examined for underpinning science that can be utilised for corrections and further development:  regional pool goal betting top



apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development .. principle of african solutions to african problems africa's collective efforts cannot afford to continue with the habit of seeking for already-made solutions, from some other contexts attempting to counter african problems as a matter of course_ it should be noted that african problems are african context defined, and so , should be the approach to ai solution provisioning, which  should be african home-grown. the principles sandt development and transfer are espoused in sub-section ... have a bearing 0n this. in this regard, the following statement in the european commission $ (ec) declaration on cooperation on ai;"" is instructive (belgie, ). the statement made was: ensuring an adequate legal and ethical framework; building on european union (eu) fundamental rights and values including privacy and protection of personal data, as well as principles such as transparency and accountability. this statement implied that the ec wants to harness the power of ai, by adopting euro-centric approach and providing a european solution to european problem. taking a cue from this ec approach, as much as africa can borrow ideas from the range of issues considered in the strategies of other nations, the usage of the ideas has to be contextualised in such a way that significantly considers the realities of the african socio-cultural and economic contexts. .. principle of diversity-aware diversity is an intrinsic of africa. as conceptualised for the context of al for africa'$ development; diversity-aware principle posits that african diversity should be positively managed, maintained and exploited, rather than treated as an aberration to be ignored. thus, this warrants attainment of through diversity management. the principle is reverse-globalisation approach , whereby one-size-fits-all thinking is discouraged, and the strategy evolution is bottom-up rather than top-down thus . adopting a federated strategy for harnessing al for africa '$ development is highly advocated for_ a federated strategy abstracts the aspect that is universal africa-wide_ to the au level, while aspects specific to each of the national constituents are handled at the national levels_ the diversity-aware principle will facilitate teaming up of african nations so that the opportunities of ai for africa's socio-cultural and economic development can be maximally exploited, while the challenges can be dealt with collectively_ ..  principle of social management of ai the principle of social management of al recognises a key element of the african heritage, which is a social world view, based on human it posits that ait is more than just the hardware and software artefacts_ but rather a social process. this means that it focuses on human needs and wants, which are the ends this principle acknowledges that ait, like any other technology_ has side effects, which could be social, cultural, economic, and political effects it further acknowledges that ait is not value- free, as it seems naive to separate the existence of alts from the uses to which are put nor the values of their creators most importantly, this principle acknowledges that ait is not  inherently or bad, rather it is humanity' $ use of that technology that could render it evil or virtuous. therefore, the principle advocates for harnessing al for africa's development, in socially responsible manner_ this is carried out by enacting deliberate strategy for managing the ait risks, creators (individual and institutional) , and the future of the technology against the environment and humanity. in such strategy, an appropriate balance must be struck between maximising the exploitation of its beneficial opportunities and minimising the risks. . principles of ai for good of all the au's development aspirations set in agenda  is to ""build an africa whose development is people-driven, relying on the   potential offered by   people, more especially its women and   youth and   caring for children""_ the international telecommunication union  (itu), in collaboration with other organisations, has been  championing for series of global summits on al for good. going these , al for good of all should be set as principle, in harnessing ai for africa' $ development. the ai harnessing should be implemented such that it is human-centred and placing this principle at the heart of  heritage ' being unity beings . they from good by

apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development african countries will need to examine how al is placed in relation to existing laws and what changes will need to be enacted as the technology is adopted and adapted. this will have to take cognisance of global laws such as the european union general data protection regulation (eu gdpr which as previously mentioned is concerned with data privacy. therefore , in regulating ai, african countries will need to focus on several dimensions including the regulation of ai itself, the regulation of specific industries that use al such as self-driving vehicles_ and self-regulation through standards and codes of practice. while formal al regulatory systems are developed, africa should consider soft regulation in the form of guidelines and principles. the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) has recently released the following principles with five points emphasising that: ai should benefit people; al systems should respect rule of law, human rights, and democratic values; there should be transparency and disclosure; al systems should be robust, secure, and safe; and developers and implementers of al systems should be held accountable in upholding these principles. the oecd principles have been signed by the  oecd members and  south american countries. the future of life institute has  al principles categorised under  broad headings: research, ethics and values, long-term issues signatories to these principles are mainly individuals, academics, and industry/technology companies _ while not away from these global initiatives africa should consider framing its own guidelines and principles and this will require leadership from member states. apart from determining the laws and regulations that are needed, african countries will need to look at the institutional architecture that will support enforcement and compliance and determine what implications this has on resources and capacity the lack of capacity, skills and expertise is one possible reason for the lack of policies and accompanying legal and regulatory frameworks that should be instated in order to deal with ai: . the alpolicy space policy interventions are required in africa that will accelerate the uptake of al in a way that serves africa '$ socio-economic developmental needs. in developing al policies, african governments should consider the overarching intent and priorities for their countries. this must include growth of their economy, capacity and skills development, industrialisation, diversification of the labour market. to systematically achieve this, al policies can be categorised as direct, indirect, o af- relevant _ direct al policies are those policies aimed specifically at al technologies. indirect policies are those that affect ai without focusing directly on the technology. an example of indirect policy would be intellectual property policies and laws_ ai- relevant policies are those policies that are affecting associated sectors linked to o affected by ai: this is where africa might need to spend more effort as countries focus on the  impact of ai on education, health, agriculture_ finance, mining, industrialisation , others _ while learning from what other countries and regions are africa will also need to contextualise al policy frameworks so that al development and associated resources are channeled to the right priorities. in the same way that discussions  ai are focusing on how al can support the sdgs, africa should consider how it can support attainment of the of agenda . the following are proposed recommendations on the al policy space for africa:  million young africans should be skilled in ai, data science,and other industry . technologies. these young africans can then meet the globally growing demand for ai skills; governments   should partner, fund and scale existing ai capacity-building efforts across the continent: this includes initiatives from organisations including runmila al institute, data science nigeria, learning indaba, zindi africa and ai expo africa;  being = taking among doing, goals deep

apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development in developing al policies, african governments should consider the overarching intent and priorities for their countries. this must include growth of their economy, capacity and skills development, industrialisation , diversification of the labour market: this is where africa might need to spend more effort as countries focus  the impact of ai on education, health, agriculture finance, mining, industrialisation, among others_ admittedly , there are risks and challenges that are associated with al implementation in socio-economic growth, however, this reality should not obstruct the fact that there are several opportunities for economic growth. thus, because of the opportunities associated with ai, several ai-based public and private institutions have employed dedicated al-based applications' developers_ examples include ai-based marketing  techniques that aimed at maximising marketing for small business and focusing o achieving high marketing strategies_ this has led to increased interest and investment by numerous businesses trying t0 take opportunities in ai-based marketing activities that can potentially deliver the highest return 0n investment: a-based marketing solutions have created ai-enabled platforms such as acquisio that can easily be used to manage marketing operations across various channels such as google adwords, facebook, and bing. this machine learning-enabled layer analyses the live campaign data with the help of sentiment analysis algorithms. consequently , recommends the best distribution of marketing activities that will eventually yield to the greatest outcomes _ this is because it automates bids and monitors overall marketing so that business owners can reduce the time spent on tracking marketing campaigns and pay attention to other important areas. another advantage of using ai base solutions is the ability for businesses to track competitors and review the competition on their busy schedules. for example, there are   various competitive analysis tools such as crayon that can be used to track competitors with the help of different media channels such as websites and social media_ these   platforms   present the opportunities business owners with competitive advantage of studying any changes in their competitors marketing planning such as changes , subtle message modifications and public relation activities. in addition, small business owners may take the advantage of amount of online and offline information to make  informed and data-driven decisions that  can potentially grow their businesses_ what is interesting about al-powered tools for businesses is that can be tailored into every data producing workflow, leading to the production of useful insights that are quite applicable and actionable. ai business tools such as ~monkey learn integrate and analyse data across various media channels, which then achieves timesaving analytics and create reports such as sentiment analysis in google sheets and csv. al integrated customer support solutions such as automated chat systems permit small businesses to scale their customer service efforts and free up resources needed for more difficult customer interactions. examples include al customer services solutions such as digital genius and chatty people that can suggest or automate answers to incoming customer questions, classify help tickets and direct inquiries or messages to the appropriate department. consequently , by this ai-inspired customer support, there is an enormous reduction in average handling time observed and an enhancement in the overall responsiveness of the customer  service team_ lastly, ai has also  improved customer relationship  management (crm) in small-and-medium businesses through the valuable insights that help with managing interactions of present and prospective clients. these crm platforms are embedded ai functionality that can ensure real-time data analysis to provide   predictions and recommendations based on businesses' unique processes and customer data  regular spend price large they using with



apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development challenges and forthcoming solutions . al implementation challenges for socio-economic development and growth the first challenge that african countries will need to overcome is the fact that computing is not that advanced. this is because machine learning and deep learning techniques that are the most beneficial for the advancement of ai require a series of calculations to be done rapidly , and this can be in microseconds or nanoseconds_ this, therefore, implies that that ai technologies utilise humongous processing power. the biggest debate amongst al experts and policymakers has always been that there is insufficient  processing power that is  needed to capacitate and  implement ai technologies. however, cloud computing and massively parallel  processing have created for the implementation of al in the short term_ nonetheless, as data volumes continue to increase, and learning advances towards automated creation of increasingly complex algorithms, cloud computing may become limited_ creating trust in al technologies because of security and privacy issues is another challenge for al implementation_ this is because numerous people perceive al as a black box and difficult to understand. consequently , people remain uncomfortable with ai adoption into the businesses and service providing outlets_ for example, financial institutions such as banks to utilise simple and linear mathematical algorithms that are easy to explain their input to output. since ai applications need much more   complex mathematical algorithms numerous businesses avoid implementing them_ thus, since trust remains limited among people, it has been  challenging to enable people grasp that this technology really works   and possesses  numerous opportunities  for better  accurate predictions  furthermore , numerous   peoplelbusinesses are concerned because of possible elevated complications due to governments overstep into their privacy. hence, the enaction of legal and ethical regulations that can allow citizens to possess the right for explanations for governments' prying into their privacy and enable their contributions to the decisions that are made about them as a consequence of ai: another challenge that needs to be addressed is that most al applications and deployments are vastly specialised . the specialised al is known as applied ai: applied al is built such that it can perform tasks while learning in order to improve and become better at those tasks_ in contrast, generalised al is different such that it performs any task just as human beings. but all of these al technologies are still to come in the near future. moreover; these ai need to be proven that can actually perform the tasks are designed for. currently, research institutions and al-based organisations are still working o ai-based products that are to clearly demonstrate worth and achievements as such, people remain doubtful on the methods that technology utilises in decision making and whether these decisions taken under different environment, more especially under duress are accurate and precise. this is coupled by the fact that ultimately, the probability due to mathematical uncertainty behind ai predictions still remains uncertain for most ai applications. consequently, it remains challenging to verify that the al system decision-making process is satisfactory _ data privacy and security is another challenge as most of the al applications are based on massive volumes of data to learn and make intelligent decisions. machine learning systems hinge on data that is regularly sensitive and personal in nature. since these systems learn from this sensitive data in order to improve themselves, there is a probability that these ai systems can  very hope systems deep prefer they they yet



apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development become prone to data breach and identity theft. consequently , the european union has implemented the general data protection regulation (gdpr) that ensure the complete protection of personal data. this was a measure that was enacted after careful considerations based on increasing awareness and sceptics in al end-users regarding an increasing number of machine-made decisions. furthermore , there is a unique method known as federated learning that is aimed at disrupting the al paradigm and encourage data scientists to develop al products and services without upsetting users data security and confidentiality. with respect to data scarcity, as much as more al-based institutions have more access to huge data presently, datasets that can enable ai applications to learn are actually rare. however, there has been a rise of al machines that are trained in supervised learning. but this kind of training requires labelled data. labelled data is organised such that it becomes easier for al machines to understand and learn. nonetheless, the downside of labelled data is that it is limited and future automated algorithms' creation increasingly more challenging to develop. however the upside   is the surge in investments towards design methodologies that focuses on how to create al models that can learn , despite the scarcity of labelled data _ generally, one of the major challenges of ai is that the accuracy of ai systems is dependent on the data on which the system is trained on_ this means that an al system is as as the data it learns from. if the al system is not trained sufficiently to generalise well enough, it can find patterns in the data that are inaccurate. a further challenge is that data required for training ai systems is not always available or in the required format. al techniques have proven to be effective in solving real-world problems. however, a number of these techniques, such as neural networks, are black box output_ for example , prediction is produced without any explanation as to how the output has been arrived at. for example_ management in industry ot finance may not be willing to accept a prediction o reliability of the ai system without the justification of how the prediction was arrived at. thus, the lack of transparency and interpretability is significant drawback. additionally , researchers are the problem of explanation already met in previous expert systems. however, a recent development in the field of ai,namely, explainable ai (xai) aims to address this issue the widespread use of al can be inhibited by the infrastructure and associated capital expenditure needed to set up and run such ai systems _ for example, multicore and gpu hardware for machine learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks_ mechanisms need to be identified to provide the necessary infrastructure in africa in order to promote the widespread use of ai needed in order to contribute to the economic growth of the continent: even though al has the potential for solving humanity' s challenges in africa, including accelerating the sdgs, africa is still faced with a numeral of challenges towards the priority areas as described in the following sections_ . investment opportunities and challenges the   pricewaterhousecoopers   published study showing the economic impact of artificial intelligence on the world s economy by . the study showed that al could improve global gdp by , which was approximated at $. trillion_ this could make ai the biggest commercial opportunity in the global economy. the report suggested that  will be and tipping for african'$ al adoption as the report estimated that al technology could also increase the gdp of africa, oceania, and other asian markets by . % which is about $. trillion (figure ). so, this stands to reason that africa can reap significant economic rewards from ai technology. nevertheless, the  government ai readiness index painted predictably glum image for the african continent in global indices of this nature. currently, there are no african countries in the top  positions of al innovation there are only  out of  african countries in the list that are in the  of ai innovation and development. the top  placed african governments included kenya, tunisia, mauritius, south africa, and ghana  the  countries reflected well-documented ai technology developments_ of the bottom  countries, are classified as the least developed countries_  making good facing grand point top

apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development thus, top african researchers should seek to attend global conferences to network  with colleagues  from other parts of the world and share their findings with the rest of the world. however, the challenge persists where most researchers are denied entry to countries where these conferences are held. for example _ african researches innovators who attempted to attend the neurips conference in canada, for the second year, more than half the african researchers who to showcase their work were denied visas_ this denial phenomenon systematically excludes african researchers from contributing to innovation at global level. it must be indicated that substantial investment in africa is channeled towards technologies such as ai as shown in figure and figure 8_ the al impact index is showing targeting and of investment into ai which is set to be the key source   of  transformation, disruption and   competitive advantage in today's   fast-changing   economy_ drawing on the findings  from the al impact index , it was   shown that   sector-by-sector and product-by-product impact of al will enable businesses to target opportunities, pinpoint threats and better address them. the analysis within the pwcs ai impact index includes the potential to free up time for consumers such as when utilising a driverless vehicle and enhance products and services quality and personalisation . additionally, of cases analysed in this study ai opportunities showed great potential for innovation, drivers, timings and high feasibility for ai adoption  for markets globally. however, african countries still need to improve the odds of adoption by reducing barriers such as the absence of enabling environments, increased corruption, availability of capital investment to start-ups companies (figure ) , accessibility to markets and more to overcome_ the areas with the biggest potential and associated timelines need to be outlined for african countries at a high level to assist businesses to target investment in the short-to-medium term_ for example, some aspects of change, such as robotic doctors, could be even more revolutionary but are further off. start up investments (sm) in  over sim in africa b k (tea[ han lat , rabcd  deals nnatc  (z0x| (collounded by woman ane  ure inpfntach *' ol fundlng gocs t0 {op $ lwd figure : start-up investment (sm) in  over $imin africa  applied timing unique iarda

be transferred to resulting predictions and decisions_ this kind of bias opens the possibility of discrimination-by-proxy, however, unintentional this discrimination might be. potential damages that emanate from machine learning practices include withholding economic, financial, and epistemic resources from certain social groups such as certain classes_ nationalities_ races or genders, based on inherent identity prejudice in data. the identity prejudice includes members of certain races, r persons of a certain age or nationality or gender, which may end up not having access to home loans and , even more serious, reinforcing existing prejudice via stereotyping, and under-representation for example, speech-to-text software may not be equipped to recognise female voices, and facial recognition software may fail to recognise black female faces. thus, there should be a culture of awareness of the impact of this kind of bias on society inherent to machine learning manifesting through their resultant decisions and predictions. moreover there is a recommendation that there must be agreements made between industry and government in order to ensure transparency and fairness in machine learning practices_ . machine ethics: social robots and the artificial moral agent project robot is an artificial entity that is   situated in our world. we are   faced with moral,  social, political, and economic challenges with robots in out private, work, and social spaces. from being focused o the  ds (dull, and dangerous work) , the field of robotics has exploded to focus o precision surgery, nasa, military robots, and social interaction with care robots for the people, as well as nanny robots. thus, the focus in this section was 0n robots in our social lives _ as aspects of other robots are covered in other sections in the chapter and report in general. in terms of social robots, designed activities such as care , companionship and nanny robots the following measures must be in place when the robots are deployed, through policy enactment_ the first measure is the definition of care and companionship should be made clear to ensure the well-being of humans interacting with these robots. secondly, pointing out the limitations of these robots in terms of reciprocal social interaction is necessity. and lastly , there should be some guideline of appropriate behaviour towards robots_ thus, the main point is to acknowledge the debate that exists  the benefits vs the risks of robot companions of all kinds. this means that, on one hand, there are concerns that the utilisation of care robots is unethical in terms of issues around human dignity, objectification, and shallowing of human social interaction. on the other hand, there is an acknowledgement of the immense potential for the improvement of the quality of life of the elderly and terminally ill via the use of care and companion robots_ the use of ai techniques in healthcare has huge benefits in biomedical research, diagnoses treatment options and delivery, and many other aspects_ however, the potential and ability of patients to adapt to changes in diagnostics and treatment as well as an emphasis on the responsibility of healthcare providers to maintain patients' dignity, confidentiality , safety, and privacy are imperative moral consequences of integrating al techniques into health care practices. thus, there are broader concerns with respect the ethical implications of social robotics include privacy issues, abuse of manufacturing of home and companion robots_ and the potential impact of abuse 0n the moral fibre of society. moreover, there is possible negative impact o the quality of human social skills. furthermore, integration with technology not only enhances human potential but also changes certain human characteristics. consequently_ we should not only ask about what will technology be like in the future but also what will humans be like in the future. this means_ as a consequence of ai, what are humans becoming:  dirty . during aged put

apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development ascertained that the responsibility to be fair and transparent when the processes of machine learning practices are used in the judiciary and properly explained. in addition, the related responsibility must be to ensure that data and models, as well as evidence , are of the best quality and that safety is high priority. future concerns include considering whether robots have rights, or whether they can be slaves, and whether it even makes sense to speak of robots mistreated _ there are numerous issues around privacy and confidentiality that accompany the integration of ai techniques into our social , economic, and personal lives. these issues include healthcare, education, and finance. property rights and privacy rights intersect in this 4ir context in fascinating ways. specifically , there are two areas that need to be flagged and taken note of for the social and secure of africa. firstly , there is the issue of ownership of data. one s own data may become one of the most valuable commodities of the future this then heightens the need for privacy laws and the need to ensure the public become literate with ai fundamentals. secondly, intersecting with this one is whether al is a private o social responses to this question will impact on how moral responsibility issues are  viewed and the nature of approaches   towards policy and regulatory initiatives_ . gender consideration al and deep learning are taking an increasing place in the daily and professional lives of people, not without exacerbating gender gaps. it is not a question of apprehension or cleavage linked to the capacity of women to create,develop, innovate,and disseminate knowledge pertaining to ai. but al is not different from other scientific fields. it is based on observed data that it may possibly reinforce inequality and social bias , more especially in the african continent_ the reasons the gap may develop are two-fold; the wider gap in ai technologies, as well as the undergoing risks associated with ai applications and systems unsuited towards africans' social and cultural contexts_ gender unsteadiness exists within the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (stem) fields, across the world it has been reported that in scientific research, women represent less than % of global researchers. moreover, women are less than % in ai-related fields _ in addition, this gap appears more visible for researchers from french-speaking countries than english- speaking countries. according to the ~global gender report "" and ""the al index "" there is limited studies available about such gender gaps in the african continent_ with regards to stem gender issues, segregation has been observed between males and females to be more significant within sub-saharan countries such as mozambique, lesotho, ghana, and ethiopia. south-africa is the only country listed in the ai-index-, and the proportion of female professors working in ai  space are  thus   exceeding the global world average of % . consequently , this imbalance will draw drastic consequences 0n the job market. it will also have an influence on al systems in the everyday life of african citizens_ thus_ to ensure that these technologies do not contribute to the increasing social and economic inequalities, general mobilisation is thus necessary. for example , african researchers, more especially women_ must be encouraged and supported to contribute to the design and the incorporation of local sensibilities, data, and knowledge in ai applications to avoid racial discrimination and bias values_ it has also been predicted that the job market will be significantly impacted by ai: ai will have negative impact on many digital  applications that are susceptible to automation more especially in industry. this is because ai may accelerate labour substitution. for example , clerical jobs and bank tellers' jobs that are currently and predominantly held by women are at high risk of elimination. this will be due to the introduction of intelligent software in computer vision, image analysis, natural languages understanding and processing, and proliferation of online chatbots. hence, african women are at the forefront of the struggle to preserve africa s   varied cultures, languages, and identities to fully harness the deployment of ai. moreover , intelligent automation engine is coming with women voices, namely eliza, alexa, cortana, and siri. however the accents and names of these digital voices are foreign to the african environment and exacerbating the existing gender divides because it's presenting women as better in these secondary roles. even though it is difficult to predict the future, but national governments and african scientific institutions have the responsibility to address the scarcity of women in al and invest more on sustainable development  cyber being - good good . guide gender gender gender gap



apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development . conclusion for the advancement of ai technologies, numerous social-cultural , ethical and gender issues must be considered. the educational and work considerations must address the ethics of ai, legal challenges, and the accompanying socio-cultural challenges_ these flagged issues for a better adaptation of a need further research , policymaking, and legislation among african member states_ for example, for africa to better support education and work framework systems_ there is a need to reformulate the resulting implications of primary, secondary and tertiary exposure, and training: there are considerations such as the integration of al into our everyday lives with regards to children_ for example , there is need to monitor and evaluate the impact of social media on the quality of human interaction such as isolation and bullying on social media. moreover , social exclusion and inequalities could arise because of the domain of information ethics, where smart cities integrate al into the inhabitants homes via the internet of things. therefore, africa should focus o education and the future of work opportunities for the youth, more especially women and girls. gender unsteadiness within stem fields has been reported to show that less than  of women in the global scientific research community. furthermore, women are less than  in al-related fields, more especially among researchers from french-speaking countries than english-speaking countries. thus, african countries need to bridge or address these stem gaps issues this imbalance will draw drastic consequences on the job market if it remains unaddressed. this chapter describes the need for research of ai in africa and what should inform the nature of research conducted therein by a nation or region_ it also establishes that the ordinary people and government officials should be able to understand appreciate and apply the results of research problems in ai. not only must africa increase its human capacity in the field of ai in order to innovate, but it must also conduct studies in pedagogy. ai pedagogy can introduce the concept of ai unto children and enable a seamless way of living. for emphasis, examples of national al strategies across the globe are provided to illustrate the seriousness with which several developed and developing nations have taken this challenge.  gender

apet report ai for africa: artificial intelligence for africa's socio-economic development with the african context. hence, this report on the ai-powered future in africa is of utmost   importance and urgent_ therefore the academic   community _ policymakers and scientific   corporations have an important role to address the opportunities and challenges presented by ai: . qualifications, reskilling, and employability in the 4th industrial revolution, al has become interdisciplinary in that it features into various facets of socio-economic challenges of africa including health, finance, agriculture , and  manufacturing: thus_ african universities  should ascertain that the qualifications currently offered, more especially computer science degrees can sufficiently equip african graduates with the skills necessary to meet the challenges posed by the 4th industrial revolution incorporating ai. therefore, a review of curricula at universities, together with input from industrial and relevant sectors, should be conducted to determine whether curricula include the relevant building blocks that can sufficiently equip graduates for their particular careers in the 4th industrial revolution_ there is also a skills gap within the current workforce that will need to be bridged to provide people with the necessary skills to deal with new challenges in their jobs changes as a result of ai. african countries need to identify these affected sectors of the workforce. this will be necessary depending o the infrastructure of that particular country and may require to in place mechanisms_ such as short courses and certification, to provide the necessary support needed to skills of its citizens and workforce_ one of the growing concerns emanating from the incremental role that al is playing is the loss of jobs. in several sectors, ai will complement jobs, helping to reduce workload and worker fatigue. however, there will also be a skills shift that will result in certain jobs becoming redundant; but new jobs the skills shift needs to be managed to reduce unemployment resulting  from this development. in addition, planning needs to be done with industry and the various sectors_ this can be carried out by firstly identifying what the skills shift will be and which parts of the workforce will be affected by this advancement: after identifying these gaps, public and private institutions may need to provide timeous training: this training will equip the workforce with the necessary skills needed to move into the new jobs brought about by al and 4ir . conclusion african must focus on youth and skill development as they are intricately connected. since africa has young population, african countries have the opportunity to exploit this demographic dividend. this will improve the chances of african countries into being able to meet the socio-economic needs of their citizens and present a to prosperity. thus, al makes this ambition feasible_ african countries should build on the enthusiasm and exploit that young people are already establishing themselves in developing artificial intelligence, machine learning and data science there is tremendous enthusiasm from young people self- organising around the continent in finding ways to practise and learn ai-based skills. moreover, africans should be creators and knowledgeable ai users and avoid being just consumers of al technologies. additionally , african countries must start ai education and skill- building much earlier in children lives_ when children are in school, should be taught computing (including al) in such a way that can understand its ubiquity in their lives as well as become smarter users and developers_ this challenge is not just in ai, but there is also a scarcity of digital , mathematical and data skills across the african continent_ thus, african countries must  reintroduce these skills to formal education systems, as well as those individuals already in employment:  arising put upgrade arising: path they they

national strategy for artificial intelligence ngenuity and the entrepreneurial have always driven mankind to seek improvement and to resolve problems as they arise. during the twentieth century, human intelligence enabled the development of technologies that opened up new horizons in our economic and social systems, fostering extraordinary advances in science, industry and services, in resource allocation, public management, governance and the welfare state 0ar8 one such technology is that of artificial intelligence (ai), which has impacted all areas of activity, throughout the world_ catalysing research and innovation, and making the generation, storage and processing of data' an economic sector in itself in the new scenario of digital and technological development. in consequence, a dramatic transformation is taking place in many sectors, including environmental protection; energy; industry; tourism; transport; mobility and logistics; food production; banking and insurance; retail commerce; construction; creative and cultural industries; and vital strategic sectors such as health, education and national security. the spanish government is resolved to promote the development of al and its integration into the productive fabric, the economy and society. this public leadership will play a crucial role in ensuring that technological development is always for the public benefit, helping safeguard our values and rights and the welfare state_ appropriate action in health, education, justice and social welfare, together with the provision of an effective system  f public benefits , are fundamental to the national good and a hallmark of spain's identity. building on basic research and innovation, and using the results obtained to modernise our productive fabric, underpin areas of public activity and enhance digital skills 8e1! training programmes, al can be an important vector of economic growth, creating a virtuous of action and reaction between technology and our political, social, economic and industrial systems_ with the growing presence of al throughout the productive economy, the inclusion of women at all levels of skills training, production, science and technology is an issue 0f the utmost importance. technological advances must be employed as a means of eliminating the many gaps still apparent in our country, according to  gender, age , urban vs. rural living, financial means and education_ spirit big key cycle



national strategy for artificial intelligence the central question underlying the development and spread 0f al is that of the ethical dimension. the widespread use and management of data through the application of algorithms and autonomous systems has multiple ethical and moral implications . in consequence, appropriate processes and control mechanisms must be employed t0 protect our values, principles and rights. among other initiatives , the present strategy includes the development  f a digital rights charter and the creation of mechanisms to supervise the ethics  f ai , in order to facilitate consensus on a suitable framework for this technological development_ this national strategy is not proposed as a definitive, closed document, 0f a merely administrative nature, but rather as a dynamic and flexible framework, open to contributions from the business world_ the general population, social agents and other public administrations. the government has undertaken this project from an inclusive perspective, seeking to integrate all elements  f society, and thus achieve an inclusive, sustainable economy. it is als0 a shared commitment with our european partners, aimed at helping the eu become a leader in the deployment  f inclusive, ethical, reliable and economically efficient ai. spain has made great progress and is well placed to become a leading voice , in europe and throughout the world, in innovation and technological development. its tightly-woven infrastructure, the leading role played in the rollout of 5g technology (crucial for data development) , the strength  f the university system and capabilities in areas such as high-performance computing , cybersecurity , al itself and other digital-enabling technologies , provide a solid basis with which t0 address intense digitalisation and technological disruption. these factors, together, represent a magnificent opportunity for us to put the digital transition into practice, focusing public actions on people's needs and interests, ensuring that none are left behind and safeguarding the fundamental rights and values on which european societies are based. pedro sanchez castejon president of the government november  big key



introduek i



national strategy for artificial intelligence introduction what is artificial intelligence? just as human intelligence is hard to delne, no formal, universally-accepted delnition has been  established for artilcial  intelligence (ai): the european commission recently proposed the following: artificial  intelligence (ai) systems are software (and possibly als0 hardware) systems designed by humans that, given a complex goal, act in the physical or digital dimension by perceiving their environment through data acquisition, interpreting the collected structured or unstructured data reasoning on the knowledge, or processing the information, derived from this data and deciding the best action(s) to take to achieve the given al systems can either use symbolic rules or learn a numeric model, and they can als0 adapt their behaviour by analysing how the environment is affected by their previous actions. although al (rst appeared as an academic discipline in , it subsequently underwent various cycles in which periods of high expectation alternated with others when less attention was paid to this topic. initial systems were based on human programming and pre-set decision-making processes, but the recent conjunction 0f several crucial factors has produced an exponential in the capabilities and influence  f ai , which is now expanding irreversibly within economic and social structures, via autonomous systems that are capable both of learning and of setting their own programmes for action, through the analysis 0f e volumes 0f data_ in this respect, significant enabling factors include: the enormous growth in the amount of data available advances in the power and capacity of computing and storage systems: successful research and development of new algorithms and machine learning methods.

national strategy for artificial intelligence  action plan to achieve the strategy aims described above, six strategy lines have been delned, incorporating the priority actions to be carried out during the period - and defining specific targets for this period. strategy pillar  promote scientilc research, technological development and innovation in ai to strategically anticipate coming events, in an environment of increasingly rapid technological change, it is essential t0 generate new knowledge and ensure its effective transfer to the productive fabric and to the administrative sector these tasks must b e undertaken with a double focus: (i) on the one hand, considering the current interests and demands of companies and institutions that need to implement mature al technologies, fundamentally to optimise resources and procedures based on the exploitation  f large databases; (ii) on the other hand it is als0 necessary for the strategy to respond to medium to long-term interests, looking beyond the immediate horizon to focus on the generation  f new emerging techniques that will allow new businesses to develop and established ones to enter sectors not previously considered. strategy pillar  promote digital capabilities, empower national capabilities and attract global skills in the (eld of ai with respect to ai , the technical capabilities  f the active population (both the workforce in general and specialists) must b e enhanced, in order to facilitate access to new , high-quality jobs and t0 overcome the challenges encountered in the future labour market. in addition t0 scientific-technical skills training, it will als0 be necessary t0 extend training in the social sciences to address the many significant aspects  f ai from an interdisciplinary standpoint. strategy pillar 3_ develop data platforms and technological infrastructures in support of ai digitalisation, access to large volumes of data, the development of general purpos e al platforms incorporating resources (data, corpora, lexicons, ontologies, models etc.), algorithms and inference engines, together with supercomputing infrastructure or other high-performance, high-processing capacity mechanisms: all  f these elements are essential for the development of al, for its use and promotion by government administrations and for its low or zero-cost availability to innovative smes and researchers. beyond investing in the generation of new data sets and data infrastructures , the efficient management and governance 0f data use must als0 be ensured, in accordance with principles 0f interoperability, integrity, reliability, quality and legality. at the same time, citizens rights, privacy and confidentiality must be protected, as called for by european initiatives such as the european open source cloud and by spanish legislation on data protection_ and



national strategy for artificial intelligence  strategy pillar  incorporate al into value chains t0 transform the economic fabric digitalisation, innovation and the incorporation  f al into value chains is a fundamental  pportunity to change the pattern of economic growth in spain, one in which human and technological capital may be expanded, reducing environmental impacts_ raising productivity and enhancing the potential t0 grow intensively and sustainably, thus increasing well-being in society and generating high-quality e mployment. strategy pillar5  enhance the use of al in government administration and in national strategic missions the relationship between al and government administration is one 0f mutual benefit _ on the o ne hand , al heightens transparency and facilitates the communication  f public activity in sectors such as health care, social services, the environment, energy , justice transport, logistics, education, employment and security_ at the same time, it provides a more accurate picture 0f our society and makes it possible to determine priorities for action, identifying areas with competitive advantages and those which are most disadvantaged. in turn, government activities foster the acceptance and use  f al by providing finance and promotion and by integrating al into the administrative process_ in the final instance_ it is society at large that benefits from the introduction and application  f ai , and   the citizenry should monitor  government activities_ exploit the proximity achieved and make use 0f al applications that respond to individual circumstances. strategy pillar 6_ establish an ethical and regulatory framework that reinforces the protection of individual and collective rights, in order to guarantee inclusion and social welfare. the development and deployment  f al has great potential and raises expectations_ but it may als0 create uncertainty due to its ethical, legal, social and economic implications_ if spain is t0 place itself at the political and social forefront  f this technological revolution, an appropriate framework for action must b e created_ moreover , w e must consider whether the current rules and standards for coexistence will continue to be appropriate, whether the ethical and legal framework that has served us to date will still be sufficient, and what adjustments may b e needed to protect individuals in a digital world. in all of these respects, ethical and democratic ideals must prevail over the development  f ai _ furthermore, the action framework arising from these considerations will be complementary to the corresponding social and political debate and to the regulatory procedures that will be required for each case.



national strategy for artificial intelligence  the strategy, moreover, addresses major social challenges that must be overcome if al is to be inclusive and sustainable, such as reducing gender and digital   inequalities, reinforcing territorial cohesion and assuring the ecological transition: social challenge l reduce the gender gap in al as concerns employment and leadership. the first results obtained from the map of al capabilities in spain confirm the existence  f a marked gender gap , due to inequality between women and men in scientific and social studies (i.e . science, technology , engineering , the arts and mathematics steam) as well as in employment and leadership in the field  f al . this imbalance is a major vulnerability in our economy and society, and  gender equality is one  f the principal, and cross-cutting, aims 0f the strategy. in fact, spain already has a higher proportion of female researchers than the eu average25(  .  % vs  .  % ) , according t0 ine and eurostat data, which means the country is well positioned to further narrow the gender gap. social challenge : foster the ecological transition and reduce the carbon footprint: in addition to the above, an ecological transition, spanning all sectors, must be undertaken to focus al activities on the good of the planet, in two respects in particular: firstly, by promoting energy-efficient data storage and computing systems (both in the development  f hardware and in employing more efficient processes for algorithm design and training_ via approaches such as the systematic analysis of the energy consumption of the applications considered) , while minimising its own environmental footprint_ secondly, by orienting al and digital-enabling technologies to address global challenges , to support the implementation 0f the paris agreement on climate change26, to achieve the un sustainable development goals, to make the european green deal a success and to drive the transition towards a circular economy, especially in the fields of agriculture, food and consumer electronics. social challenge : reinforce territorial cohesion. territorial cohesion can be defined as the existence 0f a consistent internal structure throughout the country_ in the present context, this refers to the organisation, extension, development and coverage of digital infrastructures, in particular those related to the national strategy for ultrafast networks27, including broadband. territorial g overnance and coordination between various levels of government (national, regional and local) can benefit from digitalisation and the development of ai. science technology engineering arts mathematics z5 ciencia gob.es/stfls/micinn/ministerio/ficheros/eecti--.pdf  consilium europa eules/policies/climate-changelparis-agreement/ z _ es/planes-tic/agenda-digital descargasagendadigital/planes%2oespec%c3%adficos/plan-adpe-1_redes-ultrarrapidas:pdf 2de 'gob.



national strategy for artificial intelligence  greater cohesion , in conjunction with al , will als0 contribute to territorial revitalisation and modernisation and help reverse the regressive dynamics that have been observed in some areas in recent years. finally, territorial cohesion will facilitate the adoption of al at all levels of the productive fabric , within agencies of government administration and throughout the services offered, social challenge  narrow the digital divide. digital literacy is the ability t0 locate, organise, understand , evaluate and analyse information using digital technology. accordingly, it goes beyond merely learning to use the tools_ countries, companies and individuals are developing these skills at different rates, which is creating a new gap , termed the digital (or technological) divide certain groups , at risk  f social exclusion or experiencing this situation, are especially vulnerable to the digital divide if the problem is not addressed and overcome as a matter 0f urgency, the emergence  f al will b e an additional factor weighing on the social exclusion that is suffered by many , further distancing them from society and employment_ in spain, for example, the younger population are especially well placed to adopt technological advances and profit from them. great opportunities exist for them in the digitalisation of jobs and in the introduction  f icts in the workplace. further openings arise with the specific training needed for teachers28 understanding the benefits of digital technology, accessing it, and using it t0 communicate_ and perhaps even creating digital content; these are s0me 0f the skills that must b e much more widely acquired to narrow the digital divide companies and other organisations must realise that ensuring an effective digital transformation is an issue 0f the highest priority in the drive ' to increase productivity and competitiveness in today' s globalised world_ annex  describes the relationship between the strategy lines and the objectives sought.   i org/spain/skills-outlook-spain-es:pdf

entrepreneurs and developers who are success stories in various ai fields, i am very reassured by and grateful to all of you: i am pleased to inform you first of presidential initiative for artificial intelligence fellow koreans, ai is the companion of humanity humans became the masters of the earth as came to have intelligence and, at the same time, began to take unlimited responsibility for this world. human beings might be the only creature with high intelligence in the vast universe: however; we are prone to err and often make irrational decisions. humanitys intellectual exploration has helped unceasingly expand its own intellectual ability al is the culmination of a human dream to constantly complement shortcomings and become more perfect: the era of the fourth industrial revolution is indeed an age in which imagination can change the world. korea is neither the first country to have ushered in the era of artificial intelligence nor the country with the best ai technology at present: however; the country has people capable of turning their imagination into reality and taking on challenges to pursue novelty even in the throes of the  asian financial crisis, the country led the internet revolution and now boasts world-class manufacturing competitiveness, globally unmatched ict infrastructure and abundant data concerning e-government: if we link artificial intelligence primarily with the sectors in which we ve accumulated extensive experience and competitiveness, such as manufacturing and semiconductors, we will be able to give birth to the smartest yet most humanlike artificial intelligence: the government will join forces with developers to help them fully utilize their imaginations and turn their ideas into reality: first, we il create an environment where can exercise their imagination to the fullest, work together and take on new challenges. among the numerous theories on human intelligence, feel particularly drawn to the that its development has been to further cooperation. if we ensure that developers can turn their imagination into reality by switching to so-called negative regulatory system defined by the principle of approve first, regulate later' and if we enable scientists, engineers, artists and students to cooperate by boldly tearing down barriers between different sectors, our countrys al will bring about the fastest progress in the world: we ma will also create a new model of global cooperation through an ai olympics, a festival of creative ideas and technologies, and the ai grand challenge where the best brains participate in solving pending issues. in addition to existing policies concerning the establishment of al graduate schools and the innovation academy we will allow universities to create new, or expand existing, majors related to high-tech fields. university professors will be permitted to hold positions in companies concurrently, which will attract the worlds best minds to our country we will  actively cooperate with the national assembly to ensure that the three bills concerning the data economy are before the end of this year:  writing they they theory help passed



second, we will provide support companies to earn profits the government has earmarked . trillion won in next budget for data, networks and ai, up  percent from this we will create an environment in which companies can confidently invest in areas where theyre competitive and quickly make profits we will intensively funnel our policy funds into startups that will determine our future and will create an industrial ecosystem where innovation continues perpetually: the government will make preemptive investments in such sectors as next-generation ai chips so as to secure a leading position in the global market: data and cloud computing are needed in the age of ai the government will fundamentally innovate the establishment; opening and utilization of data sources at stage. open data will be made available to the in principle, and the government will expand its support for the high-capacity cloud computing needed for the development of ai by businesses, universities and research institutions third, we will be unrivalled in terms of our use of ai: the more people use ai without fear; the more our industry can grow: opportunities to learn about al will be provided to everyone: young people in their 20s searching for jobs, employees in their 30s and 40s seeking career changes, those in their 50s and 60s preparing for a second-career opportunity after retirement, and seniors. the government will make sure that al can be utilized and consumed without restraint_ fourth, the government will become al-oriented. right after the inauguration, my administration launched the presidential committee on the fourth industrial revolution. it selected 'data, network, and ai(dna)' as three new innovative industries and has supported them: last year; 'ai randd strategy' and data industry vitalization strategy' were put in place at the pan-government level and have steadily been implemented. the government itself will actively use and support ai at every opportunity: we will transform ourselves into an a - based digital government, going beyond the worlds best e-government: we will provide high- quality services, starting with those areas that can directly impact the peoples lives such as the environment; disasters, safety and national defense, so that the can sense the changes. the governments public services will also be transitioned to internet- and smartphone-based ones fellow koreans, distinguished ai developers and entrepreneurs, the advancement of al lead humanity into a world never experienced before. al will not only affect industrial sectors but also solve many issues facing our society: public health in an aging society welfare for senior citizens living alone, the safety of women living by themselves and the prevention of crimes that are becoming more sophisticated: let us work together so that al can operate in people - centered manner and become a driving force behind social innovation: by the end of this year; the government will propose a national ai strategy based on this framework initiative for completely new ai: the korean government will also pay special attention to changes in the job market and ai-related ethical issues_ the development of innovative technologies will be achieved through sharing and interaction like at deview 2019_ iask you to share your rich experience and wisdom filled with innovative imagination: i everyone will work together to realize our dream. thank you: national strategy for artificial intelligence years year: public every public _ will hope



foreword the world is entering a new era of transformation, the 4th industrial revolution, and artificial intelligence(ai) is at the center of this revolution: ai, which only existed in the imagination in the past, is rapidly growing based on the development of icts such as the increase of computing power; data accumulation, and network advancement such as 5g. ai has started to be used and spread through all industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, environment; and education, and we can now easily encounter it in almost aspect of our daily lives. artificial intelligence, with its cognitive, learning, and reasoning abilities, is expected to assist or replace human intellectual functions in the future, in the same way as machines such as steam engines substituted human physical labor in the age of industrialization. ai will create new added value by catalyzing innovation throughout the industries, provide people with greater convenience in their daily lives, and will also be powerful way to resolve social problems such as population aging and crime prevention: in the al era, ai fundamentally changes the way of working and the job structure, while proliferation of al could present dysfunction and security threats therefore, rather than accepting these changes passively, we should be active change agents in creating a brighter future. i think it is time for us to prepare for a world where people and artificial intelligence can coexist. for this, in december last year; the government adopted a government-wide national for artificial intelligence under the vision of toward ai world leader beyond it"" in an effort to give to the ""presidential initiative for artificial intelligence (oct. )"" announced by president moon jae-in: the strategy focused on maximizing our national strengths such as the worlds best ict infrastructure and semiconductor and manufacturing technology while realizing people-centered artificial intelligence with consideration and respect for people; beyond technical and industrial viewpoints if the public and private sectors work together to successfully implement this national strategy we can secure world-class digital competitiveness and significantly improve the quality of life for people by . we are standing at an important crossroads where the of our future generations are at stake: in the meantime; we have to enhance our nations capacities to raise our status as the worlds top- economy and to enable to enjoy a more affluent and happier life. in the era of ai that harmonizes with innovation and engagement, would welcome your active interest and participation in opening a new al era for the republic of korea_ minister; ministry of science and ict choi kiyoung national strategy for artificial intelligence huge every strategy shape lives people future

executive summary over six decades, the evolutionary development of al has been astonishing and proves its capability  through   simple neural networks, multi-level text   analytics, deep learning,  image analytics, self-adaptive and natural language processing breakthroughs, neuromorphic technology, and the edge of human consciousness   system development: al has been implemented and adopted in business sectors for a variety of purposes in manufacturing; health care, retail, banking, and public services the rapid development of al calls out key areas that need to be addressed in any future policy or law governing the use of al, such as privacy, accountability,  safety, and security; transparency and explainability; fairness and non- discrimination; human control of technology; professional responsibility; and promotion of human values. firms and organizations across all sectors strive to maximize the potential of their data to make better decisions for commercial and social purposes: from a technical perspective , there are several types of al applications, such as machine learning, deep learning, hybrid learning; and digital twins: some of the industries seen as benefiting from al in cambodia are healthcare, education, and finance. for healthcare, al can be used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnoses and identify potential health risks and preventative measures for example, al can analyze medical images and identify abnormalities such as tumors or other potential health issues. in addition; al can be used in education in cambodia to improve the quality and accessibility of education. another area where al is beginning to have an impact in cambodia is finance. al is being used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of financial transactions and identify potential fraud and money laundering: overall; the development and adoption of al in cambodia is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to transform many aspects of society. the key challenges and opportunities in this area include the need for specialized skills and expertise, as well as the need to address ethical and privacy concerns. with continued investment and development; al has the potential to greatly benefit cambodia in the coming years. strategically, randd is essential to cope with the al-enabled advancements in the world: with billions of dollars expected to be generated from al globally, cambodia sees the need and urgency to invest, adapt, and prepare for this al global force in line with the industry . trend as the economy increasingly becomes knowledge- and digital-based. there are many challenges and concerns that come with the use of al. certainly, machine learning requires massive amounts of data and computing time. researchers are generally challenged when it comes to finding high-quality, unbiased training sets to teach al. in many cases, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of records, are required to properly implement deep learning algorithms. and data sets containing biased information can lead to undesirable results. there are other cultural challenges to consider that branch out into new issues for leadership. vii



when it comes to incorporating al. also, there has been much written about how al will take jobs away from unskilled or easily automated workers: in cambodia, this technology is not just about al. it is about creating a digital framework within the existing infrastructure to implement its learning capability alongside the work of information and communication technology. relevant legal framework on data and cybersecurity is also needed to be in force to combat cybercrimes and provide assurance to relevant businesses, practitioners, and consumers in the field. infrastructure is the and there is already a basic technological foundation that cambodia has been building for years that will be leveraged to maximize the impact of al: last but not least, al is one of the essential technologies in the world that is game-changing in every   sector to improve   productivity,  efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. in order to foster trustworthy al ecosystems, it is essential for countries to develop human-centered policies that promote socio-economic and responsible al research and development. this includes policies that encourage investment in such initiatives. these policies for al development should take into account its national development vision as well as regional and global trends: the country's objectives, preferences, and overarching strategy for al advancement in the immediate and distant future should be clarified. initially, the main objective is to cultivate skilled personnel and employ al solutions to deal with critical national focus areas that will have a swift impact on cambodia's socio-economic status. over time, the priority should shift to developing fundamental and advanced research, promoting high-level al research and innovation; and establishing cambodia's standing in advanced technology on a global: viii key,

1_ the boundless potential of al: adoption and regulations .. trend-megatrends the fast-moving trend of artificial intelligence (al) has gained its impetus to fundamentally change the business and economy landscape and society for the last few years the term artificial intelligence (al) was first coined in  to broadly address the machine simulation of intelligence where the machine can simulate every aspect of learning and feature of intelligence (lau and haugh, ). over six decades, the evolutionary development of al is astonishing and proofs its capability from simple neural networks, multi-level text analytics, deep learning; image analytics, self-adaptive and natural language processing breakthrough, neuromorphic technology, and the edge of human consciousness system development: at this new stage of al commercialisation; the ecosystem of industries is   disrupted and expectedly   forcibly transformed into digital and technological capability at various layers (deloitte, ); firstly, the enterprise with maturity in al application and capable resources will use al in both management and production processes to foresee, with the use of data-mining, the global megatrend and the ability of their products and services to be commercialised. this enterprise change will cover sales, security, anti-fraud, human resource management; marketing, personal assistant; and smart tools: the second layer of industry change is expected to optimise the relationship between   upstream and downstream sectors on the traditional   industry chain where the consumer can access the product features directly. this industry change will take its course in finance, healthcare, education, retail, manufacturing, media, agriculture, and logistics, to name a lastly, the future labor structure of enterprises will be transformed with virtual and augmented realities, gesture recognition, and robots to increase productivity and competitiveness: the embrace of al among asean member states (ams) , of which % of asean is at the early stages, and % of asean is at advanced stages, is still at the nascent stages given the differences in the national priority, strategic investment, piloting initiatives within discrete activities, scaling initiatives, and end-to-end scaled implementation of al (chua and dobberstein, ). the potential of al contribution to the region's growth domestic product (gdp) is forecasted to be approximately uss trillion, accounted for about  to % of dgp uplift across ams in . nevertheless; the impact variance will be varied from one ams to another based on the country's maturity in terms of al infrastructure and adoption readiness; for instance, cambodia, at the early stage of al adoption, focuses more on the primary sectors (chua and dobberstein, )- the top five sectors which will benefit from al include () manufacturing; () retail and hospitality, () agriculture, () government, safetylsecurity, and smartcities, () healthcare. with industry . technologies; al could further advance the entire value chain, from product engineering and supply chain management to logistics and circular management: while having a dynamic and few:



mobile-centric population, the asean region will boost retail and hospitality with machine learning and big data advancement. for the agricultural sector; drone and image recognition technologies will contribute to the prevention of crop diseases, pesticide and fertiliser application, and post- harvest management: amid the complexity of challenges pertaining to the public sectors, al will play essential role in resources' optimisation, traffic   congestion relief; education; and healthcare such as the accessibility to healthcare service, tracking, and management of infectious diseases. al is no longer the futuristic term in cambodia as the al community is exponentially growing while al technologies have become a reality and used in various sectors. early al community is seen in  , i.e. an open-source algorithms community to develop al skills in cambodia, initiated by a regional start-up, wwwslash co. one such al application is the flood detection system, managed by people in need,; to potentially identify ""false positive"" alarms and predict flood risk among other projects: identity match, fraud detection, smart city, khmer chatbot;, ekyc[know your customer] system, and al for real estate business. another deployment of al is the demine robotics with the three key functions: () detect; () retrieve, and () destroy and the uniqueness of this robot is its small size, strength, intelligence , machine efficiency, machine sensitivity, and data collection: other al  prototypes include scara robot, 4dof robot manipulator; dual axis solar tracker; drone (hexacopter) , and mobile robot using omni wheel, at   intelligent mechatronics   laboratory, institute of   technology of cambodia: universities including the national institute of posts, telecommunications and ict with new name as cambodia academy of digital technology, the american university of phnom penh, kirirom institute of technology, and the institute of technology of cambodia offer courses in al, which will nurture the local talent. while constrained by the lockdown and health-safety measures, the early transformation of the soft and hard infrastructure of business could be seen across cambodia: the earliest is the dine-in restaurant; where the service is turned to only takeaway and delivery. the drive-through and curbside restaurant and stores become relianton the pre-order and delivery app. the school is closed, and the physical classroom becomes online. digital platforms and services viz foodpanda, nham24, bloc, cambodia aeon online, become overnight popular. as such; al integration will be potential for business in cambodia. .. need al adoption artificial intelligence has the capability to simulate intelligent, human-like behavior in computers, high speed with cutting-age technology, where the applications of al are enormous including finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, education, agriculture, transportation, law, etc. there are various forms of al, such as machine learning; expert systems, robotics, neural networks, fuzzy logic, and natural language processing: for instance, machine learning in which machines could encompass neural networks and deep learning; like our human brains, can observe, analyse, and  an



learn from facts and errors rather than being told what to believe: this technology has an impact on consumer items and has resulted in important discoveries in healthcare and physics, as well as changes in industries as diverse as manufacturing, banking, and retail. over time , machine learning algorithms increase their performance by learning from data. in this way, computers can adapt to conditions that are unforeseen and cannot be codified by static rules. driving a car and chatting with a customer are examples of such jobs. on rare occasions, the computer may even come up with a solution that no human has ever thought of (marr, ; smart nation digital government office, ). for instance, al has been implemented and adopted in industry for a variety of purposes, including (marr , ; sas institute inc-, ): manufacturing: al can be used to optimise areas of production such as yield, energy or throughput optimisation, assembly, and quality testing during the manufacturing process heath care: a personal health care assistant will be able to help with daily tasks (medicine, exercise, diet; detect the patient illness symptom) and to predict chronic disease retail: consumers may do virtual shopping, receive tailored suggestions, and discuss their purchasing alternatives. with the help of al, the business will grow faster banking: al improves speed, precision , effectiveness of human error with ability to detect the fraudulent of unusual transactions, etc public sector: make smart cities smarter, support the national defense, enhance effectiveness of the public services, etc. the application of al is limitless: it will always depend on its purpose, ie. who and where should al be adopted, must be carefully determined: . alignment to vision artificial intelligence's progress and spread provide new and significant problems for technologists, humanity, and sentient life in general. the question of what_~or whose_~values al systems should be associated with is the most important of these (gabriel, ) furthermore, there is a lack of clarity and consistency in the worldwide debates about al that are taking place among governments and the private sector on what the guiding principles should be for policymakers, academics,  and companies. there is widespread agreement that legislative   guidelines and safeguards are needed for the use of ai/ml (artificial intelligence/machine learning) in healthcare; but; before effective legislation can be developed, there must be consensus on the technology's vision and goal.  key



regulation is built on the foundation of pre-existing ideas and beliefs about what technology is, what it seeks to achieve, and how it should be utilised: this involves () determining how it will not be utilised and () assessing the risks that should be avoided. organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd) al principles identify as the following (oecd, ): al should benefit people and the planet by driving inclusive growth, sustainable development; and well-being al systems should be designed in a way that respects the rules of law, human rights; democratic values, and diversity, and should include appropriate safeguards for example, enabling human intervention where necessary to ensure a fair and just society there should be transparency and responsible disclosure around al systems to ensure that people understand al-based outcomes and can challenge them al systems must function in a robust, secure and safe way throughout their life cycles, and potential risks should be continually assessed and managed organisations and  individuals  developing, deploying or operating al systems should be held accountable for their proper functioning in line with the above principles: the oecd also provides specific recommendations to governments on to put these value- based principles into action: facilitate public and private investment in research and development to spur innovation in trustworthy al foster  accessible al ecosystems with   digital infrastructure and technologies and mechanisms to share data and knowledge ensure a policy environment that will open the way to deployment of trustworthy al systems empower people with the skills for al and support workers for a fair transition co-operate across borders and sectors to progress on responsible stewardship of trustworthy al. the application of the oecd principles is still questioning since many organisations have their own principles of al usage as well these themes call out areas that need to be addressed in any future policy or law governing the use of al such as privacy, accountability, safety and security, transparency and explainability,  fairness and non-discrimination, human control of technology, professional responsibility, and promotion of human values. to fit with cambodia's vision of the future for utilisation of al, strategic adaptation of al usage, the concepts from the oecd and other major organisations should be examined in order to develop country rule, they how key



legislation, regulation, and guidelines on how al should be utilised for government, private, and corporate purposes. . al-powered business and industry: transforming business landscape in cambodia . . business artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionise many aspects of business, from improving decision-making and automation to enabling new products and services. in recent years, al has become increasingly widespread in business, with many organisations adopting al technologies to a competitive edge. however, cambodian businesses are yet to take a full advantage of al solutions. one of the key ways that al is being used in business is for decision-making and automation: al algorithms are able to process vast amounts of data and identify patterns and trends that can inform business decisions  this allows organisations to make more accurate and efficient decisions, which can lead to improved operations and increased profitability. in addition, al is being used to automate many tasks and processes in business: for example, al algorithms can be used to automate customer service, data entry, and other routine tasks, freeing up employees to focus on more complex and value-added activities. this can help to increase productivity and reduce costs. in cambodia; simple machine al for use in industrial factories is being developed by quantum engineering and manufacturing: another area where al is having a significant impact on business is in the development of new products and services. al algorithms are being used to create personalised experiences for customers, such as personalised product recommendations and personalised content: this can help to improve customer satisfaction and fidelity , and can also drive revenue growth. however; the use of al in business is not without its challenges one of the key issues is the need for specialised skills and expertise. developing and deploying al algorithms requires a high level of technical knowledge, and many organisations may struggle to find the necessary talent: in addition; there are often ethical and privacy concerns surrounding the use of al in business, and organisations need to carefully consider these issues some of the industries that can benefit from al in cambodia are healthcare, education, and finance. for healthcare, al can be used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnoses; and to identify potential health risks and preventative measures. for example, al can analyse medical images and identify abnormalities, such as tumors or other potential health issues: this can help to improve the quality of healthcare and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis: there are currently already developed equipment and tools that cambodian healthcare centers can acquire and implement:  gain



in addition, al can be used in education in cambodia to improve the quality of and accessibility to education: for example, al can be used to create personalised learning experiences for students, allowing them to learn at their own pace and in a way that is tailored to their individual needs. this can help to improve student outcomes and increase the efficiency of the education system. another area where al is beginning to have an impact in cambodia is in finance. al is being used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of financial transactions, and to identify potential fraud and money laundering: this can help improve the security and reliability of the financial system, and can also help increase the access to financial services for individuals and businesses: al is transforming many aspects of business, and its impact is to continue to grow in the coming years. organisations that are able to effectively adopt and integrate al technologies are likely to gain a competitive advantage, while those that are unable to do so may struggle to keep pace in the competition. overall, the development and adoption of al in cambodia is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to transform many aspects of society: the key challenges and opportunities in this area include the need for specialised skills and expertise, as well as the need to address ethical and privacy concerns: with continued investment and development, al has the potential to greatly benetit cambodia in the coming years. .. infrastructure artificial intelligence is a rapidly growing field that has the potential to transform many aspects of society , from healthcare and transportation to finance and education. however, for al to reach its full potential, it requires a robust infrastructure that can support the development and deployment of al systems: currently in cambodia, there is no proper al infrastructure that allows complex development in the field. in this report; we will explore the current state of al infrastructure and discuss some of the key challenges and opportunities in this area generally and in cambodia (sallomi et al., ). al infrastructure refers to the hardware, software, and other resources that are needed to support the development and deployment of al systems (muller, ) . it includes the hardware and software platforms, data storage and management systems, and other tools and resources that are required to build, train, and deploy al models: one of the components of al infrastructure is the hardware on which al algorithms are run in recent years, there has been a significant increase in the availability of specialised hardware for al, such as graphical processing units and tensor processing units. these hardware platforms are designed to be highly efficient at running the complex calculations required by many al algorithms, allowing them to perform faster and more accurately. however, the development of likely key



specialised hardware for al is not without its challenges: one of the key issues is the cost of these platforms, which can be prohibitively expensive for many organisations. in addition, the rapid pace of innovation in the al hardware space means that the hardware used for al today may quickly become outdated: another important component of al infrastructure is the availability of data. al algorithms require large amounts of high-quality data to be trained and tested: the availability of data is therefore a key factor in the development of al systems. however; the collection and curation of high-quality data can be a time-consuming and expensive process. in addition, there are often privacy and ethical concerns surrounding the use of data for al purposes. one potential solution to these challenges is the use of synthetic data, which is data that is generated artificially rather than collected from real-world sources: synthetic data has the advantage of being readily available and controllable, but it can be difficult to ensure that it accurately reflects the real-world conditions that al systems will encounter (dilmegani, ): in addition to hardware and data, al infrastructure also includes the software tools and platforms that are used to develop and deploy al systems there are a wide variety of tools and platforms available, ranging from open-source libraries and frameworks to proprietary software tools. this includes programming languages such as python, and libraries such as tensorfiow, and pytorch, as well as tools for data preprocessing, model training, and model deployment: these tools and platforms can make it easier for developers to build and deploy al systems, but can also introduce their own challenges, such as vendor lock-in and the need for specialised skills. other parts of al infrastructure include the data storage and management systems to store and organise the large datasets that are used to train and test al models  this may include data warehouses, databases, and other storage systems that are designed to handle the scale and complexity of al data: overall, the development of al infrastructure is a complex and rapidly evolving field: for a country like cambodia to participate in this development; it requires a combination of specialised hardware, high-quality data, and powerful software tools and platforms: the challenges and opportunities in this area are numerous, but with continued investment and innovation, al has the potential to transform many aspects of society in the coming years. thus, a robust plan for al investment and implementation might be a worthwhile challenge for cambodia. artificial intelligence (ai) has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of business, from improving decision-making and automation to enabling new products and services. moreover, cambodian businesses are to take full advantage of al solutions: they yet



one keyway al is used in the business is for decision-making and automation: hence, al algorithms can process vast amounts of data and identify patterns and trends that can inform business decisions, allowing organizations to make more accurate and efficient decisions, leading to improved operations and increased profitability. in addition, al is being used to automate many tasks and processes in business for example, ai algorithms can automate customer service, data entry, and other routine tasks, freeing employees to focus on more complex and value-added activities (scheneider , ). this can help to increase productivity and reduce costs. for example, in cambodia, simple machine al for use in industrial factories is being developed by quantum engineering and manufacturing: another area where al is having a significant impact on business is in the development of new products and services. for example, al algorithms create personalized customer experiences, such as product recommendations and content; that can help improve customer satisfaction and loyalty and drive revenue growth: however, the use of al in business has its challenges. one of the key issues is the need for specialized skills and expertise. developing and deploying al algorithms requires a high level of technical knowledge; and many organizations may need help finding the necessary talent: in addition; there are often ethical and privacy concerns surrounding the use of al in business, and organizations must carefully consider these issues: for example, there are already developed equipment and tools that cambodian healthcare centres can acquire and implement: in addition, al can be used in education in cambodia to improve the quality and accessibility of education for example, al algorithms can be used to create personalized learning experiences for students, allowing them to learn at their own pace and in a way tailored to their individual  needs, which can improve student outcomes and increase the efficiency of the education system. another area where al is beginning to have an impact in cambodia is finance. al algorithms are being used to improve financial transactions' accuracy and efficiency and identify potential fraud and money laundering: this can improve the security and reliability of the financial system and help increase access to financial services for individuals and businesses. al is transforming many aspects of business, and its impact will continue to grow in the coming years: as a result; organizations that can effectively adopt and integrate al technologies will likely a competitive advantage. at the same time, those unable to do so may need help to keep pace with the competition. overall, the development and adoption of al in cambodia are still in their early stages, but it can potentially transform many aspects of society. the challenges and opportunities in this area include the need for specialized skills and expertise and the need to address ethical and privacy concerns: nevertheless, with continued investment and development; al has the potential to benetit cambodia in the coming years greatly.  gain key



3_ al revolution: global trends and practical applications in today's data-driven world, the application of al around the world continues to grow exponentially: firms and organisations across all sectors strive to maximise the potential of their data, to make improved decisions for commercial purposes and social impact. from a technical perspective, there exists several forms of al applications such as machine learning, deep learning, hybrid learning, and digital   twins: according to pricewaterhousecoopers (), machine learning can be utilised for 3d mapping of bridge construction based on data from drones, as well as for spotting insider trading: in addition, deep learning is being used to develop customer behavior models: furthermore, hybrid  learning that is based on probabilistic programming in using incomplete information to work with   uncertainty, can be beneficial for analysing market behavior and regulatory environments finally, digital twins that replicate virtually physical and non-physical assets, are ideal for capital project management and helping financial institutions to model individual policyholders, as well as simulate future balance sheets and cash flows: moving onto more practical use cases of al, massachusetts institute of technology sloan "" trends in data and al for  and beyond"" mentions that: "") companies continue bold momentum, ) customer experience analytics take center stage, ) those who leverage external data outperform competitors by double digits, ) chief data officers lead the charge toward a data-driven culture, ) data science loses its luster, and ) data exposes wide gaps in equity and also empowers change' trend ) companies continue bold momentum focuses on the continuous growth of al applications during the covid- pandemic, including the acceleration of cloud migration plans, taking advantage of this disruptive period to challenge the status quo and undergo digital transformation, as well as focusing on the first % of change which is often the most challenging step. trend ) customer experience analytics take center stage highlights the importance of customer-related data to improve customer experience with the help of data fabric and data lakehouse, and analysing different forms of interactions such as voice analytics and customer interaction with chatbots or call centers. trend ) those who leverage external data outperform competitors by double digits emphasises starting with the core business problem, followed by strategising what potential data could be utilised to solve it, in addition to modernising data flows. cindi howson, chief data strategy officer of thoughtspot; shared that the range of data sources has exploded, the only thing lacking here is really your imagination:' trend ) chief data officers (cdos) lead the charge toward a data-driven culture shines a light on the growing significance of cdo roles, in showing companies and employees the efficiency gained with using data, consequently requiring the upskill of workers to take full advantage of new technologies trend ) data science loses its luster discusses the importance of   rebalancing the overemphasis on coding and math, but rather focusing on business application and improving communications skills and data storytelling: trend ) data exposes wide gaps in equity and



empowers change narrows down on the biased data and lack of team diversity building al programs; which in turn; skews the output of al algorithms: in conclusion, the article conveys that al applications should strive for a ""smarter, more fact-driven world, powered by data and analytics"" brown; ). the covid- pandemic has also led to the establishment of a wide range of al applications, in efforts to tackle its resulting challenges. forbes ""the  top artificial intelligence trends for  describes several use cases of al, starting with smarter big data analytics and insights. big data and al applications are being utilised to quickly analyse and interpret data on the spread of the virus around the world, including a natural language processing (nlp) powered search engine to navigate covid- related literature in data sets, as well as machine learning to identify outbreaks with more ease, contact tracing between infected individuals, enabling more accurate diagnoses, predicting virus evolution, and developing more effective lasting vaccinations: in addition, automated detection and prevention is being carried out in the form of drones to detect covid- symptoms such as high temperature of individuals in crowds, in combination with computer vision to analyse camera data. businesses are also utilising data to rebound from the commercial and economic impacts of the pandemic, by predicting behavioral transformation: finally, collaborative al initiatives are being prepared around the world; to shut down the next pandemic before it even starts learning from the past pandemics and the current covid- pandemic, the international exchange of relevant data and best practices will play a major role in preparing for the future (marr, ).  driving al development in cambodia: the power of collaboration generic introduction of the chapter; why is collaboration important? where to start? how to start? what are the challenges for local and global collaboration? what will be the impact of success and failure on building collaboration? collaboration   plays a pivotal role in knowledge   sharing; particularly important for multi- disciplinary/multi-country   research, innovation and development work in many occasions; knowledge sharing occurs through reported articles that are not security-sensitive, do not have intellectual property right (ipr) issues and are not sensitive to financial income. globally , many countries developed strategic agreements to share their knowledge related to security   (for example, the uk with the us) , business and socio-economic growth: data collection, analysis and decision making using al are playing a significant role in this type of knowledge sharing framework the knowledge sharing framework brings various benefits, for example, this saves a significant research or innovation investment for the reinvention of the wheel: the cambodian government and businesses should take initiative to develop similar  regional and global collaboration based on the needs of the socio-economic growth and security of the country: this requires developing a strategic framework for specific data or knowledge to be shared for the 



important sectors: security, innovation and research, crisis and disaster management, cultural understanding; economic growth, health and well-being: failure to build this type of strategic collaborative knowledge   sharing activity will   bring detrimental effects on the sustainable development goals (sdgs) (sustainable development solution network; ) and security (particularly , cybersecurity) of the country: however; the challenges in building collaboration are normally the trust of the stakeholders, barriers for mutual economic benefits and communication/cultural gaps between the   parties. to overcome these challenges, the stakeholders need to communicate and discuss developing a strategic long-term regional and global collaboration framework using data and knowledge sharing infrastructure. .. quadruplel triple helix approach are the stakeholders' engagementlcollaborations important, particularly for a country like cambodia? who will take initiative? how? when? how to prepare a sustainable collaborative framework? what are the key factors that may stimulate applied research and innovation to build collaboration? should we start with quadrupleltriplelboth helix approaches? financing randd policy formulation education innovation incubators government academia spin-off:s support advisory services collaboration entrepreneurial platform venturing legitimatinglink product and industry civfl society competence and service process development development carrying individua and structural perspectives figure . collaborative quadruple helix framework (lindberg et al, ) the stakeholders' engagementlcollaborations are important particularly in a country like cambodia because we need to enhance the development of new knowledge and to transform this knowledge into innovations: cambodia's development challenges include manufacturing;, agriculture, healthcare, transportation, energy, science and technology. the initiative needs to come from the local government as it plays an important role in integrating changes in principles and practices into local development and investment plans: working together to establish   relationships toward a process to generate the outcome of something in common are essential  characteristics that may inspire  applied research and innovation to foster collaboration. because addressing issues requires more than one person,  key why



group, or organisation, collaborative connections are critical; hence, the outcome of collaboration might generate new metrics of success in economic development. collaborative approach includes more than just working together. it refers to the ability to work together and take action on large-scale projects. traditional strategic planning is not a good model for the disciplines that will be required to rebuild our economy. thinking together refers to a series of interactions  involving  academics (the   university) , business, and government  in order to encourage economic and social growth through a triple helix model of innovation. several nations have embraced the triple helix approach to foster innovation through the notion of institutions and policy making: the triple helix interaction pattern is said to be capable of establishing links and interactions between   science and technology, as well as gathering individuals from many disciplines to engage in the process of information exchange; ideas, and thoughts: the quadruple helix paradigm may be regarded as an improvement on the triple helix approach in that it not only focuses on the players from academics, government; and business but also acknowledges society's growing involvement: the framework seeks to bridge the gap between innovation and civil society, claiming that under the triple helix paradigm, new technologies do not necessarily meet societal expectations and requirements, limiting their potential effect: investing more in research, innovation, and entrepreneurship should be at the core of cambodia's development strategy, since it is the only way to achieve smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth. this idea expands on the triple helix model by assuming that society, in addition to academics, business, and government; is a significant actor in innovation processes cambodia may be ideal for creating smart specialisation plans based on the quadruple helix method, which would create an environment conducive to entrepreneurship and innovation; which has been identified as a priority by policymakers and politicians. this is primarily because innovation and entrepreneurship are viewed as means to create new employment while also raising living standards through new and improved products. however, in order for the quadruple helix method to work we need a good leader who can turn knowledge into action. a good leader needs to be good with the group and be able to manage the  multidisciplinarylmulti-countries   collaborative teamwork: how can we   effectively support individuals while simultaneously changing big systems? by follow some of these rules: one conversion at the time, stay focused as design thinking offers an approach for addressing these and other big questions restraint from criticising an idea work with cool ideas and buildable 



work on a time constraint, if not the team will never get anything done mock up combine into a working prototype fail often in order to succeed sooner took the best element out of every prototype and created another workable. lot of hours, be open minded, a leader that is demanding fresh ideas, be quirky and clash with him. belief that chaos can be constructive and teamwork a great deal of teamwork, and these a good recipe for innovation: the team needs to explore the paradox of cross-boundary work and learn about trust dynamics, conflict management; and the advantages and challenges of global teams .. common and inclusive development what are the common issues that may stimulate mutual benefits and opportunities of collaboration? what are the challenges (including the digital divide) for inclusive development? how could we develop a collaborative framework that will help in inclusive development? which stakeholders should contribute to addressing the inclusive issue and in what form a table might help? biasness, inequality and ethical issues related to inclusive development: the common issues that may stimulate mutual benefits and opportunities of collaboration are manufacturing; agriculture, healthcare, transportation, energy, science and technology: the challenges including the digital divide for inclusive development are: skill gap in al at all educational levels this involves revisions at the elementary, secondary, and tertiary levels of education to include al-related courses and programs into school curriculum: it is also necessary to provide chances for instructors to receive training and upskill in order to teach al-related courses: second; numerous policies give specific incentives for large-scale lifelong learning and reskilling via massive open online courses and reskilling: gender inequality in science and technology fields skill shortages are a major impediment to innovation, stifling productivity growth and economic progress. shortages of skilled professionals in areas linked to science, technology, engineering; and mathematics (stem) in particular may limit a society's ability to innovate. over the years, a significant gender disparity has remained at all levels of stem disciplines around the world throughout the world, a significant gender disparity has remained at all levels of stem fields: despite significant gains in women's involvement in higher education; they remain underrepresented in these professions  this issue is particularly serious at the top of academic and professional hierarchies. empirical studies show that countries with a higher proportion of  key key



engineering graduates tend to grow faster than countries with a higher proportion of graduates in other disciplines lack of al policy related to smart governance, smart innovation and smart regulations the absence of information in cambodia refrains academics from furthering their understanding of the problem and policymakers from devising effective remedies this note intends to add to the regional academic and policy discussion by examining the key variables proposed in the literature to explain gender discrepancies in stem recruitment, retention, and promotion, as well as by proposing new factors: ethical, privacy and ipr issues the ethical issues of al applications are growing significantly. this includes data privacy and ipr associated with the data: therefore, a strategic plan is essential to avoid misusing al growth and data associated with that. .3_ global education, research and innovation why is the global collaboration for knowledge sharing through education, research and innovation important? what are types of collaboration to be developed? with which organisationslcountries? how to build these collaborations? what are the funding agencies that may help in stimulating this collaboration? how to develop trainedlskilled manpower to build collaboration hire initially? when to start and where to start? research-informed teaching to accelerate the process national al and data centre for research and development (randd) commercialisation of the outcomes of al research and innovation research, innovation, research-informed teaching and al application development to solve real- world problems are interconnected as shown in figure . it reflects multidisciplinary collaborative teamwork is always to achieve success. al application is a market-driven dynamic area, therefore , requires global collaboration and rapid policy actions to play with the international partners: this also requires   continuously identifying skill gaps in education, research and innovation: based on the gap, there should be a method to train young talent abroad to fill this gap. subsequently, offer an attractive incentive to the trained talent to return to the existing workforce at home. to create this   opportunity, cambodia   needs to develop a strategic collaboration with   regional and global institutions, offer   scholarship based higher  study for  key



talented young people and make an attractive support framework with a national al and data centre as their home. a strategic plan for randd is very important to cope with the al-enabled advancement in the world. the plan should have objectives and a direction of advancements to amplify efficiency. cambodia sees itself thriving significantly in creating world-class research and advancement in some innovation fields: it is obligatory that al is embedded in the randd as well as other divisions to leverage its potential application. based on our investigation, we recommend the following in the strategic plan: need to set up a centre of excellence with leading experts from different backgrounds to work together for al, data and associated technologies collaborative framework (see figure ) with industries, universities, government and young entrepreneurs for applied research and innovation for knowledge transfer regular engagement for knowledge sharing through meetings, seminars and interactive workshops government investment strategy with an appropriate policy framework to promote the job skills of the young people development of research centres in the universities in collaboration with industries and business to promote researchlinnovation informed teaching develop a database of experts in cambodia to promote collaborative activities with government support develop a policy and practices for security, privacy and ethical issues related to the data and ai applications need continuous exploration for potential regional and global research and innovation funds, stafflstudent exchange opportunities and partnership development to exchange knowledge last but not least; develop a strategic framework to attract young people for new skill sets through a public-private partnership finally, cambodia is moving towards a digital economy with new challenges as a middle-income country in . a collaborative framework as shown in figure  with strategic investment and policy is essential to develop skill sets of young people for al applications. as applied research is key to generating knowledge, we need to embed this into the teaching, training and innovation for dynamic technology changes with a focus on sustainable economic growth.

on the micro-level; al can help the market system improve resource allocation and industrial organisation and strengthen firms' competitiveness (phyrom et al,, ). moreover, data and al are said to reduce information asymmetry; which is a form of market failure allowing the market to reach an optimal equilibrium: in terms of labor market structure, opportunities will arise as new kinds of services industries and businesses, namely e-commerce (e.g-, amazon, alibaba, ebay) , e-payment (e.g;, alipay, paypal), and social media (e.g-, facebook, twitter) , will also emerge (phyrom et al, ). and with those come new types of employment: it is predicted by the world economic forum that about  million new jobs will be created by  in several sectors, including artificial intelligence, robotics, immersive technology, green technology, and blockchain (world economic forum; ). in addition, the nature of the employment itself, especially jobs related to software and technology development and multimedia; will be more flexible owing to the fact that now we can collaborate more effectively using an online platform and that workers no longer need to commute to their physical workplace. but at the same time, questions have also been raised about the possible negative impacts of al on patients, especially ethical issues regarding how personal data should be treated: al requires large amount of data which has gradually become a new oil that can be generated endlessly every and such data is handy for many ways and reasons, yet it can pose serious challenges if it falls into the wrong hands or rival countries, and that will compromise national securities along with other dimensions of socio-economic development   considering the current cambodian context   in which   cybersecurity  is limited in infrastructure and human knowledge,  security breaches should be the top priority: it should be highlighted that al still needs data, and al is useless if the data is bad or contaminated by cybercriminals who might use the data to sell in the black market or for scamming purposes because the data is both marketable and profitable. in addition, increasing the use of big data and algorithms or artificial intelligence in general also means an increase in energy use which may hinder cambodia's progress toward goals  and . the latter is about taking action against climate change by regulating coz emissions, improving energy efficiency, and reducing fuel power consumption: even though cambodia has almost achieved universal energy coverage, energy is mostly accessible among the urban population, while the rural population still finds it difficult to gain access to a state-provided electrical power and without stable and sufficient energy; al might not be useful for rural development; particularly in the agriculture and manufacturing industry, further engendering digital division between rural and urban areas. al effects on the reduced inequalities (goal ) is also questionable , for it is still an expensive technology since data is costly to collect; and expertise in developing algorithms is hard to come by even for developed countries, let alone the developing one. as a result; it is only affordable by the richer   countries rather than; the poorer nations, and that will   exacerbate the current  day; grid.



inequalities among countries, for the developed states tend to be the ones who can build exorbitant infrastructure to support al expansion and application, and thus they are able to enjoy more benefits deriving from it: in the case of an individual country such as cambodia; al technology is likely to be able to afford only by the rich or major corporations, which tends to increase income inequality. although al might help boost productivity, the benefits might not really go towards the poor, creating an obvious two highly divided segments in a single society and thereby social issues: it is suggested that a strong mechanism such as a progressive tax to counter the byproduct or externality of al should be in placed first: on top of that; artificial intelligence is likely to place blue-collar workers on the brink of job loss and subsequently increase inequalities within a nation (brynjolfsson and mcafee, ). it is worth noting that workers need to have decent skills to operate industry . technology which tends to reward educated individuals handsomely yet at the same time heavily punish low-skilled workers who conventionally come from a disadvantaged background: this partially helps explain why there has been an increase in the wage gap between college and high school graduates in the united states: additionally, more automation is translated into less human labor. hence, al is likely to reduce demand for but increase the supply of manual workers, decrease their wages, and eventually transfer more wealth from workers to firm owners: in cambodia; such a structural change in the economy can be detrimental considering that the vast majority of workers in the manufacturing industries, including the garment sector, are liow-skilled young adults who are unlikely to utilise al technology and hence prone to job displacement: it is explicable that there is always a tradeoff between efficiency and equity, but there must be more winners than losers. and the losers should be compensated fairly. in this regard, a process to do so must be considered first before implementing al technology to ensure that national technology advancement policies are not there only to enrich firms and employers; otherwise, al-led economic development will lead to even more social challenges. simply put; it does more harm than good to society. with that said, a valid question should be asked: is cambodia ready? cambodia's commitment to  responsible innovation and   research ethics   provides a solid foundation for integrating al ethics into its sti policy: by balancing scientific progress with ethical considerations, cambodia fosters integrity and social responsibility: upholding human security, addressing bias and discrimination, and promoting transparency and accountability are aspects of al ethics that cambodia towards a future where al benefits society while safeguarding its values: .. skilling and re-skilling the workforce in cambodia technology has been changing the nature of the workforce in all sectors, from small and medium- sized enterprises (smes) to big industry, which lead the trends of the new jobs require the 21st century skills (world bank group, ). it is expected that by , nearly  million new jobs  key guide



will be created by using digital technology (world economic forum; ). emerging technologies such as cloud computing, big data, cyber security, immersive technology, game, al, cobotics, internet of things   (lots) , block-chain and 3d printing are likely to adopted by industries, businesses, health and well-being, agriculture and education in the future. it is reported that at least % of the tasks (% of current occupations) are at high risk, and % of the jobs the next generation will do in  do not exist (rethy et al,, ). it is well recognised that there are no ways to tackle the 4th industrial revolution, especially job-loss issues without skilling and re-skilling the al workforce: in this regard, it is very crucial for government and stakeholders to prepare the digital skill sets for the future labour force. according to van laar et al: in , the 21st century digital skills are technical knowledge, information finding creativity and   innovation, critical   thinking, reasoning and complex   problem solving, and interpersonal skills such as communication, collaboration, negotiation and teamwork  with the industrial revolution ., countries around the world, as well as cambodia have developed their own strategies and policies related to al. stem education policy was proposed to encourage students to go for stem majors after their graduating from high school whereas technical and vocational education and training (tvet) policy and -year cambodia digital economy and society policy framework were to promote technical and technology skill development (ratha and phirom; ). similarly; to make the existing workforce survive and make it ready for those entering the workplace, the cambodia's sti roadmap  and policy focus on improving human capita in science and technology, especially al in both quantity and quality, and gender equity. the current highly skilled workforce in cambodia is still in low number which necessitate an education system reform to prepare in building modern skillsets for the future (world bank group; ) . from the employer perspective, as shown in figure 3_ skills in cambodia (bruni et al:_ ) , the most major skill gap is foreign language skills, and practical skills (bruni et al._ ). in reskilling and upskilling for the human resource of the 21st century, all education levels need to adapt to al education curriculum which al and digital literacy should have been introduced to our young people since their early age of study. building up strong background for students in math; english , critical thinking; art, design, animation and coding is crucial in making pathway for them to step foot into the future modern skills (hor and hesketh; ). in addition to the education reform, to strengthen the future skill sets, it is requiring the participants from all the stakeholders such as governments, universities, industries and societies. to ensure the workforces are ready to meet the future demands of the domestic and foreign labour market; government should give priority to innovative research, stem education, creativity, and critical thinking skills. apart from al and  digital   knowledge, emotional intelligent skills such as working as a team and communicating with other people are significant for the company well performing, productivity increment; and collaborating with outsiders_  yet ability , gap

three significant challenges that will be needed to exploit full potential of al applications: data collection and accessibility, inter-disciplinary knowledge sharing framework, and shortage of talent who can improve al capabilities, stimulate new ideas, and implement solutions to address the challenges, cambodia can develop the following strategic pillars of al: i) centre of excellence for applied research, innovation, training; and implementation, ii) skilling and reskilling of al and associated workforce with local and global institutional supports, ii) data, knowledge sharing framework and digital infrastructure, iv) gdpr, ethics, data privacy, security, v) funding support for accelerating al start-ups, research and  innovations, and vi)  industrialisation/commercialisationldeployment of the al- enabled technologies. table 1_ technology field needed by sectors (hor and hesketh, ) al data immersive cyber block 3d sectors lots game robotics algorithms analysis technology securitylchain |printing education x industry x x x aeaculture   x| h x x |  business x x the points to setup a roadmap are as follows: research, innovation and development capacity building of national human resources targeting a country of innovators promotion of a culture of adopting advanced technologies and al empower and enable industries for human-machine collaboration to boost incomes and employment dynamic scaling-up for new skilling and align resources with imaginative types of reskilling to prepare representatives at all domains to work with al-enabled solutions. .. data privacy, ethic, security and regulations while al promises a positive net   benefit   for  society and economy, it also poses a great responsibility and risk when it comes to privacy, ethics, and security. as one may define al, it is machine brain that accumulates learnings from data to create intelligence rather than rules explicitly codified by human programmers to perform tasks automatically: the key here is that the decision is increasingly being made by machine rather than human as it is enabled by data; computing resources, and advanced algorithms. decisions made by al could have consequences that affect fundamental rights and human beings. the question is to what extent al decisions can be trustworthy, ethical and conformed to intrinsic human fundamental rights and values?  key



overview of the data protection and regulation in cambodia cambodia has not yet enacted any comprehensive data protection legislation. the first to the country's data protection landscape has come in the form of the e-commerce law (only available in khmer) , which contains provisions for the protection of consumer data that has been gathered over the course of   electronic   communication: the e-commerce law is thereby restricted in scope to virtual andlor digital data protection. currently only few laws and regulations that express privacy and data protection include the constitution, civil code, laws on telecommunications and the press laws. ministry of interior lawyers and data specialists chaired a meeting to discuss the first draft of a sub-degree on the management; use, privacy safeguard and security of data the governments have collected that can potentially be used to identify individuals on january , . on january , specialists from the ministry's legislation council and heads of the ministry's general directorates and departments discussed an initial draft comprising six chapters and  articles: the purpose of this sub-decree was to determine rules for the management, use and privacy protections for identifying data that would serve public interests, promote service provision quality and develop the nation in a highly efficient and secure manner: data protection and regulation vision cambodia seeks to harmonise among the existing laws and  rights mentioned earlier   for standardisation into a more targeted and specific data protection laws that governs sensitive personal data and its security needs across its lifespans in capture, storage, sharing; use, and archive. cambodia desires to balance risks and create conditions for a trustworthy al sector to grow in a healthy, responsible and safe manner with initiatives to establish a national ethical framework committee body and data   regulation laws conformed to the regional and international standards: that way, principles and practices for unbiased use of al are formed to promote fairness, ethics, inclusivity, transparency, and accountability so that citizens and businesses can adopt the use of al in a protected and safe manner: cambodia recognises risks of heavy regulation seeing regulation may be too strict because it forfeit foreign investment in the technology sector; especially so in a small country like cambodia without sufficiently qualified human resources and technological advancement to manage data centres and security at the scale big tech firms are capable of. cambodia and its citizens have to answer this question as we move into the digital economy: why would large digital technology and manufacturing firms rather invest in cambodia and not in   singapore or   vietnam? what competitive advantage and drivers do we exhibit relative to neighboring countries in attracting and  update may



retaining foreign investment? with an understanding that regulation in nature tends to de- motivate innovation and slow down growth in exchange for a safer and fairer society as regulation increases compliance responsibility and constrains business behaviors to a set of social, ethical, and legal norms especially if poorly designed and implemented. heavy regulation will likely hurt local digital businesses who emerge to cultivate innovation and experimentation to create new business lines and stimulate growth because they may not prepare to take administrative and compliant burdens; while a lack of regulatory clarity injects fears of heavy fines that could destroy business startup and survival: having said that; it is in the nation's interest to establish data protection laws to manage harms while providing regulatory clarity to guide businesses in ways of handing user data and consent;, particularly user identifiable information such as name, date of birth, identity, and any other data objects that could reveal an individual identity. importantly, the world has increased the level of sophistication in digitalisation that captures and processes data across multiple jurisdictions so data protection laws to provide regulatory clarity for cross-border data management and cloud technology adoption guidelines will be established. because unlawful and iil intention usage of these data   especially by bad actors cause harm to users, and therefore subject to legal responsibilities; penalty and fines. in this effort, cambodia looks to legislate data protection laws to make businesses and service providers accountable to the management, collection and usage of data in a responsible manner and nurture al fields for maximum benefits with respect to foundational elements of human rights while promoting adoption for economic gains. data privacy and ethics article  of the universal declaration of human rights treats privacy as a distinct human right. stated one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence. everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks_ in the cambodian laws, it mentioned that citizens have rights to privacy: definitive meanings to what privacy are remains ambiguous and subject to legal interpretation. however, data privacy often refers to the rights to be left alone and rights to be free of independent thoughts: even so, privacy is a broad term that is essential to human dignity and autonomy for individual freedom: yet when conflicted with other laws, rights to privacy may be restricted under certain conditions like to protect national security and public safety. for example, in the matter of criminal offenses to protect public safety the state may authorise and require persons or entities to reveal one's individual identity without the needs of the user's consent who is under suspicion. in this regard to the privacy needs of citizens,  cambodia looks to establish a guideline to encourage organisations of all sizes to adopt privacy-by-design approach to developing al applications while the establishment of the national committee of ethics will champion the guidelines and direction for the incorporation of ethics and privacy for al. given how early-stage  along ""no



al is in cambodia and for many organisations of all sizes, it may be impractical to copy and paste regulation requirements from the likes of european union's general data protection regulation (gdpr): a customised and localised standard data privacy and protection laws will be likely to align with the asean regions. basic elements like the collection of personal data shall have user consent and provide purpose information to such usages that protect user privacy and security. individuals shall have rights to request, access, update, and remove at its user cost. cambodia sees al development conform to the ethical framework and social norms to ensure human values are protected, inclusion is encouraged, and fairness is   preserved without systematic discrimination against   humanity that causes perceptual bias and harms: the discrimination may be classified into a category of race, gender, physical ability, and economic background. right protection to equitable, just and fair treatment in society is a fundamental responsibility of the state when it comes to inter-relation conflicts among individuals, businesses and government agents. however, it is the responsibilities of the organisations andlor goods and service providers that create al applications and mismanage user data that affects one' ethical values: decisions made by al applications that affect society's fundamental and ethical values shall be thought out by design and undergo a standard user and system acceptance test aimed at ensuring a trustworthy al. critical decisions whether in health, credit loan, insurance claim, and employment shall provide reasonable explanations to support why such decisions are being made. when in doubt, humans should be in the loop to ensure al decisions behave as expected and trusted: and al decisions are ethically sound and have a base of ethical foundation aligned to cambodian constitutions and ethical framework data security data security is the process of safeguarding data against unauthorised access and corruption throughout its lifespan from data collection, sharing; usage, and deletion. with the growing risks of attacks and intrusion, organisations adopting al at any scale shall invest to build cybersecurity capability in human resource and security technologies to govern, protect and manage its data assets: data security methods such as data  encryption, hashing, and tokenisation are essential to the way data is safeguard and protected across all applications and platforms: because management of user data is ultimately the responsibility of good and service providers, security governance and checks shall be in place to protect user information from cyber security attack, leaks, scams, fraud, and loss. risks of cyberthreats shall be studied, assessed and minimised at the organisation disposal. the intended or unintended consequences of poor management of data may cause various harms to users so corporate organisations who handle large personal data especially related to personal finance and health shall be accountable and able to demonstrate compliance reporting: the organisation shall have at least a minimum of one in charge of creating and mandating its data policy , security, and governance.  cyber key person



in general, cambodia desires to establish data   protection laws and guidelines to provide regulatory clarity for all data processes across its life spans and to protect users with regards to data privacy and ethics. service providers shall adapt to a human rights by-design approach to minimise unintentional or hidden biases, any discrimination or other negative consequences on individuals with respect to human rights and basic freedoms. the government of cambodia aims to design a well-informed regulatory framework consisting of best practices in the growing subject of trustworthy al, while emphasising the need of using al in a fair, transparent; accountable, and responsible manner. .. strategic investment for al-powered cambodia after a series of up, down and side turns, the development of al technology has made great progress globally emerging from research labs into more socially useful and commercially viable technology applications that present massive opportunities for a modern economy and society. some refers to al impact and disruption from the change and technological innovation to the early days' invention of electricity, steam and water as well as the automobiles, computers and the internet today: with billions of dollars expected to generate from al globally, cambodia sees the need and urgency to invest; adopt and prepare for this al global force in line with industry . trend as the economy increasingly becomes knowledge and digital based. a strategic investment in the field of al introduces three major pillars to maximise benefits and minimise risks in the facilitation of al development for nation-wide adoption, safety and sustainability: invest in people building the nation capacity for a resilient workforce, growth and innovation invest in technological infrastructure building a robust foundation invest in a collaborative tech ecosystem building a sustained network of value providers. these strategic views aim to drive cambodia's competitiveness in the region and attract foreign investment: as a small, growing nation rising from ashes, cambodia is not in a position seeking to be a leader of al in most domains but to strengthen its emerging role to contribute to the global economy as a hub for applied al with young people talents to rapidly and innovatively prototype solutions to solve state-level, societal and economic problems. an investment in human capital, digital infrastructure, and ecosystem development help cambodia maximise at every stage of development and adoption, while randd in niched areas are encouraged to be innovative and pioneering: the investment in randd also prevents critical adoption barriers and accelerates the use of al for economic and societal benefits: for example, without investing in the core khmer nlp cambodia cannot maximise its benefits from al applications like  yet gains



conversational chatbot using khmer and any others that build on top of nlp requiring the native language. cambodia also aims to establish a data protection regulation to provide regulatory clarity and ensure accountability for a trust worth al to flourish responsibly that is in line with asean and international data protection laws as well as conforms to the established social norms within an ethical framework with respect to human rights. ... invest in people building the nation capacity for a resilient workforce, growth and innovation this is in line with section .. skilling and re-skilling the workforce and the rectangular strategy iv from the government of cambodia. it looks to refine its positioning and competitiveness in the regional play: needless to say, al will disrupt and impact labor employment categories, which require strategic initiatives to facilitate labor mobility, rapid skills building and upgrading; skills transfers, and access to information. one of the greatest assets cambodia has is its tech-savvy young population, where almost two-third of the population is under  years old. more and more young people are equipped with english speaking ability which will serve the needs of digital knowledge workers in the new era and in the asean economic integration for labour mobility and interaction: by leveraging the rising young; talented individuals and tech startup entrepreneurs to build phnom penh digital hub for innovative applications, technology and data talents, cambodia is prepared in human resource development to achieve higher middle-income status by . people capability development is not only to build a home-grown young workforce sufficient to supply the country's economy but also the regional and international economy: a number of factors are considerations when it comes to al talent development: ... mindset and literacy the government of cambodia recognises building capacity for the labor workforce is a long-run effort: change management starts with mindset themselves, their family and institutions. the government aims to raise awareness and educate the population about the potential uses of al, benefits, and its risks  this introduction aims at raising the national average level of digital literacy around basic technology usage so all segments of citizens including disable persons, lower-income group, female and elder can reap full benefits and not be digitally excluded: as al becomes more prevalent, relationships between humans and machines will also need to develop and strengthen for a safe, knowledgeable, and growing society. digital literacy programs around al and stem education will be campaigned and promoted targeting ) the general population ) parents for their confidence in job prospects of their kids' decision to enter stem education ) youths themselves to be aware and access information as they make informed educational decisions: the government will also look into policy design for promoting the demand side for al and digital talents to power their institutions in both private and public sector such as tax credits for workforce training, and in particular act as the public-private collaboration and protection  key any



enabler to increase private sectors' incentives for maximum impact and reduce frictional risks for a striving digital economy. all initiatives will be to ensure digital mindset; literacy, and attitude toward al are well received and cover both the supply and demand side when it comes to human resource planning and development. ... stem graduates strong and growing economy highly correlates with stem education as it serves to build labor forces to fill needs from the private and public sector: more importantly, with the applications of al, stem workers will need to think,; build, operate, and maintain al. critical preconditions like this for the al sector to flourish in cambodia will be explored, assessed and acted upon to build a robust local  talent pool in the field and overtime change the  dynamic of  foreign talent dependencies. cambodia has made and continues to level up its effort to increase the number of stem graduates per year working with the ministry of education, youth and sport and in building early age interests of children toward stem education, ensuring a sizable enrollment and minimal drop out in universities across city and provinces later on: with the recognition of the needs for practical lab and applied studies, cambodia aims to foster and promote public-private partnerships such as employers and education institutions to establish internship standards that mutually benefit both the students and organisations. this effort is intended to establish educational and employment iinks and create more chances of success, for example with government sponsored local and international internship programs in the stem areas which will be shared, promoted and standardised. sending students abroad for stem internships will give them practical experience and exposure to the international work environment and standards while keeping brain drain in-check collectively; it drives international competitiveness for employment opportunities when it comes to quality talents for local and international employers. along with productivity gains expected for the economy with stem graduates, their income is also expected to rise drastically into a new income bracket thus leveling up a multi-generational, socio-economic impact to them, families and society: ... tvet graduates beyond a stem degree program, a new tvet education focusing on ict are welcomed and promoted to complement university degree standards. companies expect graduates to come with soft and technical skills that reflect the changing nature of industry and technology so require a rapidly evolving and regularly updated curriculum for quality teaching and practical excellence. a number of classroom-to-career institutions will be promoted to provide short-term, high skills, industry-relevant technology training to meet the rapid needs from private sector organisations and smes cambodia aims to support these specific skills development programs especially in 



the digital and technology fields such as but not limited to computer training, al, software engineering, blockchain, robotics, data science, computer programming, and security: ... life-long learning for upskill and re-skill workforce in addition to these above education standards, cambodia looks to develop life-long learning opportunities in its efforts to upskill and re-skill both private and public sector staff. cambodia intends to explore e-skill credits where individuals can apply and use the credits with third-party providers to receive the training; developing their resilient adaptation to the inevitable force of automation and preparing for new job category creation by ai. overall the life-long learning initiatives will increase citizen professional growth opportunities for better employment and higher income while boosting the nation's productivity. the impact of job loss and creation due to al will be carefully studied in the context of cambodia and plan initiatives for rapid upskill and reskilling implementation programs working with key multi-stakeholders including international development  organisations  and training  providers. cambodia has witnessed the impact  of covid19 pandemic that destroyed by-and-large the tourism sector that the economy has largely depended on. this major source of income powering the economy has been depleted with great uncertainty moving into the post-covid era: garment  manufacturing sector, which has also significantly contributed to cambodia's gdp, is another area greatly vulnerable to the global development of al, high-tech investment and automation: it is a national concern that has been shared among ministries and development partners: having said that; cambodia works proactively to take calculated risks, minimise the expected damage, and cultivate opportunities that al will create such as through the upskill and re-skill efforts to ensure a positive net impact from ai: ... invest in technological infrastructure building for a robust foundation digital infrastructure is the backbone of a thriving economy for the internet era: a strong digital foundation is essential to maximise the benefits at scale with minimal security risks for vibrant and safe technological development in society: ... connectivity and telecommunication cambodia enjoys a high mobile and broadband penetration rate telecommunication services are provided with national-wide network coverage at affordable prices for customers--partly thanks to a regulatory environment that fosters market competition among mobile operators. advancement in telecommunication technology such as the introduction of 5g infrastructure and fast-speed fiber optic will also further increase the nation's connectivity. while a high penetration rate of mobile phones and connectivity coverage is well acknowledged, cambodia government will continue a regulatory environment that promotes investments to better telecommunications  cyber key



networks and services that support al research, applications and usage. particularly it aims to boost connectivity infrastructure further and promote public-private partnerships among hardware manufacturers, internet service providers and interested economic actors to increase household access and affordability for available hardware devices and fast-speed, high quality internet connection thus increasing citizen   participation in the digital economy and reap potential benefits: ... digital and data infrastructure in line with the .. data and digital infrastructure section, strategic investment into building a robust data and digital infrastructure ensures cambodia facilitates the development of the al sector. al randd requires storage and computing resources to be utilised in a collaborative, safe and secure manner. cambodia will support the digital infrastructure architecture with high- performance physical servers and software in preparation for the country's ambition toward a digital economy and create a digital sandbox for innovation and collaboration among private sectors and research institutions to prototype solutions to societal and commercial applications of ai. cambodia aims to develop a national data center facility to manage computing, data storage and network services to ensure smooth operation. initiatives will also be taken around boosting the quality and access of the high-performant internet, computer network, security system, data center, social media, software, mobile and web applications: ... invest in the emerging technologies cambodia government embraces digital technologies as we ve seen in the industry . agenda for e-government adoption at the state-level because it believes icts enable innovation for the country and not stifle it. the gap between the current pace of global technological development and adoption ability in cambodia is increasingly widened for many areas; only a few niches where we are noticeably recognised as early adopters these niches can be said for the case of the bakong blockchain-based technology system by the national bank of cambodia as among the first central banks in the world to deploy such revolutionary tech. the technology facilitates the settlement among financial institutions and lowers the cost of inter-cooperation for all end-users thus increasing financial access and inclusion. another case can be said for the id-poor on- demand  digital  system and graph database by the ministry of planning working with development partners such as deutsche gesellschaft fur internationale zusammenarbeit gmbh and australian aid to better social registry and social protection with targeted assistance provision to the right poor households these technologies are newly adopted in cambodia and have not been done at the same scope or scale before but have shown great promise, feasibility and nation-level impact; thus for the digital ambition that cambodia strives to achieve will require investment into testing newly  emerged   technologies,  fostering a culture of trial-and-error experimentation with more collaborative randd institutions, and building a know-how absorptive  any key



ability for the nation to scale up the implementation efforts. some examples of these emerging technologies include distributed big data storage with hadoop/spark for a single source of identity information; decentralised   applications with blockchain around ownership rights and data traceability with a security standard, internet of things such as drones and robotics to better agricultural output, digital platforms for e-services to increase citizen and business participation, cloud computing integration technologies with regulatory clarity and feasibility assessment to enable business organisations' accessibility for the world's powerful technological infrastructure and platforms to increase their productivity output per unit cost of production: ... invest in a collaborative tech ecosystem building an ecosystem for a sustained network of value providers cambodia has the opportunity to achieve economic, security, and social gains in the al sector for many domains: yet it lacks key enabled and supported areas. for example, for e-commerce to function in the economy, which has taken a long time until it is being adopted more widely now in its growth acceleration partly thanks to the e-commerce law enacted in , it requires not only the digital marketplace for buyers and sellers, but also logistics, digital payment; and customer protection that facilitates it. it is nearly impossible for any individual business to build every aspect at the same time thus relying on an ecosystem of various economic actors in the provision of products and services. the cambodian government has made big steps and is committed to promote a robust collaborative ecosystem to increase overall benefits and reduce collaboration cost for the ecosystem actors one area is in the promotion of a vibrant startup ecosystem and tech hub supported by a local and international collaboration: for example, the co-investment initiatives with private institutional investors increases access to finance for startup and sme entrepreneurs with khmer enterprise's entrepreneurship fund by the ministry of economic and finance. it also brings a well-known global vc (startup ) through its international collaboration and local corporations' partners to nurture the startup ecosystem: tech entrepreneurship is demonstrated as a career path option which is actively promoted in addition to stem workers: cambodia encourages economic activities and initiatives that drive the next generation of digital businesses and startups that use digital and al technologies through national award, grants, and investment. .. research and innovation this section explores the state of the art of research landscape in cambodia about al. more importantly, the innovative aspect of the knowledge from al research will be discussed in the context: at this point; it is important to root the term ""innovation"" viewed by charpie in  . he emphasised that innovation is made if five steps are made; which includes basic invention from ideas (ideation) , engineering design (micro piloting) , manufacturing (industrial scale) , 



manufacturing startup (making a startup), and market diffusion (generating profit) . al will be ubiquitous in our daily life in next decade, especially in decision making process, improving workflow and efficiency, health care, education, and financial sector: for instance, it is suggested that al capacity will surely add value to the efficiency and accuracy of clinicians (thomas et al,, ). data will be the driving for al development: internet users are the main contributor of data for al. the materialisation of al stock of al knowledge for economic purposes is an innovation approach. contextually , cambodia requires strategic investment in the field if the kingdom wishes to unleash the potential of al for socio-economic development: some important investment could be financing, infrastructure development; talent development; and   supportive regulatory framework three types of data are being collected for al, which are identity data, network data, and behavior data (ma; ). identity data refers to data of individual, entity, or identity or information characteristic to identify a person or institution. network data refers to data of location from direct input to any application or usage of any particular application. behavior data refers to data that users browse in websites, social media, apps or in other application interfaces the three data are the important resources for al. a triple helix model of market driven research on al could be reiterated most of the discussion: the world is facing the rapid accumulation of knowledge on al, while   private sector is harnessing the   potential of the field: however; consequences and various potential risks arising from this development has posed a great attention among policy makers and academic researchers, while private sector is in concern stage to materialise the development: likewise, cambodia is experiencing the rapid development of al in the last decades_ the pool of knowledge in the field is growing fast in way that is unpredictable from user perspective. practically, academia is seen to have challenges in coping with the demand of private sectors in the field. this rapid development and application of the field in industrylservices results in great attentions as well to policy makers government regulator has generally acknowledged the significance of al in economic development;, but privacy, security, ethics, and value are the major concern: after all it is necessary that al landscape in cambodia could be well understood prior to incentivise or regulate the development of the domain: ... scholarly publication from academic point of view cambodia has seen the importance of investment in al development. some nascent publication of al by cambodian scholars seems to be since . for instance, the first algorithm on swarm intelligence published (hul et al,, 2007a; hul et al,, 2007b; seingheng et al.,; tan et al., ). the work was published focusing mainly on water reuselrecycle in industrial sector: however, it seems no much progress in scholarly work; despite that the work 



has great attentional in the later stage. supper power economic drive like china, european union, and united states has started to invest drastically in the research and development of al from that time. the number of peer-reviewed paper and patents on al has increased significantly in the last decade. most of the papers are coming from higher education institutions the number of al publication including journal articles, conference papers, repositories, patents, book chapters, book; thesis, and others are show below. the number of al publication is seen more than two folds in the last ten years: the report by center for security and emerging technology in  appears that journal papers share .%  of all al scholar documents   published: pattern recognition contributed more than other fields of machine learning, computer vision, algorithm, data  mining; natural language processing, human computer interaction, control theory, and linguistics.  .         l               figure . al publication trends in the last ten years (center for security and emerging technology, ) al publication by sector shows that education predominate in the last ten years, while china shares largest number of publication and citation about al. the huge contribution of al knowledge from china could be attributed to large amount of data from users and the government policy to support the al development in the country: in addition, hundreds of companies are opening up on al investment. 



.%, education %  %  % j % .%, unknown ., nonprofit % ., company .%, government             figure . publication by sectors in the last ten years (center for security and emerging technology, ) trends has commonly understood that al-driven technologies are expected to be the stimulus for economic growth. likewise, cambodia values the importance of al application as well. however; adoption, implementation and incentivised system are not sufficient enough  from academic studies in cambodia society (s. heng et al,, ). scholars put an importance debate on value of al on economic development. some suggested that al-enabled technologies for economic development in emerging growth nations could not simply happen until there is proper ecosystem. the foundation to adopt and adapt al technologies for   developing economy   could be scientificlengineering-based education, sufficient infrastructure, favorable technology transfer mechanism; and others (sayogo et al,, ). further investment on al-enabled technologies in education sector was also suggested (p. ). one of the first academic events was conducted entitled st annual forum on al: human intelligence in augmented era' with the aim to promote the field and its application. the event was arranged by institute of technology of cambodia and cambodia development resource institute. then; the forum was not made possible due to disruption of covid-. finally, this important event was continued to commence again entitled ""2nd annual forum: al for society"" on august ,  at cambodia university of technology and  science in collaboration with  ministry of industry, science, technology innovation: this forum is organised to academia; private sectors, government, civil societies, and other relevant stakeholders to discuss the current development of al, its future trends, and opportunities and challenges up ahead that cambodia should prepare itself for if it decides to fully embrace such technology: the forum has five main objectives: provide a platform for the representatives from the government;  industries and academia to discuss; express, and exchange ideas on the al landscape and its impacts on society  heng; bring



raise public awareness of the significance , opportunities; benefits and challenges of al applications formulate policy suggestions and recommendations for promoting and strengthening the development of industry . technologies in general, al in particular promote multi-stakeholder collaboration for knowledge mobilisation and development of artificial intelligence in cambodia disseminate the results of research studies on artificial intelligence landscape in cambodia: ... al demand the application of al is necessarily incorporated in industry and related public services. there is a need in synergising efforts from all stakeholders. an investment in al for research universities is important: on the other hand, the private sector and public institutions could bring actual al- enabled  technologies to fit the demand for research universities: research and innovation ecosystem of al in the countries could be suggested as fellow (s. et al., ). university level: required motived and qualified researchers on al, intra and inter collaboration among researchers and institutions, lessening redundancy work, joint research efforts private sector level: setting up task force, using case-driven approaches, solution- driven adoption process government level: required funding for research and development, clear approaches and strategy, centralisation of the al activities: coordinating underlies foundation the al research and development: existing policy such as national policy on sti -, cambodia's sti roadmap , cambodia digital economy and society policy framework -, could be some of legal instruments to unleash the potential of al for useful purposes. breaking the silo among all stakeholders is the immediate actions to ensure that al ecosystem is connected for socio-economic development of the nation national council of science, technology and innovation is the big umbrella serving as platform to accommodate stakeholders: .. potential al applications for different sectors ... service over the last few decades, the number of internet users increase rapidly over the world wide web. in the current era of internet; large amount of data has been generated every day whenever you are watching tv, using social media, doing online shopping and communication: as the speed of internet access is getting incredibly faster from end-to-end users; the new advance technologies  heng



such as lots, big data analytics, al, have been possibly introduced to better benefit the human life. due to this reason, numerous of companies seek to adopt these advance technologies to create more creative services from day to day to their end user. this process could be possible by collecting and analysing the data generated from the past experience of their customers and, thus, it could deliver the related services according to their interests and needs: let's take a look on how the al technology has the impact on everyday life as following: a retail and e-commerce with the development of the e-commerce, the scale of online retail is becoming larger and larger: within the variety of product categories and changeable customer demand, it is a very big challenge for the sale  volume   prediction: in the modern al is   applied to tackle the aforementioned problems: chen in  proposed an online retail prediction using machine learning called aga-lstm neural network. the adaptive genetic algorithm is applied while the building of neural network to optimised the training time and prediction accuracy. as a result, the method could forecast the sale volume of goods in a very large and complicated e-commerce. b_ online advertising in the world of the digital marketing, many companies try to improve their business strategy by promoting and   diversifying their  products and  services via many methods and one of the promising one is online advertising: the problem is how does the company actually know about which ads the customer is interested in. in fact; al is already there to solve this problem. normally , most of the website have implemented the tracking code to keep log file of browsing behavior of individual (neumann, ). this information is shared across different companies and, thus, the historic behavior about the user interest of which site you visit or which product you looked at were being captured. during this process, al is used to match the users to the corresponding ads based on the analysing of this historic behavior: c customer support customer support is the very effective way used in any company to help the customer when thing goes wrong eg-, when user want to know detail about the way the use the product properly, would call and ask  traditionally, most companies spend a lot of moneys to create customer service department as the prompt and accurate response to a request is very essential for customer retention and satisfaction (molino et al,, ). yet; this procedure could lead to change of worker practices as the users expect to ask for time availability of the information about their orders or to answer a very simple questions such as ""why is my internet connection dead"" (hardalov et al,, ). many of al application have been proposed such as voice recognition , sentimental analysis (kaur, ), etc, in order to understand the customer's question and give  day, they



the accurate response e.g , nowadays, people are most likely to use alexa, siri or google assistance for online shopping; controlling home devices etc. ... manufacturing manufacturing sector has played an important role for the country by contributing to employment growth, national security, sustainable development which improve the economic potential and gdp of the country: with the emerging technologies such as inter-communication (lot, cps), smart visualisation and decision making (al, big data, cloud computing) and cyber security it has enabled the transformation of the manufacturing in terms of the model; approach and its ecosystem. the life cycle of manufacturing in the new era requires a lot of processes and technologies. generally, the procedure uses the autonomous sensing; inter-connection, decision- making, control, and the execution of human; machine, material, and environment information to integrate and optimise various aspects of manufacturing: therefore, it would help to facilitate the production and to produce high efficiency and quality , cost-effective, environment friendly for users, and to improve the competitiveness in the manufacturing market. in addition (qu et al., ) , the evolution of smart manufacturing is not only to develop new technology, but one must also define the requirements of stakeholders and the model of innovative business. technically, this process would help get real-time data to improve the accuracy of decision-making in the supply process (mass customisation) , enhance the efficiency and performance of the production line process (plant automation) , minimise the used resources (raw material) , waste management and increase the overall productivity. al, which is computer system able to perform task that generally mimic to the human intelligence, is one of the main key drivers in this change as it would help in forwarding the sustainable development (buchmeister et al., ). thus, al is a very important factor to transform the traditional manufacturing into advance and smart manufacturing in the context of fourth industrial revolution. a_ smart warehouse management system traditionally; warehouse is used to store the manufactured products from one or many places and deliver them to the company customer. due to the rapid increasing amounts of orders in the modern day, the distribution process in the warehouse is getting more complicated and led to the birth of the smart warehouse management system. according to study there are five main steps in the complete product distribution process which consists in planning, receiving and put away, location management, order picking and packing, and transport and tracking: by introducing al concept, each step can be analysed and optimised separately (zunic et al,, ). study by pulungan et al. in  provides some brief discussions on the practical implementation of artificial intelligent into warehouse management system. the research mentioned on to use new technologies such as bee colony optimisation, fussy controlling, extreme learning machine along the radio frequency identification. all of the aforementioned technologies are used to  flow how



enable the intelligent logistic  system, intelligent warehouse   system, real-time   transportation monitoring system, sales forecasting system and intelligent sales summary system (pulungan et al., ). b_ manufacturing production since the beginning of the industrial revolution . (i4.) , many countries have already address it as modern challenge in various fields   especially in the  advance industrial  manufacturing (kagermann et al, ). this transformation of advanced industrial manufacturing could be made through digitalisation and exploitation of new advanced technology such as self-learning and self-adapting cyber physical system (cps) , lots, cloud computing and al. their primary goal is to address the need of modern production system with higher  efficiency and lower cost throughout the process so that it could meet new demand in the modern market: to tackle the problems, numerous of enterprises have already investigated and implemented by using all of these aforementioned technologies. to be competitive under the paradigm of |., a company must production planning and control (ppc) able to respond to disturbance (cadavid et al,, ). normally, ppc can be defined as the required quantity in the plant production to meet profitability, productivity and on-time delivery: to satisfy the requirement; the author introduce the al technology by using text mining to estimate the production inhibition time and machine learning techniques to create the dynamic production schedule in the production line. on the other hand, the aim of smart manufacturing is to achieve highly flexible and automate in the production process (hsieh et al,, ). the use case of the paper is to detect the anomaly of production line in smart manufacturing by using the collected data from the sensing device: they introduce a new al algorithm called unsupervised real-time anomaly detection based on lstm-based auto- encoder . ... mobility and transportation mobility and transportation are known as the backbones of the modern economy and function in one country to become intelligent: they are a driven force to promote economic growth, enhance the accessibility of the labor market; strengthen the logistics supply chain, and open up new markets for enterprises due to their linkages to other sectors. according to the japan international cooperation agency report on the modernisation of vehicle registration in , the number of registered vehicles and motorcycles has increased exponentially. the growth rate in  was approximately %. this growth leads to primary emissions, then the smart moves of the mobility and transportation sector must be required to achieve environmental sustainability and a new mobility ecosystem. 



new mobility and transportation technologies currently take al as the significant perspective, transforming conventional transportation into intelligent transportation the potential al applications on mobility and transportation can be enabled as follows, a_ advanced driver assistance   systems and automated driving  systems: this autonomous technology can enable vehicles, trains, roads, and other infrastructure to communicate with computers, smartphones, or other devices via wireless technologies al capabilities can help increase safety, reliability, and hauling efficiency. for example, autonomous driving systems are designed to offer drivers some functions such as monitoring;  warning;  braking, and  steering  functions: the potential of al can be analysed to predict the end ofthe queue to generate a queue warning message to allow the vehicle to take action: b cybersecurity: al is built in cybersecurity to   provide high security of technologies applied in modern transportation to achieve   efficient operations and prevent any thread interruption. precisely, those automated systems that connected vehicles,  devices, and infrastructure operating together are needed to embed al technology to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the systems by identifying the threadslmalware, preventing the damage resources c accessible transportation: this system uses al to support all travelers, including the elderly or people with disabilities the system consists of many target functions related to transportation, such as pre-trip planning, wayfinding and navigation, surface street crossing, and navigating the complex road. in addition, the auto curb ramp system is also installed in the vehicle or other transportation as an assistant to help the disabled and older adults. al can also promote reliability and safety execute one travel to all links in the travel chain to make it easy for users to access: d_ traveler decision  support tools: the   potential al-enabled   applications   provide adequate   monitoring information to process passenger  requests   (weatherlpricing information) , predict the roadway; arrival times, and other valuable functions such as planning trips: for instance, the transportation system managers can also use the information in the system to support decision-making: transportation systems management and operations: the optimisation of multimodal infrastructure systems using al is built to perform real-time and dynamic service   systems to improve the  transportation   system. decision-making is also considered in this management system to control the work zone, traffic incident, road weather , or other traffic signals:  cyber



f . commercial vehicle and freight  operations: al is embedded to address the operation and movement of vehicle and freight management systems. for example, al is applied in asset tracking, cargo status monitoring, freight optimisation, freight signals, etc , to ensure management efficiency and safety: g transit   operations and management: this   system uses al to perform the management;  operations, maintenance, and security to respond to many services, including maintenance forecasting; event detection, dynamic itinerary planning, and service allocation: this system helps the user monitor and select the service to apply for transit vehicles: h_ emergency management: this is a particular system that uses al to build the alert agency system to address public transportation safety management: the system covers the necessary alerts, such as policies, fire, and emergency medical. air traffic management: to optimise air traffic pathway management, al needs to use the available data to generalise the pathway and provide real-time visualisation of the traffic management system. j remote sensing: drone and uncrewed aerial vehicles have functioned as intelligent remote sensing; which uses al to monitor and control the traffic, bridge inspections, aerial mapping; incident management, and transportation infrastructure. k_ asset management and roadway construction and maintenance: this system focus on the strategic and systematic process of operating, maintaining, and improving physical assets by using al application. the prediction of al can identify a structured sequence of maintenance, preservation, rehabilitation; and replacement actions that requires taking action at a minimum feasible cost. in summary; there are four system functions enabled by al in the mobility and transportation sector: sense and perceive the environment reason and analyse information learn from the experience and adapt to new situations make decisions, communicate, and take actions. the al-enable application is checked with four maturity levels: concept; randd, prototype or minimum viable product; and production. consequently, there are three aspects of al-enabled application: the increased levels of comfort and convenience 



the prospect of vastly improved safety through autonomous driving the macro benefits to the environment (e.g;, potential reduction of emissions) and society (e.g , potential optimisation of traffic less required parking space in city centers)  ... agriculture the agricultural sector is one of cambodia's  roadmap priorities for technology development options. besides, agriculture had gained  percent of cambodias gdp and employed about  million people in , according to a report by the us embassy in cambodia: currently, agriculture technology has rapidly transformed to use advanced machinery and internet of thing technology to analyse and enhance production efficiency. the potential al applications in the agriculture sector can provide into six categories: a agricultural production management: al is enabled in the agricultural production management system to provide information about crop rotation planning, planting time consumption, water and nutrient management; pests and fertilisers and management, disease control, optimal harvest; food marketing; product distribution; food safety, and food supply chain tasks b agricultural production management: al is enabled in the agricultural production management system to provide information about crop rotation planning, planting time consumption, water and nutrient management; pests and fertilisers and management, disease control, optimal harvest; food marketing, product distribution, food safety, and food supply chain tasks c crop monitoring: this system applies al to monitor and identify crop health issues, soil nutrients, weather conditions, irrigation, and other functions that maximise crop revenue. the al-enabled application provides visual instruction and quickly understands soil health, plant pests, and plant disease d_ data science: the agriculture information is stored at all data points every day for further analysis: for example, weather conditions, temperature, irrigation, and soil conditions data are collected from the farm to enable an al model to predict the plant condition whether it will produce high quality or not. real-time data provides a better understanding of the health of plants and optimise natural resources. this approach produces agroecosystem dynamics under changing environmental conditions disease detection: the al-enabled tool is applied to provide the early-warning system to prevent disease outbreaks and spotting insectslanimals in the area of plants al can also trigger the sensor to take action to protect the plant  flow,



f . food quality: food safety and quality assurance use al as a critical role to perform most human tasks to check the plant g predictive analytics: potential al application is performed as data analysis to help farmers protect the land quality , reduce water irrigation, and determine the amount of crop harvested: the prediction is expected to increase the profitability for each field while reducing the environmental impact of pesticides and fertiliser in summary, al will drive the agricultural revolution to an intelligent agricultural ecosystem and sustainability. ... education throughout the ages, countries have seen the profound impact of education on their quality of life (psacharopoulos and patrinos ). with that in mind, nothing could be more transformative than providing consistent  high-quality education across cambodia's population. and these promising advancements are actually more possible than ever through the use of artificial intelligence with its adaptive algorithms as a matter of fact; this new technology is already being used in many classrooms around the world and online to help facilitate learning through virtual and individualised educational platforms: and given how respected teachers currently are in cambodia; improving teachers' impact has become a top priority for cambodian leadership. after all, today's students will become tomorrow's leaders that will advance cambodia's future. cambodian culture values hard work; dedication, and family all of which make for students that are capable of many amasing accomplishments. however; given the financial, geographic, and demographic constraints, providing quality education has been a challenge. that being said, ai and its direct application to facilitate learning has the potential to transform cambodia's education system and substantially raise the quality of life for millions of citizens. in the future, this technology will facilitate the implementation of standardised learning in which the lessons for each student will be based on their capabilities and hard work, not on the limitations of their geographic situation: but delivering on these promises requires focused planning and execution by the leadership of cambodia: currently; however, al in education is far from the  envisioned science fiction avatar that seamlessly interacts with young students. as things are now, al remains in the nascent stages of development: still, many scholars believe that there will be   comprehensive educational applications that work  directly with students. these applications will   understand what each student needs; providing lessons that focus on what exactly the student must focus on to reach the next educational milestone.  the



far before the previously mentioned avatar begins teaching our children, educators will be relying on al to facilitate the traditional classroom setting: in fact, most current applications of al in the classroom help teachers understand where students need specialised lessons or individualised training: al is  helping teachers build smart content; automate   tutoring, grade tests, and categorise learning difficulties: this saves time for the teachers, allowing them to focus on the more substantial aspects of teaching such as lesson planning and student engagement (e.g: al in education) (faggella; ). modern examples of al in education have emerged in countries all over the world. one notable example is china's initiative called education informatisation . digital first education:' one of the first initiatives in this program was to upgrade the curriculum by improving the availability of resources for teachers. to this end, they built a ""shared resource"" platform which makes teachers more productive by providing a well organised digital space for resources that have been collected from all over the country (e.g: education informatisation . in china: motivation, framework, and vision, an exploration into innovative practices of targeted poverty reduction through education using information technology) (yan and yang; ). artificial intelligence will have a similar impact on most other industries as well. additionally, the technology itself is an industry that will provide many opportunities for students that are capable of learning how to use these new tools. some examples include deep learning; statistical analysis; and robotics. cambodian students will undoubtedly have a distinct advantage in using these new technologies: this will in turn help  cambodia realise the educational   promise of   artificial intelligence. ... finance and trade cambodia's gdp growth rate has been extremely stable over time and is now the sixth fastest growing economy in the world: what is unique about this growth is that it has been steady for over  years (see gdp chart): the world economic forum has reported that only  economies worldwide have provided this level of stable growth. this is a sign of resilience and consistency in the country: it is also a sign that cambodia has the discipline and drive to implement new solutions and technological innovations regularly. and artificial intelligence will be yet another solution that helps cambodia thrive in the future (world economic forum, ).  many



 , .  .  .  .  .  .   . .        tradingeconomics.com world bank figure . cambodia's gdp capacity during last decade (world bank, ) as the economy emerges and takes off; it is imperative that its financial sector continues facilitating investment flow while domestic credits pick up. given such opportunities, al technology would find its place in effectively accelerating financial inclusion through its machine-learning innovations that enable more accessible and default-free credit models: 1onon :00n note: this charts will be redone by the art tcam.  4nnn z00n     source: tradingeconomicscom national bank of cambodia figure  . cambodia's export behavior trade is a major reason for why cambodia's gdp growth has had such sustained development. improving trade is directly correlated with improving the economy in cambodia: the better the trade, the better the economy: and artificial intelligence has much to offer when it comes to bettering trade and remaining competitive in tomorrow's international market. as the chart shows, exports are continuing to rise with apparel, footwear, and leather goods being the major drivers of growth. a continued focus on these exports and experimenting with new exports will help 



cambodia thrive in already fertile markets such as the usa, china, and germany as shown in figure above. al provides many opportunities for efficiency and growth in the world market: for example, the implementation of al for language translation in e-commerce has been shown to produce more than % growth in online international trade sales (brynjolfsson et al., ). and there are other such examples in which al tools are capable of managing compliance despite the numerous complexities between suppliers, clients , and   shifting trade restrictions: without al, many industries rely on mere human intervention to constantly check for errors however; by using al, the system can learn how to handle these problems more efficiently and accurately, which in turn allows for a more seamless compliance operation. united belgium vietnam united states china kingdom .% .% ./.% netherlands | thailand spain |france japan .% .%|.%|.%/ .% south: . canada italy .% .% .% hong kong incia russia . united _ germany .% poland ireland % australia . gabon .% singapore  figure . cambodia export by contry al is also making a significant contribution by optimising the supply chain: the significant lead time required for many supply operations can derail trade operations by causing a myriad of time delays, especially when there are complex multipart orders. the ordering of one part might mean the ordering of sixty different other parts, all with different lead times. getting ahead of these orders is to delivering your products on time: similarly  significant capability of this technology is the implementation of al based  smart contracts. this is where the legal contract is essentially broken down into computer code in which business rules are implemented, which then allows al to avoid any costly mistakes while reducing manual checking: these factors all lead to easier access to trade and financing because the business investors are more confident in a process that they can measure and trust: as more countries continue to implement al for international trade, the compatibility of such technology across different countries would mean better communication, efficiency, and fairness in international dealings. for example, a smaller country might feel more comfortable in a deal in  key



which all of its factors are being considered and intentionally maximised in discussions with larger countries that have more resources. and wealthier countries will have the chance to better international relations and improve the quality of life in smaller countries with al handling the nuances for both sides the overall benefits of implementing al in negotiations are that each side can move faster; have deeper confidence, and feel more comfortable with the outcomes the is having a system that each party can trust and that can illuminate alternatives that might have otherwise been unthought of by both sides (hone, ). this is how al becomes sewn into the fabric of international trade. and while it does not completely replace the process or the people, it is still implemented in almost every component, delivering an improved trading operation: these improvements will be realised right to the bottom line in cambodia, thereby driving the gdp to even higher levels (nesbitt; )_ ... healthcare and medicine healthcare is one of the most important areas for the use of al. cambodia has already begun working with companies that utilise various levels of diagnostic technologies embedded with al. for example, cara has tools that help   diagnose eye and cardiovascular disease in cambodia: this is just the beginning: artificial intelligence has the capability for use in almost every area of healthcare from diagnostics, surgery, operational  efficiencies, and population disease projection analytics (davenport and kalakota, ). future opportunities include smart hospitals where equipment and infrastructure are embedded with contact sensors that bring a hospital's architecture to a level of ambient intelligence. these tools have provided new levels of protection for clinical professionals and safety for patients by interpreting their surroundings and gathering additional relevant data for clinicians (standford university, ). the development of such artificial intelligence in healthcare has undergone many evolutions: in the early 80s, logic systems consisting of  if-then-else statements and massive rules-base engineering were defined as a type of intelligence: however, diagnostic professionals found these tools to be overwhelmingly complex and difficult to manage. one of the primary challenges was keeping the current knowledge base up-to-date, especially if the recommendation engine was providing dosage calculations: also, rule engines typically consisted of hundreds and thousands of statements, all of which were largely error-prone and hardly classifiable in today's modern ai engines (davenport and kalakota; ). (the potential for artificial intelligence in healthcare) most of today's al technology is based on neural networks and deep learning: such technology allows machines to perform tasks without specifically being programmed to do so. in this way, computers can learn from data and perform tasks in a more human-friendly way: aii kinds of problems are being efficiently handled by al in the medical field. for instance, the massive amount of data doctors has to analyse when diagnosing a patient is typically colossal.  key



health records are spread across multiple systems and do not follow any standard protocol. but al tools bring all of the data together; then these tools analyse the structured and unstructured results to produce probabilistic diagnostics that can help the doctor quickly identify a potential illness: in addition to   diagnostics, artificial intelligence is also becoming common in treatment recommendations and avoiding medical errors with the massive amount of data available each year, it is difficult or impossible for all clinical professionals to be up-to-date on the potential treatment   regimens for uncommon diagnoses. an  empirical explaining this medical challenge has been done using modern machine-learning algorithms in the cambodian children's hospital (oonsivilai et al,,). this study focused on the patient's antibiotic susceptibility based on patient-specific predictions. the result from the study outperformed the logistic regression models and has proved itself to be very beneficial when it comes to issuing prescriptions since it can prevent the inappropriate overuse of antibiotics, thereby reducing the patient's resistance to antibiotic treatment: every year more medical articles are produced than could ever be read by one person. in  nearly  million scientific articles were published, and that trend has grown % every year (chi; ). furthermore, it has been well documented that patient allergy management; dangerous drug-to-drug interactions, and dealing with other complex medical conditions have yielded a risky environment for patients but al tools can quickly digest the latest articles and recalculate potential treatment plans almost instantaneously: this helps safeguard patients by providing clinicians with focused, uncluttered   information. al is also being used to help clinical professionals more accurately and effectively identify medical treatments with the best probability of success: for example, ibm watson reads the patient's medical record and then determines the likelihood of a stroke, it then provides the potential success of a variety of different treatments (ibm, ). surgical robots have also been assisting clinicians for decades: but recently these robots are being embedded with ai: this is largely seen in common surgeries such as gynecologic and prostate procedures. such technology helps the surgeon focus on more complex matters while removing much of the basic logistics of the operation (davenport and kalakota, ). surgeons are also using al to help keep track of all the relevant factors in their decision-making: these factors include the values and emotions of the patient, case complexity, individual judgment; and time constraints. bringing al tools into the surgical decision-making process helps clarify all the factors of these decisions within an objective framework: patients thereby end up with a better outcome when both human and automated decision-making come together over their surgical procedures (loftus et al,, ).  study



.. challenges al is currently used extensively in commercial applications like targeting advertisements, search optimisation, customer service, healthcare, transportation, and the robotic applications that have been previously explained in this article. the basic technological principles for implementing these systems have been around for decades, but the computational power and clean data necessary to implement these ideas have only recently become feasible. the most promising aspect of this implementation is supervised learning: this provides the foundation for many of the most practical examples of al in business (mckinsey global institute, ). however, there are many challenges and concerns that come with the use of al. certainly, machine learning requires massive amounts of data and computing time. researchers are generally challenged when it comes to finding high-quality, unbiased training sets to teach ai. in many cases, hundreds of thousands, if not millions of records are required to properly implement deep learning algorithms. and data sets containing biased information can lead to undesirable results: most algorithms and data sets need to be tuned to the appropriate objective and all algorithms need to be tested to make sure the results are correct and appropriate. every effort should be made for data to be stored in a usable format and be well documented so it can be appropriately applied in a learning model. data manipulation alone is one of the most expensive and time- consuming parts of any al project. there are other cultural challenges to consider that branch out into new issues for leadership when it comes to incorporating al. a cautious yet experimental mindset is necessary for this new technology enterprise to be successful. errors are natural and even helpful for our understanding: although sometimes the cost in time and money might increase, it should still be considered a milestone for progress governments and companies hoping to use al also need to focus on innovation, critical thinking, and stem in their educational system: external subject matter experts will certainly be able to help with data formatting and processing algorithms: however , experts who understand the underlying data and principles of how the information might be best used are in a position to maximise the impact and profitability of this new technology (mackinsey global institute , )_ in addition to the challenges faced by leadership, data quality, and bias, is also held back by computing power and infrastructure: specifically, al implementation is hampered by the lack of available talent and intellectually skilled practitioners, not to mention financing: in many areas funding is not available to test applications or even to provide the time to consider how these new solutions might be applied. in the short term, this research takes time and money. but in the run; the potential benefits will far outweigh the investment (mackinsey global institute, ).  key ai long



there has been much written about how al will take jobs away from unskilled or easily automated workers. this can especially be seen in cambodia where industries are still labor intensive (an; ) and have low economy-of-scale in terms of market size. this means that most of these industries would not allow cambodian businesses to afford advanced automated and robotic machines that are made available by al technology: this typically leads to hesitation to invest and experiment with al: however; al brings other opportunities, especially in the early stages of transition: one example in education involves the potential confusion between the student and the al program's design: the implementation of al based learning systems in china; for example, required the hiring of hundreds of ""tutors"" to help students during the implementation of their lessons: and % of these positions were filled by women who would have otherwise gone unemployed (xinxin et al,, ). the transition to al for a country or a company will not be simple and seamless: there are and will be advances in some areas and challenges in others the foundation of al demands hard work in infrastructure and normal information; as well as communication technology (ict): but cambodia has already been implementing a plan to fortify these fundamental infrastructure components (sean and lor, ). there have been many famous examples that show how al can make errors and provide misleading answers during this transition. one famous example is google's ""gfe, which is short for ""google flu trends:' it was an experimental tool that was intended to predict flu outbreaks in the united states. initial results seemed promising; but unfortunately, it was determined that the data was unreliable in its predictions and the project was terminated: other examples include the microsoft chat bot that was making sexist and racist statements. it was shut down within  hours of operation: there was also the amazon al hiring blunder where selections that had been in use for years were clearly biased: none of these errors negate the fact that al is a powerful technology that is here to stay. improvements in the algorithms and data sets will undoubtedly drive positive performance in the future (tennery and cherelus, ). healthcare diagnostics and procedural processes with al have also been successfully deployed: however, widespread use of al to displace caregivers is unlikely in the short-term, and perhaps in the long term. this is because of the tremendous shortage in clinical professionals in cambodia and around the world. additionally, al is seen as a diagnostic helper, but will probably never be a tool to deliver a diagnosis. patients tend to prefer face-to-face dialogue around their diagnoses and potential treatment options. therefore; although al can be extremely helpful and even necessary to ease the burden of clinical diagnostics, it will not be a replacement (davenport kalakota; ). in many situations; the output and associated logical explanation of al has not been made clear: for example, educational al has been struggling to build models that allow students to learn in  also,



steps: it has been well documented that  porting curriculum content into usable al-based frameworks is challenging and expensive. also, identifying laddering technologies that serve to identify students' level of understanding has additional complexities. for example, a student that understands to do addition but  struggles with   multiplication naturally needs   specific, individualised attention in multiplication. this requires lessons to be linked in a sophisticated manner that is machine readable and integrated across curriculums: implementing a 'knowledge tree' for such students involves an efficient network of lessons that require advanced skills, an in-depth knowledge of databases, and a solid understanding of the interplay within such systems to see how the al model will respond to the sum total of its overall usage. fortunately, there are many working examples of well planned and executed al based learning engines. one example is the system implemented in china to help non-native speakers learn mandarin. the system has an al-based engine that engages the students and determines their level of   comprehension. then it continuously adjusts their   experience to maximise understanding: students using this system have shown significantly improved test results (xinxin et al,,). cybersecurity and   confidentiality are also major challenges for al, particularly when the information is clinical or financially related: the implementation of al also raises confidentiality and intellectual property (ip) issues. training data often needs to be copied and edited for use, which may lead to a certain degree of vulnerability: with that in mind, cybersecurity should be a completely integral part of every al project in order to properly consider the necessary protocols for  safety, security , and protecting intellectual property, as well as safeguarding  personal information. regular testing and audits are required to ensure a safe and secure environment: furthermore, proper data governance, threat detection, and legal review should be fundamental to any technological project (oseni et al,, ). in cambodia; this technology is not just about al. it is about creating a digital framework within the existing infrastructure to implement its learning capability  alongside the work of information and communication technology (ict). a relevant legal  framework on data and cybersecurity is also needed to be in force to combat cybercrimes and to also provide assurance to relevant businesses, practitioners, and consumers in the field: infrastructure is the and there is already a basic technological foundation that cambodia has been building for years that will be leveraged to maximise the impact of al in education (sean and lor, ). recently, the royal government of cambodia has put forth in its cambodia digital economy and society policy framework - specific measures within the short and medium term of its plan to boost investment in infrastructure and the application of al in data governance, particularly in data use and analysis (royal government  of cambodia, ). however , to effectively use al, an environment of experimentation and  innovation is necessary: basic  how key;



research and prototyping are required. but proper leadership and guidance for such objectives are also necessary to purposely direct this technology in a way that solves real problems for cambodia: technological projects have suffered from weak leadership and misguided objectives: but constant measurement, objective evaluation, and experimenting with potential solutions are necessary in avoiding such issues: the current reality of al is undoubtedly promising: and the truth is that al is already producing positive results that are used daily in business, clinical, and mechanical settings far from magic, the   technology is math-intensive and   requires highly skilled   professionals for planning; implementation, assessment;, and continuous monitoring/teedback to ensure appropriate results. and while the initial stages of development are error-prone, the daily use of successfully implemented al platforms is simple and extremely reliable. even now, al continues to prove its worth despite the challenges of its development: but that being said, the most important key to its success is good leadership that realises the undeniable benefits al has in store for cambodia. 6_ al for cambodia: policy framework and options artificial intelligence (al) is one of the essential technologies in the world game changing in every sector to improve productivity, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. in order to foster trustworthy al ecosystems, it is essential for countries to develop human-centered policies that promote socio- economic and responsible al research and development: this includes policies that encourage investment in such initiatives: these policies of al development should take into account its national development vision as well as regional and global trends: the country's objectives; preferences, and overarching strategy for al advancement in both immediate and distant future should be clarified. initially, the main objective is to cultivate skilled personnel and employ al solutions to deal with critical national focus areas that will have a swift impact on cambodia's socio-economic  status_ over  time , the priority should shift  to developing  fundamental and advanced research; promoting high-level al research and innovation, and   establishing cambodia's standing in advanced technology on a global scale to reach this goal, here are some policy recommendations for cambodia: . . define national focus areas cambodia has experienced a significant increase in internet users as part of its pursuit to become digital nation. these users employ the internet for various reasons such as entertainment; work, and business growth. consequently, innovative technologies like lots, big data analytics, and ai are increasingly becoming prevalent in cambodia's daily activities. to maximize this technological advancement; cambodia should prioritize the utilization of al in developmental sectors: these sectors should be carefully selected to ensure that they align with the country's overall development goals. the recommendations areas should include:  many key key



service for sme: with the rapid growth of internet users, many businesses are eager to adopt advanced technologies that can enhance customer experiences and drive business growth. one way to achieve this is by collecting and analyzing data from customers' past experiences, which can help companies deliver  relevant  services based on their preferences and needs to leverage these technologies effectively, the policies should focus on areas such as retail and e-commerce, online advertising; and customer support manufacturing: the of cambodia's gdp has been significantly influenced by its manufacturing sector. to further enhance productivity and cost-effectiveness in manufacturing and keep up with the fourth industrial revolution; implementation of al can help transform traditional manufacturing into advanced and smart manufacturing: this, in turn; will enable cambodia to compete effectively in regional and global markets, leading to positive socio-economic progress: the integration of   technology in manufacturing can involve real-time data collection through lot, automation processes using robotics, and improved daily operations and decision-making through information systems and ai: mobility and transportation: transportation and mobility is a significant factor in stimulating economic growth, improving market accessibility, strengthening logistics supply chains, and creating new opportunities for businesses by connecting different sectors. introducing al to improve the efficiency and accessibility of transportation and mobility can aid cambodia in achieving its environmental sustainability, road safety, and socio-economic  objectives. to effectively implement al in transportation, it is crucial to focus on improving transport   accessibility, management and  operation systems, emergency response management; security measures, and roadway maintenance and management agriculture: in , agriculture contributed % to cambodia's gdp and provided employment opportunities to around  million individuals. with the advancements in technology, the agricultural sector has rapidly evolved and incorporated sophisticated machinery and internet of things technology to enhance production efficiency. given that cambodia is primarily an agricultural-based country, the implementation of al for enhancing agricultural productivity is imperative: the potential applications of al in agriculture include managing production; monitoring crop growth, analyzing data and making informed decisions, detecting diseases, monitoring food quality and safety, and conducting predictive analysis. education: providing consistent; high-quality education to its citizens will a significant impact on both people's lifestyles, well-being and the country's economic growth. in today's digital age, al and other technologies have revolutionized the way we teach and learn. despite potential challenges, these applications offer immense  key growth bring



benefits for transforming education. however, since technology accessibility is still limited in some regions of cambodia due to socio-economic and geographic factors: therefore , to maximize the of al in education requires improving three main strategies: ) improve digital infrastructure and funding to accessibility to technology for   every student; ) providing clear national   policies and guidelines on the implementation of al in teaching and learning activities, and ) using technology to make learning contents accessible to all students regardless of their location. finance and trade: in order for cambodia's economy to continue its growth trajectory, it is   crucial that the financial sector keeps facilitating investment   flow while also supporting domestic credits. the country's sustained development in terms of gdp growth can be attributed to trade; which plays a significant role in boosting the economy: therefore, enhancing trade is directly linked to improving the overall economy of cambodia. in this context; leveraging the potential of artificial intelligence can prove to be advantageous in terms of enhancing finance, trade and maintaining competitiveness in the global market of the future al tools can be implemented in finance and trend analysis to enhance various aspects of businesses such as international trade through automatic  language   translation,  ensuring compliance with regulations, providing efficient customer support, creating customer profiles for targeted marketing; optimizing the supply chain management; and executing smart contracts. healthcare: access to high-quality healthcare is crucial for the overall well-being and development of a country, and it should be a top priority in every nation's development goals. artificial intelligence (al) is playing an increasingly important role in healthcare worldwide, and cambodia is already working with companies that use al-powered diagnostic technologies the potential applications of al in healthcare are vast, from diagnostics and surgery to operational efficiencies and population disease projection analytics and   prediction: to  prevent medical errors, cambodia should consider implementing smart hospitals where   technology is integrated into equipment; infrastructure, and processes to enhance diagnosis and treatment  tourism: tourism is a significant contributor to cambodia's economy; with around . million domestic and . million international tourists visiting in  prior to the covid-  pandemic. however; in , only . million international visitors were recorded, highlighting the impact of the pandemic on travel: therefore, it has become essential to utilize technology as a means to enhance tourism activities and help the industry recover. .. develop a national al regulation and guidelines al has the potential to bring numerous benefits to society and the economy, but it also carries significant risks and responsibilities, particularly regarding privacy, ethics, and security.  profit



to ensure that al applications prioritize human-centered benefits, cambodia must develop regulations and guidelines by a multi-ministries committee: the committee shall consist  of the ministry of industry,  science ,  technology and innovation; ministry of post and telecommunication and ministry of education, youth and sport: this new regulation and guidelines require harmonizing existing laws and creating new data protection laws that govern sensitive personal information throughout its lifecycle, from capture to storage, sharing, use, and archiving: to safeguard citizens' privacy, organizations of all sizes including academia should adopt a privacy-by-design approach to developing al applicationslalgorithms the multi-ministries committee should also oversee the proper incorporation of ethics and privacy measures in al development to ensure compliance with best practices .. develop a national al infrastructure in order for al to be fully utilized, it is crucial to have a strong infrastructure that supports the development and implementation of al systems  this infrastructure should be initiated by the government with the support from private industries and academia. this infrastructure shall be used to support students, researchers, universities, and industries in their pursuit of al innovation: it shall consider various components such as hardware, software, data, and human resources that are necessary for the research and deployment of al solutions: essential components of this infrastructure may include high-performance computing systems, cloud-based platforms for data storage and processing, and open-source ai frameworks and libraries: .. promote in al research, innovation, education and talent development the future is expected to see the integration of emerging technologies such as big data, cloud computing; cyber security, data science, al, robotics, 3d printing; blockchain, and internet of things (lots) across various industries  including  businesses, healthcare,  agriculture, and education: talent and skill development: cambodia faces a shortage of highly skilled workers in these areas, which highlights the need for educational reforms to equip students with modern skill sets that align with the demands of the future labor market: in addition, one of draw-back when using al is job displacement to tackle this challenge, the government can prioritize and support talent and skill development initiatives. these could be: 



ministry of education, youth and sport shall encourage educational institutions to provide specialize course for talent and skill development ministry of economics shall allocate skill development budget to support such initiatives companies can invest in training their workers with the necessary skills educational institutions can play the role of trainer to provide necessary training to companies developing al research culture: for sustainable benefits and human capital development, cambodia should also encourage al research and innovation activities. this may include: ministry of education, youth and sport shall provide incentives and fund for al research and innovation this incentive and fund shall be classified into  categories: research fundamental: to support initiatives of researchers and academia innovation   research: to support   applied research that are potential  for commercialization. this research shall be the cooperation between educational institutions and industries flagship project: to support long-term and impactful research projects. this kind of project shall consist of educational institutions, industrial and international organizations: .. develop ai ecosystem to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth, cambodia's development strategy should prioritize investing more in al research; innovation, and entrepreneurship. this can be accomplished by: creating an al ecosystem that fosters collaboration beyond just cooperation among stakeholders: use the quadruple helix paradigm to involves academics, government, industrial and societies to ensure social equality , minimize perpetuate biases and pose privacy risks develop a national strategy to encourage business collaboration: this may include: the ministry of economic shall consider funding budgets to support public-private partnerships research and innovation; knowledge transfer and commercialization on applied-al projects. governments should also consider policies such as tax reductions or incentives for industries investing in al research and innovation: such policies will encourage industry to invest in research and development; build innovative applications, and generate job opportunities 



encourage collaboration between industry and educational institutions. academia can contribute research expertise, train talent, and facilitate knowledge transfer to industry .. foster international collaborations global collaboration and swift policy actions are essential in the market-driven field of al. for cambodia to remain competitive on the stage, it is crucial to cultivate world-class talent through various strategies: the first step is to identify skill gaps in education, research, and innovation. then, offer attractive scholarships and incentives for cambodian individuals to study abroad and fill these gaps. the scholarship source can be funding by government through budget planning organized by ministry of education, youth and sport industry funding international cooperation and co-funding secondly; cambodia needs to establish its own research platform to  facilitate knowledge sharing and promote research activities amongst cambodian researchers, ultimately improving the quality of research in the country and creating opportunities for international partnerships: lastly, implementing a special   grant package that encourages regional and international collaboration will help to advance al research and innovation in cambodia and elevate cambodia's research quality to an international level.  global

model artificial intelligence governance framework  foreword in , the world saw significant advances in the sophistication and pervasive use of artificial intelligence (""al""). for instance, we witnessed the emergence of next-generation al-powered natural text generators like gpt-, which can generate passages that are difficult to distinguish from human writing: we also saw the development of dactyl, a robotic hand, which uses reinforcement learning to grasp and manipulate common household objects with human-like dexterity: these examples attest to the of al's advancement and how it will become ubiquitous in our daily lives. the discourse on al ethics and governance has also moved forward. over the last two years, governments and international organisations have begun issuing principles, frameworks and recommendations on al ethics and governance. in january , singapore launched our model al governance framework (""model framework"") at the world economic forum in davos: the model frameworks unique contribution to the global discourse on al ethics lies in translating ethical principles into practical recommendations that organisations could readily adopt to deploy al responsibly we are heartened by the diversity of organisations that have adopted the  practices outlined in the model framework, which underscores its ease-of-use and relevance. singapore is to launch the second edition of the model framework. this edition incorporates the experiences of organisations thathave adopted al, and feedback from our participation in leading international platforms, such as the european commission's high-level expert group and the oecd expert group on al. such input has enabled us to provide clearer and effective guidance for organisations to implement al responsibly: speed proud



 singapore's info-communications media development authority (""imda"") and personal data protection commission (""pdpc"") have also partnered the world economic forum centre for the fourth industrial revolution to develop an implementation and self-assessment guide for organisations (""isago""). the isago complements the model framework by allowing organisations to assess the alignment of their al governance practices with the model framework, while providing useful industry examples and practices. we are also publishing a compendium of use cases, which features real- world examples of how organisations have implemented or aligned their al governance practices with the model framework. together; these initiatives enable any organisation to establish and refine its al governance practices in concrete and practical ways. these initiatives play a critical role in singapores national al strategy: epitomise our plans to develop a human-centric approach towards al governance that builds and sustains trust. also reflect our emphasis on co-creating an al ecosystem in a collaborative and inclusive manner: the model framework and isago will pave the way for future developments, such as the training of professionals on ethical al deployment; and laying the groundwork for singapore, and the world, to better address als impact on society: the steps we take today will leave an indelible imprint on our collective future. the model framework has been recognised as a firm foundation for the responsible use of al and its future evolution. we will build on this momentum to advance a human-centric approach to al one that facilitates innovation and safeguards trust to ensure al's positive impact on the world for generations to come. s iswaran minister for communications and information singapore january  they public they public



model artificial intelligence governance framework  . preamble



 . the model framework focuses primarily on four broad areas: internal governance structures and measures, human involvement in al-augmented decision-making, operations management and stakeholder interaction and communication. while the model framework is certainly not limited in ambition, it is ultimately limited by form, purpose and practical considerations of scope. with that in mind, several caveats bear mentioning: the model framework is a  algorithm-agnostic it does not focus on al or data analytics methodology: it applies to the design, application and use of al in general. b. technology-agnostic it does not focus on systems, software or technology and will apply regardless of development language and data storage method: sector-agnostic it serves as a baseline set of considerations and measures for organisations operating in any sector to adopt: specific sectors or organisations may choose to include additional considerations and measures or adapt this baseline set to meet their needs. the pdpc encourages and will collaborate with agencies adapting the model framework for their sectors. d. scale- and business-model-agnostic it does not focus on organisations of a particular scale or size. it can also be used by organisations engaging in business-to-business or business-to-consumer activities and operations, or in any other business model. specific specific public



model artificial intelligence governance framework  . it is recognised that there are a number of issues that are closely interrelated to the ethical use and deployment of al. this model framework does not focus on these specific issues, which are often sufficient in scope to warrant separate study and treatment: examples of these issues include: a articulating a new set of ethical principles for ai. there are already a number of  attempts   globally in establishing a universal set of principles. while a consistent core set of ethical principles is emerging, there is also a penumbra of variation across cultures, jurisdictions and industry sectors. the model framework uses existing and common al ethical principles (a compilation of which is set out in annex a) and converts them into implementable practices. b. providing model frameworks and addressing issues around data sharing, whether between the and private sectors or between  organisations or within consortia. there are a number of guides that are relevant, such as the imda's trusted data sharing framework and the guide to data valuation for data sharing: discussing issues   relating to the legal liabilities associated with al, intellectual property rights, and societal impacts of al on employment; competition, unequal access to al products and services by different segments of society, al technologies falling into hands of wrong people) , etc: these issues are nevertheless pertinent and can be separately through platforms such as the centre for al and data governance established in the singapore management university school of law: public (e.g: explored



 . introduction



model artificial intelligence governance framework  objectives . the exponential growth in data and computing power has fuelled the advancement of data-driven technologies such as ai. al can be used by organisations to provide new and services, boost productivity, enhance competitiveness, ultimately leading to economic growth and a better quality of life. as with any new technology, however; al also introduces new ethical, legal and governance   challenges: these include risks of unintended discrimination potentially leading to unfair outcomes, as well as issues relating to consumers' knowledge abouthow al is involved in making significant or sensitive decisions about them: . the pdpc,' with advice from the advisory council, proposes this second edition of the and voluntary model framework as a general, ready-to-use tool to enable organisations that are deploying al solutions at scale to do so in a responsible manner this model framework is not intended for organisations that are deploying updated commercial off-the-shelf software packages that happen to now incorporate al in their feature set: . this voluntary model framework provides guidance on the issues to be considered and measures that can be implemented. adopting this model framework will require tailoring the measures to address the risks identified for the implementing organisation. the model framework is intended to assist organisations to achieve the following objectives: a_ build stakeholder confidence in al through organisations'  responsible use of al to manage different risks in al deployment b_ demonstrate   reasonable efforts to align internal policies, structures and processes with relevant accountability-based practices in data management and protection (e.g: the personal data protection act  (""pdpa"") and the oecd privacy principles). under section  of singapore's personal data protection act ,the imda is designated as the pdpc: goods living key



 . to assist organisations in implementing the model framework, the pdpc has also prepared a complementary isago. the isago helps organisations assess the alignment of their al governance practices and processes with the model framework: it also provides additional useful industry references and examples that further clarify the recommendations set out in this model framework . the extent to which organisations adopt the recommendations in this model framework depends on several factors, including the nature and complexity of the al used by organisations, the extent to which al is employed in the organisations' decision- making, and the severity and probability of the impact of the autonomous decision on individuals. . to elaborate: al technologies may be used to augment a human decision-maker or to autonomously make a decision for instance, the impact of an autonomous decision in medical diagnosis is arguably greater than that in a product recommendation: the commercial risks of al deployment is therefore proportionate to the impact on individuals. generally, where the cost of implementing al technologies in an ethical manner outweighs the expected benefits, organisations should consider whether alternative non-alsolutions should be adopted: the considerations and recommendations set out in this framework are intended to guide   organisations that have decided to deploy ai technologies at scale.



model artificial intelligence governance framework  guiding principles . the model framework is based on two high-level  guiding principles that promote trust in al and understanding ofthe use of al technologies: a organisations al in decision-making should ensure thatthe decision-making process is explainable , transparent and fair. although perfect  explainability,  transparency and fairness are impossible to attain, organisations should strive to ensure that their use or application of al is undertaken in a manner that reflects the objectives of these principles as far as possible. this helps build trust and confidence in ai: b. al solutions should be human-centric. as al is used to amplify human capabilities, the protection ofthe interests of human beings, including their well-being and should be the primary considerations in the  design, development and deployment of ai: organisations should ensure that al decision-making processes are explainable, transparent and fair while al solutions should be human-centric: using safety,



 . like other technologies, al aims to increase human productivity: however; unlike earlier technologies, some aspects of autonomous predictions or decisions made by al may not be fully explainable: as al technologies can make decisions that affect individuals, or have a significant impact on society, markets or economies, organisations should consider this model framework to their deployment of ai. . organisations should detail a set of ethical principles when embark on deployment of al at scale within their processes or to empower their products and/or services. where necessary, organisations may wish to refer to the compilation of al ethical principles in annex a: as far as possible, organisations should also review their existing corporate values and incorporate the ethical principles that have articulated: some of the ethical principles (e.g: safety) may be articulated as risks that can be incorporated into the corporate risk management framework the model framework is designed to assist organisations incorporating ethical principles into familiar and pre-existing corporate governance structures, and thereby aid in guiding the adoption of al in an organisation: using guide they they by



model artificial intelligence governance framework  assumptions . the model framework aims to discuss good data management practices in general. the model framework is mainly applicable to machine learning models (as compared to pure decision tree-driven al models). . the model framework does not address the risk of catastrophic failure due to cyber-attacks on an organisation heavily dependent on al. organisations remain responsible for ensuring the availability, reliability, quality and safety of their products and services, regardless of whether al technologies are used: . adopting this voluntary model framework will not absolve organisations from compliance with current laws and regulations: however; as this is an accountability-based framework, adopting it will assist  organisations in demonstrating that had implemented accountability-based practices in data management and protection, eg- the pdpa and oecd privacy principles . further; it should be noted that certain industry sectors (such as in the finance, healthcare, and legal sectors) may be regulated by existing  sector-specific laws,  regulations or guidelines relevant to the sector: for example, the monetary authority of singapore published the principles to promote fairness, ethics, accountability and transparency in the use of artificial intelligence and data analytics in singapore's financial sector (the feat principles"") to provide guidance to firms that use al and data analytics to offer financial products and services.? organisations are advised to remain mindful of such laws, regulations and guidelines, as adopting the model framework does not mean that organisations are in compliance with such sector-specific laws, regulations or guidelines monetary authority of singapore, ""principles to promote fairness, ethics, accountability and transparency (feat) in the use of artificial intelligence and data analytics in singapore's financial sector' ( november )  . they



 definitions f . the following simplified diagram depicts the stakeholders in an al adoption process discussed in the model framework the adoption process does not distinguish between business- to-consumer (""b2c""), business-to-business (""b2b"") , and business- to-business-to-consumer (""b2bzc"") relationships: al solution providers organisations individuals . some terms used in al may have different definitions depending on context and use. the definitions of some terms used in this model framework are as follows: refers to a set of technologies that seek to simulate human ""al"" traits such as knowledge, reasoning, problem solving, perception; learning and planning, and, depending on the al model, produce an output or decision (such as a prediction, recommendation, and/or classification): al technologies rely on al algorithms to generate models. the most appropriate model(s) is/are selected and deployed in a production system. al solution develop al solutions or application systems that make providers"" use of al technology: these include not just commercial off-the-shelf products, online services, mobile applications, and other software that consumers can use directly, but also b2bzc applications, e.g: al-powered fraud detection software sold to financial institutions. also include device and equipment manufacturers that integrate al-powered features into their products, and those whose solutions are not standalone products but are meant to be integrated into a final product: some organisations develop their own al solutions and can be their own solution providers. ""organisations refers to companies or other entities that adopt or deploy al solutions in their  operations, such as backroom operations processing applications for loans) , front-of-house services (e.g: e-commerce portal or ride-hailing app) , or the sale or distribution of devices that provide al-powered features (e.g: smart home appliances). ""individuals"" can, depending on the context, refer to persons to whom organisations intend to supply al products and/or services, or persons who have already purchased the al products and/or services these may be referred to as consumers or customers' as well: this definition of al was adapted from various sources, and contextualised accordingly for the purposes of this model framework. it should not be taken to be an authoritative or exhaustive definition. key key they (e.g:

 model ai governance framework . this model framework   comprises   guidance on measures promoting the responsible use of al that organisations should adopt in the following areas: a internal governance structures and measures adapting existing or setting up internal governance structure and measures to incorporate values, risks, and responsibilities relating to algorithmic decision-making: b_ determining the level of human involvement in al-augmented decision-making a methodology to aid organisations in setting its risk appetite for use of al, i.e. determining acceptable risks and identifying an appropriate level of human involvement in al-augmented decision-making: c operations management issues to be considered when developing, selecting and maintaining al models, including data management: d. stakeholder interaction and communication strategies for  communicating with an organisation's stakeholders , and the management of relationships with them: . organisations adopting this model framework may find that not all elements are relevant: this model framework is meant to be flexible, and organisations can adapt the model framework to suit their needs and adopting those elements that are relevant: . to help organisations better understand the model framework, we have included (in each section) illustrations demonstrating how real-world companies have implemented certain practices described in that section. in addition, the pdpc has also released a compendium of use cases that illustrates how various local and international organisations have put in place al governance practices that are aligned to all sections of the model framework. key specific



model artificial intelligence governance framework  internal governance structures and measures . this section is intended to organisations in developing appropriate internal governance structures that allow organisations to have appropriate oversight over how ai technologies are brought into their operations and/or products and services. . internal governance structures and measures help to ensure robust oversight over an organisation's use of ai. the organisation's existing internal governance structures can be adapted, andlor new structures can be implemented if necessary: for example, risks associated with the use of al can be managed within the enterprise risk management structure, while ethical considerations can be introduced as corporate values and managed through ethics review boards or similar structures: ethical considerations can be introduced as corporate values and managed through ethics review boards or similar structures. . organisations may also consider determining the appropriate features in their internal governance structures. for example, when relying completely on a centralised governance mechanism is not optimal, a de-centralised one could be considered to incorporate ethical considerations into day-to-day decision- making at the operational level, if necessary: the sponsorship, support and participation of the organisation's top management and its board of directors in the organisation's al governance are crucial: guide



 . organisations may wish to consider including features that are relevant to the development of their internal governance structure, such as:  clear roles and responsibilities for the ethical deployment of ai a responsibility for and oversight of the various stages and activities involved in al deployment should be allocated to the appropriate  personnel and/or departments. if necessary and possible, consider establishing a coordinating body, having relevant expertise and proper representation from across the organisation: b personnel andlor departments having internal al governance functions should be fully aware of their roles and responsibilities, be properly trained, and be provided with the resources and guidance needed for them to discharge their duties. c roles and responsibilities that can be allocated include: l. using any existing risk management framework and applying risk control measures (see risk management and internal controls' below) to: assess and manage the risks of deploying al, including any potential adverse impact on the individuals who are most vulnerable, how are impacted, how to assess the scale of the impact, how to get feedback from those impacted, etc ) decide on the appropriate level of human involvement in al-augmented decision-making: manage the al model training and selection process: key (e.g: they



model artificial intelligence governance framework  ii. maintenance, monitoring, documentation and review of the al models that have been deployed, with a view to taking remediation measures where needed. mi. reviewing communications channels and interactions with stakeholders to provide disclosure and effective feedback channels. iv. ensuring relevant staff dealing with al systems are properly trained. where applicable and necessary, staff who are working and interacting directly with al models may need to be trained to interpret al model output and decisions and to detect and manage bias in data: other staff whose work deals with the al system (e.g: a customer relationship officer answering customer queries about the al system, or a salesperson   using an al-enabled product to make a recommendation) should be trained to be at least aware of and sensitive to the benefits, risks and limitations when using al, so that they know when to alert subject-matter experts within their organisations



 . risk management and internal controls a organisations can consider implementing a sound system of risk management and internal controls that specifically addresses the risks involved in the deployment of the selected al model. b such measures include: using reasonable efforts to ensure that the datasets used for al model training are adequate for the intended purpose, and to assess and manage the risks of inaccuracy or bias, as well as reviewing exceptions identified during model training: virtually, no dataset is   completely unbiased. organisations should strive to understand the ways in which datasets may be biased and address this in their safety measures and deployment strategies ii. establishing monitoring and reporting systems as well as processes to ensure that the appropriate level of management is aware of the performance of and other issues relating to the deployed ai. where appropriate, the monitoring can include autonomous monitoring to effectively scale human oversight: al systems can be designed to report on the confidence level of their predictions, and explainability features could focus on why the al model had a certain level of confidence. mii. ensuring proper knowledge transfer whenever there are changes in personnel involved in ai activities. this will reduce the risk of staff movement creating a gap in internal governance. iv. reviewing the internal governance structure and measures when there are significant changes to organisational structure or personnel involved. v_ periodically reviewing the internal governance structure and measures to ensure their continued relevance and effectiveness: key key

 determining the level of human involvement in ai- augmented decision-making . this section is intended to help organisations determine the appropriate extent of human   oversight in al-augmented decision-making: . having clarity on the objective of using al is a first step in determining the extent of human oversight: organisations can start by deciding on their commercial objectives of using al ensuring consistency in decision-making, improving operational efficiency and reducing costs, or introducing new product features to increase consumer choice): these commercial objectives can then be weighed against the risks of using al in the organisation's decision-making: this assessment should be guided by organisations' corporate values, which in turn, could reflect the societal norms or expectations of the territories in which the organisations operate. before deploying al solutions, organisations should decide on their commercial objectives of using al, and then weigh them against the risks of using al in the organisation's decision-making: . it is also desirable for organisations operating in multiple countries to consider the differences in societal norms, values and/or expectations, where possible. forexample, gaming advertisements may be acceptable in one country but not in another: even within a country, risks may vary significantly depending on where al is deployed: for example, risks to individuals associated with recommendation engines that promote products in an online mall or automating the approval of online applications for travel insurance may be lower than the risks associated with algorithmic trading facilities offered to sophisticated investors. key (e.g:



model artificial intelligence governance framework  . some risks to individuals may only manifest at group level: for example, widespread adoption of a stock recommendation algorithm might cause herding behaviour; increasing overall market volatility if sufficiently large numbers of individuals make similar decisions atthe same time. in addition to risks to individuals, other types of risks may also be identified risk to an organisation's commercial reputation): . organisations' weighing of their commercial objectives against the risks of using al should ideally be guided by their corporate values. organisations can assess if the intended al deployment and the selected model for algorithmic decision-making are consistent with their own core values: inconsistencies and deviations should be conscious decisions made by organisations with a clearly defined and documented rationale. . as identifying commercial objectives, risks and determining the appropriate level of human involvement in al-augmented decision-making is an iterative and ongoing process, it is desirable for organisations to continually identify and review risks relevant to their technology solutions, mitigate those risks, and maintain a response plan should mitigation fail. documenting this   process   through a periodically reviewed risk impact assessment helps organisations develop clarity and confidence in using the al solutions: it will also help organisations respond to potential challenges from individuals, other organisations or businesses, and regulators (e.g. any



 what are the three broad approaches of human involvement in ai-augmented decision-making? . based on the risk management approach described above, the model framework identifies three broad approaches to classify the various degrees of human oversight in the decision-making process: a human-in-the-loop suggests that human oversight is active and involved, with the human retaining full controlandthe al only providing recommendations or input: decisions cannot be exercised without affirmative actions by the human, such as a human command to proceed with a given decision. for example, a doctor may use al to identify possible diagnoses of and treatments for an unfamiliar medical condition. however; the doctor will make the final decision on the diagnosis and the corresponding treatment: this model requires al to provide enough information for the human to make an informed decision (e.g. factors that are used in the decision, their value and weighting, correlations): b human-out-of-the-loop suggests that there is no human oversight over the execution of decisions the al system has full control without the option of human override. for example, a product recommendation solution may automatically suggest products and services to individuals based on pre-determined demographic and behavioural profiles al can also dynamically create new profiles, then make product and service suggestions rather than relying on predetermined categories. machine learning model might also be used by an airline to forecast demand or likely disruptions, and the outputs of this model are used by a solver module to optimise the airline's scheduling, without a human in the c human-over-the-loop (orhuman-on-the-loop) suggests that human oversight is involved to the extent that the human is in a monitoring or supervisory role, with the ability to take over control when the al model encounters unexpected or undesirable events (such as model failure). this approach allows humans to adjust parameters during the operation of the algorithm. for example, a gps navigation system plans the route from point a to point b, offering several possible routes for the driver to pick the driver can alter parameters (e.g: due to unforeseen road congestions) during the trip without having to re-programme the route. loop.



model artificial intelligence governance framework  . the model framework also proposes a design framework (structured as a matrix) to help organisations determine the level ofhuman involvement required in al-augmented decision-making: this design framework is structured two axes: the (a) probability; and (b) severity ofharm to an individual (or organisation) as a result of the decision made by an organisation about that individual (or organisation): . the definition of harm and the computation of probability and severity will depend on the context and vary from sector to sector: for example, the considerations of a hospital regarding the harm associated with a wrong diagnosis of a patients medical condition will differ from the considerations of a clothing store's regarding the harm associated with a wrong product recommendation for apparels. hieh severity high severity l low probability high probability ""  low severity low severity low probability high probability probability of harm . the matrix, however; should not be taken to imply that the probability of harm and severity of harm are the only factors to be considered in determining the level ofhuman oversight in an organisation's decision-making process involving al (although are generally two of the more important factors) c . for safety-critical systems, it would be prudent for organisations to ensure that a person be allowed to assume control, with the al system providing sufficient information for that person to make meaningful decisions or to safely shut down the system where human control is not possible. other factors that organisations in various contexts may consider relevant; could also include: (a) the nature of harm (i.e: whether the harm is physical or intangible in nature); (b) the reversibility of harm, and as a corollary to this, the ability for individuals to obtain recourse; and (c) whether it is operationally feasible or meaningful for a human to be involved in decision-making process having human-in-the-loop would be unfeasible in high- financial trading, and be impractical in the case of driverless vehicles) along they (e.g. speed



 using the probability-severity of harm matrix an online retail store wishes to use al to fully automate the recommendation of food products to individuals based highly on their browsing behaviours and purchase histories. the recommended! automation will meet the organisation's commercial objective of operational efficiency: probability-severity assessment the definition of harm can be the impact of making product recommendations that do not address the perceived needs of the individuals. the severity of harm in making the wrong product recommendations to individuals may be low since individuals ultimately decide whether to make the purchase: the probability of harm may be high or low depending on the efficiency and efficacy of the al solution. degree of human intervention in decision-making process given the low severity of harm, the assessment to an approach that requires no human intervention (i.e: human-out-of-the-loop): high severity high severity ! low probability high probability "" low severity low severity  low probability high probability lumameout ofethe-loop probability of harm regular review the organisation regularly reviews its approach (i.e. human-out-of-the-loop) to re-assess the severity and probability of harm, and as societal norms and values evolve. note: this is a simple illustration using bright-line norms and values. organisations can consider testing this method of determining the al decision-making model against cases with more challenging and complex ethical dilemmas. points

model artificial intelligence governance framework  operations management . this section is intended to help organisations adopt responsible measures in the operations aspect of their al adoption process: reference al adoption process is set out in order to provide a context for the recommendations for good governance in respect of the organisation's data, algorithm and al model. . the model framework uses the following generalised al model development and deployment process to describe phases in implementing an al solution by an organisation. it should be noted that this process is not always uni-directional _ it can, and usually is, a continuous process of learning: data preparation algorithms chosen model stage : stage : stage : raw data is formatted models are trained on the chosen model is and cleansed so the dataset and used to produce conclusions can be algorithms may be probability scores that drawn accurately: this includes can be incorporated generally; accuracy and statistical or machine into applications to insights increase with learning models offer predictions, make relevance and the including decision trees decisions, solve amount of data_ and neural networks_ the problems and trigger results are examined and actions. models are iterated until the most appropriate model emerges_ machine learning algorithms raw data data pre- prepared apply candidate chosen processing data algorithms model model raw and/or train data al model application iterate until data is ready iterate for most appropriate model adapted from machine learning at scale microsoft azure ( december )  (accessed december ). applied.



 . during   deployment; algorithms such as linear   regression algorithms, decision trees, or neural networks are for analysis on training datasets. the resulting algorithmic models are examined and algorithms are iterated until a model that produces the most appropriate results for the use case emerges this model and its results are then incorporated into applications to offer predictions, make decisions, solve problems and trigger actions. the intimate interaction between data and algorithm/ model is the focus of this part of the model framework data for model development . datasets used for building models may come from multiple sources, and could include both personal and non-personal data. the quality and selection of data from each of these sources are critical to the success of an al solution: if a model is built using biased, inaccurate or non-representative  data, the risks of unintended discriminatory decisions from the model will increase. to ensure the effectiveness of an al solution, relevant departments within the organisation with responsibilities over quality of data, model training and model selection must work together to put in place data accountability practices. . the persons who are involved in training and selecting models for deployment may be internal staff or external service providers it is ideal for the models deployed in an intelligent to have an internal departmental owner; who will be the one making decisions on which models to deploy: to ensure the effectiveness of an al solution, it would be helpful for relevant departments within the organisation with responsibilities over quality of data, model training and model selection to work together to put in place good data accountability practices. these include the following: applied good system



model artificial intelligence governance framework  a  understanding the lineage of data: this means knowing where the data originally came from, how it was collected, curated and moved within the organisation, and how its accuracy is maintained over time. data lineage can be represented visually to trace how the data moves from its source to its destination, how the data transformed along the way; where itinteracts with other data, and how the representations change: there are three types of data lineage: backward data lineage looks at the data from its end-use and backdating it to its source. ii. forward data lineage begins at the data's source and follows it through to its end-use. iii. end-to-end data lineage combines the two and looks at the entire solution from both the data's source to its end-use and from its end-use to its source. keeping a data provenance record allows an organisation to ascertain the quality of the data based on its origin and subsequent transformation, trace potential sources of errors, data, and attribute data to their sources: in some instances, the origin of  data could be difficult to establish. one example could be datasets obtained from a trusted third-party which may have commingled data from multiple sources: it would be prudent for organisations to assess the risks of using such data and manage them accordingly: gets update



 b ensuring data quality: organisations are encouraged to understand and address factors that may affect the quality of data, such as: the accuracy of the dataset, in terms of how well the values in the dataset match the true characteristics of the entities described by the dataset; ii. the completeness of the dataset, both in terms of attributes and items; iii. the veracity of the dataset, which refers to how credible the data is, including whether the data originated from a reliable source; iv. how recently the dataset was compiled or updated; the relevance of the dataset and the context for data collection, as it may affect the interpretation of and reliance on the data for the intended purpose; vi. the integrity of the dataset that has been joined from multiple datasets, which refers to how well extraction and transformation have been performed; vii. the usability of the dataset; including how well the dataset is structured in a machine- understandable and viii. human interventions ifany human has filtered, labels, or edited the data): minimising inherent bias: there are many types of bias relevant to ai: the model framework focuses on inherent bias in datasets, which may lead to undesired outcomes such as unintended discriminatory decisions. organisations should be aware that the data which provide to al systems could contain inherent biases and are encouraged to take steps to mitigate such bias. the two common types of bias in data include: form; (e.g: applied they



model artificial intelligence governance framework  selection bias: this bias occurs when the data used to produce the model are not fully representative of the actual data or environment thatthe model may receive or function in. common examples of selection bias in datasets are omission bias and stereotype bias. omission bias describes the omission of certain characteristics from the dataset: for example, a dataset consisting only of asian faces will exhibit omission bias ifit is used for facial recognition training for a population that includes non-asians: a dataset of vehicle types within the central business district on a weekday may exhibit stereotype bias weighted in favour of cars, buses and motorcycles but under-represent bicycles if it is used to model the  types of transportation available in singapore: ti. measurement bias: this bias occurs when the data collection device causes the data to be systematically skewed in a particular direction. for example, the training data could be obtained using camera with a colour filter that has been turned off, thereby skewing the machine learning result: while identifying and addressing inherent bias in datasets may not be easy, organisations can mitigate the risk of inherent bias by having a heterogeneous dataset (i.e. collecting data from a variety of reliable sources): another way is to ensure the dataset is as complete as possible, both from the perspective of data attributes and data items premature removal of data attributes can make it difficult to identify and address inherent bias.



 d. different datasets for training; testing; and validation: different datasets are required for training, testing, and validation. the model is trained using the training data , while the model's accuracy is determined using the test data. where applicable, the model could also be checked for systematic bias by testing it on different demographic groups to observe whether any groups are being systematically advantaged or disadvantaged: finally, the trained model can be validated using the validation dataset: it is considered good practice to split a large dataset into subsets for these purposes, if it does not lead to a significant reduction in the quality of data in terms of accuracy and representation. however; where this is not possible (e.g: if the organisation is not working with large datasets or are using pre-trained models as in the case of transfer learning), organisations are encouraged to be cognisant of the risks of systematic bias and in  place appropriate safeguards. periodic reviewing and updating of datasets: it would be prudent for datasets (including training, testing, and validation datasets) to be reviewed periodically to ensure accuracy,  quality,  currency, relevance and reliability: where necessary, the datasets can be updated with new input data obtained from actual use of the al models deployed in production. when such new input data is used, organisations need to be aware of potential bias as using new input data that has already gone through a model once could create a reinforcement bias. . even if only non-personal data are used for the training of al models (including personal data that has been anonymised) , the data accountability practices above remain relevant: put good



model artificial intelligence governance framework  suade labs: illustration on managing data for model development suade (introduced above) has developed an al-enabled solution that financial institutions generate the required data and reports to comply with regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions where operate: as the data used for suade's al model development directly affects its quality and performance, suade has adopted several good data accountability practices: for example, to ensure that regulatory data comes from a credible and reliable source  suade obtains and updates regulatory data only from the relevant regulators in addition, suade tags the datasets used with additional metadata. this allows suade to trace datasets back to their original source when needed, such as where inconsistencies are found. further; in order to trace which particular datasets were used in an al model, suade also documents and stores such information pertaining to model development on its database. suade also minimises the inherent risks of al models through responsible data tagging: by using a larger number of taggers (i.e. people who tag data), suade aims to make the output of its al models as neutral as possible, and reduce the risk of its taggers being influenced by the context ofthe data (which often comprise of text) are annotating: in other words, suade uses as many individuals as practicable to tag data to reduce the risk of tagger bias. in addition, suade developed a tagging system to facilitate the annotation of data: this system is used to generate training data used by the algorithm. suade will further develop this tagging system to enhance its ability to manage multiple annotators and to better select datasets used for model training: suade also periodically updates the tagging system with new data. new training data is subsequently fed repeatedly back into the al model. this way, the al model is able to continuously learn from new sets of data. another data accountability practice that suade adopts is the use of validation schema checks at various stages of data transformation: this is a process in which suade verifies that the data schema accurately represents the data from the source, to ensure that there are no errors in factors such as the data's formatting and content: helps they they



 pymetrics: illustration on managing biases in datasets for model development pymetrics is a technology provider that uses neuroscience insights and audited al models to help evaluate applicants in a more predictive and less biased manner: to develop an al model, pymetrics: gets its   clients' top-performing employees to go through pymetrics' assessments, and builds a trait of an employee that best fit the specific job role; validates the trait profile with the clients hr team; and collects behavioural data of applicants  through  pymetrics'   gamified assessments, and assesses the suitability of the applicants based on the trait profile. to deal with socially sensitive features and mitigate the risk of inherent or unintentional bias in the datasets used by the al model, pymetrics: uses objective data based on established neuroscience research attention to detail, attention span and ability to recall) , which are generally stable across gender; racial and age groups. proactively de-biases all al models to ensure that are fully representative of the environment that may function in, so that the al models do not disadvantage   people on the basis of their   demographic features: the standards for fairness are informed by legal requirements as a pre- hire assessment; pymetrics models must pass a test known as the four- fifths rule""_ which is commonly cited in employment law. according to us' equal employment opportunity commission (""eeoc"") , the selection rate for any legally protected group must be at least % of the selection rate for the majority group. for example, if an employer screens  qualified applicants ( men and  women), a model that selects  men must also select at least  women: pymetrics will test the al model against a dataset of users from diverse demographics to ensure that random patterns in the data are not learned by the model and to address any potential for bias. profile (e.g: they they



model artificial intelligence governance framework  pymetrics would conduct further de-biasing on additional demographic based on geographical relevance or legal requirements: pymetrics uses a bias ratio to compare the proportional pass rates of the highest-passing demographic group with the lowest-passing group for each demographic category (e.g: gender and ethnicity). the al model would be deployed only if meet the eeoc standards. after al deployment; pymetrics: will test the al model's decisions on real applicants for adverse impact; and revisits the long-term impact of its system's predictions on retention for the role. if bias is found either before or after deployment, pymetrics will adjust the al modelto optimise for fairness towards while ensuring the predictive performance of the al model: algorithm and model . al systems may have numerous features or functionalities enabled through algorithms in al models. measures such as explainability, repeatability, robustness, regular reproducibility, traceability, and auditability can enhance the transparency of algorithms found in al models. it may not be feasible or cost- effective to implement even the most essential ofthese measures for all algorithms: organisations are encouraged to take a risk-based approach in making a two-fold assessment: first, identify the subset of features or functionalities that have the greatest impact on stakeholders for which such measures are relevant. second, identify which of these measures will be most effective in building trust with their  stakeholders: some of these measures like explainability (or repeatability, when using models that are not easily explained) , robustness and regular tuning are sufficiently essential that could, to varying extents, be incorporated as part of the organisation's al deployment process. other measures, such as reproducibility, traceability and auditability are more resource-intensive and may be relevant for features or in specific scenarios. they applicants tuning, they specific



 explainability . explainability is achieved by explaining how deployed al models' algorithms function and/or how the decision-making process incorporates model predictions: the purpose of being able to explain predictions made by al is to build understanding and trust: an algorithm deployed in an al solution is said to be explainable if how it functions and how it arrives at a particular prediction can be explained: when an algorithm cannot be explained, understanding and trust can still be built by explaining how predictions play a role in the decision-making process: . organisations deploying al solutions are recommended to adopt the following practices: a_ model training and selection are necessary for developing an intelligent system (i.e. a system that contains al technologies). documenting how the model training and selection processes are conducted, the reasons for which decisions are made, and measures taken to address identified risks will enable the organisation to provide an account of the decisions subsequently: in this regard, the field of automated machine learning aims to automate a significant portion of machine learning workflows, including feature  engineering, feature selection, model selection and hyper-parameter tuning: organisations using these types of tools can consider the transparency; explainability and traceability of the automated machine learning approach, as well as the models selected. b incorporating descriptions of the solutions' design and expected behaviour into product or service descriptions and system technical specifications documentation demonstrates   accountability to individuals andlor regulators. this could also include design decisions in relation to why certain features, attributes or models are selected in place of others. these steps can help provide greater clarity on an al model by giving understandable and digestible insights into how the model operates:



model artificial intelligence governance framework  where an organisation's al system was obtained or procured from a third-party al solution provider; the organisation can consider requesting assistance from the al solution provider as may be better placed to explain how the solution functions. c supplementary   explanation tools are helpful for explaining al models; especially models that are less interpretable (also known as black box"" systems): these tools help make the underlying rationale of an al system's output more interpretable and intelligible to those who use the system. it is possible to use a combination of these tools to improve the explainability of an al model's decision: . technical explainability may not always be enlightening, especially to the man on the street: implicit explanations of how the al models' algorithms function may be more useful than explicit descriptions of the models' logic for example, providing an individual with counterfactuals (such as you would have been approved if your average debt was % lower"") andlor comparisons (such as these are users with similar profiles to yours that received a similar decision"") can be a powerful type of explanation that organisations could consider: . nevertheless, there may be scenarios where it might not be practical or reasonable to provide information in relation to an algorithm. for example, disclosing algorithms deployed for anti- money laundering detection, information security, and fraud prevention may allow bad actors to avoid detection; likewise , providing detailed information about proprietary algorithms or the decisions made by the algorithms may expose confidential business information. these tools are known as supplementary' as there is at present no single comprehensive technical solution for making al models explainable. these tools thus play a supplementary role in providing some level of interpretability on an al model's operation. examples of these tools include the use of surrogate models, partial dependence plots, global variable importancelinteraction, sensitivity analysis, counterfactual explanations, or self-explaining and attention-based systems_ they



 repeatability . where explainability cannot practicably be achieved given the state of technology, organisations can consider documenting the repeatability of results produced by the al model. repeatability refers to the ability to consistently perform an action or make a decision, given the same scenario. while repeatability (of results) is not equivalent to explainability (of algorithm) , some degree of assurance of consistency in performance could provide al users with a larger degree of confidence. helpful practices include: a conducting repeatability assessments for commercial deployments in live environments to ensure that deployments are repeatable; b performing counterfactual fairness testing: counterfactual fairness testing ensures that a model's decisions are the same in both the real world and in a counterfactual world where attributes deemed sensitive (such as race or gender) are altered; c assessing how exceptions can be identified and handled when decisions are not repeatable, e.g: when randomness has been introduced by design; d. ensuring   exception   handling is in line with organisations' policies; in this regard, it may be helpful to use al models that are able to recognise when a given set of facts contains new variables not previously considered and are able to highlight these new variables to a human; e identifying and accounting for changes over time to ensure that models trained on time-sensitive data remain relevant: james manyika , jake sitberg, and brittany presten, ""what do we do about the biases in al?"" harvard business review ( october )  (accessed  october ).



model artificial intelligence governance framework  robustness . robustness refers to the ability of a computer system to cope with errors during execution and erroneous input, and is assessed by the degree to which a system or component can function correctly in the presence of invalid input or stressful environmental conditions. ensuring that deployed models are sufficiently robust will contribute towards building trust in the al system. . the concept of robustness arises because it is not possible for models to be able to enumerate and set out all preconditions and consequences for an action. this creates the possibility of models producing insensible or unexpected results even with minor modifications to input data (thatmay not even be perceptible to humans) testing for robustness can be achieved through scenario-based testing for foreseeable erroneous input  to ensure that models are more robust, organisations can consider working with al developers to conduct adversarial testing on their models to ensure that their models are able to handle a broader range of unexpected input variables (especially for public-facing al systems). as this is a resource-intensive exercise , organisations can take a risk-based approach towards identifying the subset of al-powered features in their products or services that requires adversarial testing: . no model can be perfectly robust as it is not possible to detect all possible modifications to a set of input data. for this reason, organisations intending to use continual learning (i.e: where the learned parameters of a machine learning model are not fixed but the model continues to change its learned parameters after being deployed into production) are encouraged to be aware of the risks of doing so, should the continual learning model behave in an unpredictable manner this is distinct from user acceptance testing (""uat"") , which is process where actual software users test piece of software to ensure that it can handle required tasks in real- world scenarios, based on specifications uat is often critical step that is taken before newly-developed software is released to the market:



 regular tuning . establishing an internal policy and process to perform regular model tuning is effective for ensuring that deployed models cater for changes to customer behaviour over time. this allows organisations to refresh models based on updated training datasets that incorporate new input data. model tuning may also be necessary when commercial objectives, risks, or corporate values change. . wherever possible, testing should reflect the dynamism of the planned production environment: to ensure safety, testing may need to assess the degree to which an al solution generalises well and fails gracefully: for example, a warehouse robot tasked with avoiding obstacles to complete a task picking up packages) could be tested with different types of obstacles and realistically varied internal environments workers wearing a variety of different coloured shirts). otherwise, models risk learning regularities in the environment that do not reflect actual production environment conditions assuming that all humans that it must avoid will be wearing white lab coats). once al models are deployed in the real-world environment; active monitoring, review and tuning are advised. traceability . an al model is considered to be traceable if (a) its decisions, and (b) the datasets and processes that the al model's decision (including those of data gathering, data labelling and the algorithms used) , are documented in an easily understandable way: the former refers to traceability of al-augmented decisions, while the latter refers to traceability in model training: traceability facilitates transparency and explainability, and is also helpful for other reasons. first, the information might also be useful for troubleshooting, or for an investigation into how the model was functioning or why a particular prediction was made. second, the traceability record (in the form ofan audit log) can be a source of input data that can be used as a training dataset in the future. (e.g: (e.g. (e.g: yield



model artificial intelligence governance framework  . practices that organisations may consider to promote traceability include: a building an audit trail to document the model training and al-augmented decision. b. implementing a black box recorder that captures all input data streams. for example, a black box recorder in a driving car tracks the vehicle's position and records when and where the self-driving system takes control of the vehicle, suffers a technical problem or requests the driver to take over the control of the vehicle. c= ensuring that data relevant to traceability are stored appropriately to avoid degradation or alteration, and retained for durations relevant to the industry: . as traceability measures may lead to an accumulation of a large volume of activity data, organisations can consider which oftheir product features   require   traceability and which  traceability measures might be sufficient for their needs, bearing in mind the resources needed to document the al model's decisions, datasets and processes. organisations could assess this based on several factors, including: a their assessment of the probability andlor severity of harm arising from the use of the al system; bs the extent to which the al model had previously been trialled or used; and c the regulatory needs of their industry: it should be noted that black box recorder does not refer to ""black box in the al model sense (i.e. where the decision-making process of an al model is inherently difficult to interpret and explain). self_



 reproducibility . while repeatability refers to the internal repetition of results within ones organisation, reproducibility refers to the ability of an independent verification team to produce the same results using the same al method based on the documentation made by the organisation. reproducibility can influence the trustworthiness of the al product and the organisation deploying the al model. as implementing  reproducibility entails the involvement of external parties, organisations can take a risk-based approach towards identifying the subset of al-powered features in their products or services that requires external reproducibility testing: . the following practices contribute towards reproducibility: a_ testing whether  specific   contexts or particular conditions would need to be taken into account to ensure reproducibility; b. putting in place verification methods to ensure different aspects of the al models reliability and reproducibility; c making available replication files (.e. files that replicate each step of the al models developmental process) to facilitate the process of testing and reproducing behaviours; d. for companies that procure commercial off-the-shelf al systems, checking with the original al solution provider about whether the model's results are reproducible; and adopting in paragraph . (c)-(e) under repeatability (namely, assessing how exceptions can be identified and handled, ensuring that exception- handling is in line with organisational policies, and identifying and accounting for changes over time). points



model artificial intelligence governance framework  auditability . auditability refers to the readiness of an al system to undergo an assessment of its algorithms, data and design processes. the evaluation of the al system by internal or external auditors (and the availability of evaluation reports) can contribute to the trustworthiness of the al  system as it demonstrates the responsibility of design and practices and the justifiability of outcomes: it should, however; be noted that auditability does not necessarily entail making information about business models or intellectual property related to the al system publicly available: . implementing auditability not only entails the involvement of external parties but requires disclosure of commercially sensitive information to the auditors, who may be external. organisations can take a risk-based approach towards identifying the subset of al-powered features in their products or services for which implementing auditability is necessary, or where implementing auditability is necessary for an organisation to align itself with regulatory requirements or industry practice. . to facilitate auditability, organisations can consider keeping a comprehensive record of data provenance, procurement, pre- processing, lineage, storage and security: the record could also include   qualitative  input about data   representations, data sufficiency, source integrity, data timelines, data relevance, and unforeseen data issues encountered across the workflow: . organisations may also wish to centralise such information digitally in a process this would enable the organisation to make available, in one place, information that may assistin demonstrating to concerned parties and affected decision subjects both the responsibility of design and practices and the justifiability of the outcomes of your system's processing behaviour: such a would also enable better organisation of the accessibility and presentation of information yielded, assist in the curation and protection of data that should be kept unavailable from view, and increase the organisation's capacity to cater the presentation of results to different tiers of stakeholders with different interests and levels of expertise. log: log public



 symphony ayasdiai: illustration on documenting model development symphony ayasdiai (""ayasdi"") offers a solution that helps its clients, mainly in the us banking and finance sector; to build al models that can adequately forecast revenues and the capital reserve required to absorb losses under stressed economic conditions. its clients need to prove to the us federal reserve that their al models are accurate and defensible. the solution - ayasdi's model accelerator (the ama"") - first identifies relevant variables to include in the model and then why they are selected: ama does this by looking at possible relationships encoded within the enriched base-level data, and finding hidden patterns that hold predictive value: the ama then uses the variables selected to build al models: it presents a candidate model and several viable challenger models for the clients' selection. business units within the clients"" organisations will evaluate the candidate and challenger models and select those that best represent their business units. the entire model creation process is documented automatically: the clients can use ama to institutionalise both their variable selection and modelling methodology, systematically and deterministically; to produce a repeatable process with consistent supporting reports on model lineage, variable selection and cross-validation. this allows the clients to ensure that initial selections of features and models are recorded and documented: at the same time, the entire modelling and approval process is tracked and catalogued, thus facilitating subsequent processes from review to model re-use: the ability to demonstrate the detailed process of model building and the rigour of evaluating challenger models allows ayasdi's clients to explain to the us federal reserve how their final models are selected: explains



model artificial intelligence governance framework  stakeholder interaction and communication  . this section is intended to help organisations take appropriate steps to build trust in the stakeholder relationship strategies when deploying ai. general disclosure . organisations are encouraged to provide general information on whether al is used in their products and/or services. where appropriate, this could include information on what al is, how al is used in decision-making in relation to consumers, what are its benefits, why your organisation has decided to use al, how your organisation has taken steps to mitigate risks, and the role and extent that al plays in the decision-making process. for example, an online portal may inform its users that are interacting with an al-powered chatbot and not a human customer service agent: . organisations can consider disclosing the manner in which an al decision may affect an individual consumer; and whether the decision is reversible. for example, an organisation may inform the individuals that their credit ratings may lead to a loan refusal not only from this organisation but also from other  similar organisations, while also informing them that such a decision is reversible if individuals can provide more evidence on their credit worthiness. policy for explanation . organisations are encouraged to develop a policy on what explanations to provide to individuals and when to provide them. such policies help ensure consistency in communication, and clearly sets out roles and responsibilities of different members of your organisation. these can include explanations on how ai works in an al-augmented decision-making process, how a specific decision was made and the reasons behind that decision, and the impact and consequence of the decision. the explanation can be provided as part of general communication: it can also be information in respect of a decision upon request: in this regard, the principle of equivalence can provide some guidance such that the same standards of disclosure forhuman- driven decisions is applied to decisions that have been made or augmented by an al system. they specific



 bringing explainability and transparency together in a meaningful way . appropriate interaction and communication inspire trust and confidence as build and maintain open relationships between organisations and individuals (including employees) . stakeholder relationship strategies should also not remain static. companies are encouraged to test, evaluate and review their strategies for effectiveness: further; the extent and mode of implementation of these factors could vary from scenario to scenario. . as different stakeholders have different information needs, an organisation can start by first identifying its audience (i.e: its external and internal stakeholders). an organisation's external stakeholders may include consumers, regulators, other organisations it does business with, and society at large. its internal  stakeholders may include the organisation's board, management and employees. an organisation can also consider the purpose and the context of the interaction with its stakeholders. for the purposes of  illustration, this model framework provides considerations for interacting with consumers and other organisations: as different stakeholders have different information needs, an organisation can start by first identifying its audience and considering the purpose and the context of the interaction. interacting with consumers . organisations are encouraged to consider the information needs of consumers as go through the journey of interacting with al , from considering whether to use an al solution, to understanding how the al solution works as they use it, to requesting for reviews on the decisions made by the al solution: a typical consumer journey may entail meeting the following information needs of consumers: they they



model artificial intelligence governance framework  a making sure that consumers are aware that the products or services that are considering are al-enabled. such information could be provided as part of a general product description. b providing information so that consumers know how the al-enabled features are expected to behave during normal use_ the information could be provided in more detailed descriptions or specifications of product features. this, however; may not be necessary for every feature that is al-enabled: organisations are encouraged to identify those features where providing additional information in this manner will enhance consumer trust. similarly, if al is used in decision-making, information may be provided so that consumers understand how decisions made with the assistance of al may affect them. this can likewise be provided through descriptions of how the service will be provided: for al-enabled features that consumers interact with regularly, providing information so that understand why the al-enabled feature is behaving in a certain way, and providing preference settings to allow consumers some influence over future behaviour where possible. as doing so requires more engineering effort (such as in the providing additional user interfaces to user history), and the level of information provided may be somewhat more detailed and personalised than feature descriptions, organisations will have to decide which of their product features will benefit from provision of this level of detail: d. for al-augmented decisions that affect consumers, consider providing additional information so that understand why the decisions were made; and for certain categories of such decisions, providing an appropriate channel to contest such decisions: the level of information that is provided will necessarily be detailed but this may not be necessary except for those scenarios where a customer is affected by the decision: they they they

model artificial intelligence governance framework  a feedback channels this channel could be used for customers to raise feedback or raise queries: it could be managed by an organisation's data protection officer (""dpo"") if this is appropriate. where customers find inaccuracies in their personal data which has been used for decisions affecting them, this channel can also allow them to correct their data such correction and feedback, in turn, maintain data veracity: it could also be managed by an organisation's   quality service manager  (""qsm"") if stakeholders wish to raise feedback and queries on material inferences made about them: b_ decision review apart from existing review channels obligations, organisations can consider providing an avenue for individuals (such as an aggrieved consumer) to request a review of material al decisions that have affected them: where the effect of a fully-autonomous decision on a consumer may be material, it would be reasonable to provide an opportunity for the decision to be reviewed by a human: testing the user interface . organisations are encouraged to test user interfaces and address usability problems before deployment, so that the user interface serves its intended purposes: if applicable, organisations are also encouraged to inform individuals that their responses would be used to train the al system a chatbot) organisations should be aware of the risks of using such responses as some individuals may intentionally use bad language or random replies' which would affect the training of the al system: easy-to-understand communications . organisations are encouraged to communicate in an easy-to- understand manner to increase transparency: there are existing tools to measure readability, such as the readability graph , the gunning index, the flesch-kincaid readability tests, etc: it would be helpful for decisions with higher impact to be communicated in an easy-to-understand manner; with the need to be transparent about the technology being used: besides textual communications, organisations can also consider visualisation tools, graphical representations, summary tables, or a combination of these. the  priority is to convey your information, such as an explanation or interpretation, in a way that is understandable by an organisation's consumers and other stakeholders. (e.g. fry fog using



 acceptable user policies . in certain cases, organisations may be implementing al-powered solutions that are also trained on real-life input data (i.e. active learning). these organisations may wish to consider setting out certain acceptable user policies (""aups"") to ensure that users do not   maliciously introduce  input data that unacceptably manipulates the performance andlor results of the solution's model: this is pertinent, given examples of al chatbot systems that have been unduly manipulated to issue publicly- unacceptable responses. . in this regard, aups serve to set broad boundaries for the interactions that individuals can perform with the al system, such as restrictions with regard to intentional actions or attempts to reverse engineer; disable, interfere or disrupt the functionality, integrity or performance of the al-powered service. interacting with other organisations . some of the approaches and methodologies described in the preceding section are also relevant when organisations interact with al solution providers (such as procuring al solutions and obtaining regulatory approval) , or other organisations (such as facilitating industry collaboration, enabling interoperability of systems). organisations would thus need to obtain sufficient information from al solution providers to help them meet their business objectives (for example, this could be a back-to-back arrangement for providing the information described in paragraph .). this could be as straightforward as obtaining the al solution providers' support to provide the information"" and to build the features"" necessary such that the deploying organisation can align itself to the model framework: for example, information related to lineage of the training dataset and documenting the steps in the model training and selection process for example, the user-facing interactions providing information about the expected behavior of an al-powered feature and building the function to allow users to manage preference settings that influence how the al-powered feature will perform for them in future: past key



model artificial intelligence governance framework  . organisations may have to consider the level of support and detailed information that may need to obtain from al solution providers pertaining to: a data (e.g: types and range of data used in training the algorithm, source and quality of external training data); b model training and selection (e.g. features and variables used and weights of the commercial models supplied, documenting the decisions made with respect to the model training and selection); c human elements nature of human involvement in developing the algorithm, or in the decision-making process); d. inferences (e.g: predictions made by the algorithm and how these are incorporated into product features or decision- making); e algorithmic presence (e.g: where in the solution that an algorithm is used); and f measures and safeguards in place to mitigate biases in data and algorithms: . depending on the purpose and context, the type and level of detail of information required may be different: for example, a regulator may require a regulated entity to demonstrate that its model development and selection process is sufficiently rigorous, and the al solution provider may be required to provide more information and be involved in the clarification process with the regulator: an industry collaborator; on the hand, may be more concerned with factors pertaining to compatibility and interoperability: ethical evaluation . finally, as ethical standards governing the development and use of al evolve, organisations are encouraged to evaluate whether their al governance practices and processes are in with evolving al standards, and make available the outcome of such evaluations to relevant stakeholders: they key (e.g: line

summary with the update of the artificial intelligence strategy, the federal government is focusing its measures with regard to current developments in the field of artificial intelligence (al) since the strategy was adopted in november . the aims to strengthen  germany as an internationally competitive centre of al research, development and application: this entails further establishing and expanding al ecosystems! in germany and europe to strengthen the application of al on a broad scale and at the same time to promote the visibility of outstanding initiatives and structures responsible and public good-oriented development and application of ai systems should be made an integral part and thus a trademark of an ""al made in europe' in addition to this, the update puts pandemic control, sustainability in particular environmental and climate protection and international and european networking at the heart of new initiatives. achieving this entails training, attracting and retaining more al specialists in germany, establishing powerful and internationally visible research structures and, in particular, providing internationally competitive cutting-edge al and computing infrastructures establishing al ecosystems with an international reach; based on excellent research and transfer structures, in  order to foster research results applied in business practice, especially in the sme sector or mittelstand, and to boost start-up dynamics, bolstering the underlying conditions for innovative and human-centric al applications in germany and europe by establishing and expanding the quality infrastructure into a system for safe, secure and trustworthy al on the basis of an appropriate regulatory framework; and supporting civil society networking and its involvement in the development and use of ai that serves the common al ecosystems are not meant here in the sense of a natural ecosystem:   update being good.



introduction artificial intelligence (ai)? is technology which harbours great potential for additional economic growth and productivity in germany, europe and worldwide. to promote and use this potential, the federal government developed a framework for action and adopted far- reaching measures in its artificial intelligence strategy (al strategy) these measures help shape holistic policy for responsible research, development and application of al in germany for the of citizens and the environment the federal government is basing this on a broad societal dialogue designed to enable societal actors to also contribute to shaping al,and on active policy- making: the guiding principle behind the al strategy is european ai ecosystem for innovation that enhances the competitiveness of european research, business and industry, promotes a wide range of different uses of al in all areas of society in the interest of citizens and is rooted in common european rules and values. when it comes to the development and use of ai, we will the benefits for people, the common good,the environment and the climate at the fore. the ai ecosystem consists of actors of different sizes across different sectors, connected across national borders, and enables everyone to participate this includes notjust science, research and business and industry, but also civil society as whole: the al ecosystem is designed to significantly enhance the appeal of germany ad europe as an internationally competitive centre of research and business germany and europe have the potential to create the world's largest data space for machinery, operational and mobility data furthermore; the al ecosystem will be based on a secure and sovereign data infrastructure; thus ensuring competitiveness the aim is also to give citizens the skills to be able to deal with al applications confidently in all manner of situations two years have passed since the publication of the al strategy in november  (chapter progress todate): much has happened during this time (chapter situation in ). with the update of the al strategy, the federal government is responding to these developments and supplementing them with further measures (chapter ai_strategy_priorities). here, current developments in response to the covid  pandemic and sustainability issues, in particular environmental and climate protection and european and internationalnetworking, play a major role. the update also sets out concrete steps for implementing the al strategy (chapter next steps in the_implementation of the al strategy): the present report is the product of seven thematic expert forums that were held with experts from the fields of business and industry, science; politics and society in the scope of updating the ai strategy. the main  subjects of the expert forums were research, transfer; industry ., mobility, healthcare and long-term care, environmental and climate   protection and the regulatory framework for the human-centric use of al at work and in society: in the expert forums, the experts were called upon to provide feedback on the progress made in implementing the ai strategy to date, to highlight new developments and make recommendations for action: for the definition see    key gains good put



dates of the german government's al strategy  november : cabinet adopts the al strategy: the website wwwki-strategie- deutschland de presents the strategy, measures and current developments   november : a_ year after the strategy was   first published, the federal government  publishes an interim_report providing information on individual measures to implement the strategy. june : with its future package, the government coalition decides to increase the planned expenditure of  billion euros for the promotion of al by an additional  billion euros to a total of  billion euros by . december : with its updated ai strategy, the federal government responds to new developments in the field of al and hones, strengthens and supplements its measures to foster al in germany and europe: progress to date since the publication of the al strategy, numerous initiatives ad measures to foster al have been implemented and many more have been initiated a year after the publication of the strategy, the federal  government published an interim  report  providing information on individual measures to implement the ai strategy: the experts in the expert forums for updating the ai strategy have stressed that,as an enabling technology, al needs to be used more commonly in the broadest range of fields of application than it has been to date this entails dovetailing and strengthening the relevant actors and initiatives and promoting the establishment and expansion of al ecosystems the expert forums for updating the ai strategy also indicated that the al strategy needed to hone in on the areas outlined below. ai research has been established in germany for a long time now and is well positioned: studies have found that germany ranks fifth internationally in terms of the number of scientific publications on al in recent years:. at the same time; the studies to very dynamic growth in ai research throughout the world, which must prompt germany to expand its research capacities if it is to keep up with international developments to durably enhance germany's appeal as a centre of al research, it will be key to establish visible research structures in the field of ai, as will broadly embedding al in the german research landscape the establishment of a national research consortium for al has already laid the foundation for an internationally prestigious research network that has a great development potential, particularly through the connection of various research areas according to the  report artificial intelligence: how knowledge is created, transferred and used"" by scientific publisher elsevier; germany ranks fifth internationally in terms of its number of scientific publications, behind china; the us, japan and uk in the al index , germany ranks fifth worldwide in terms of the number of scientific publications on al www_ ki-strategie-deutschland.de key key point



alongside companies, universities and research institutions are also competing internationally for highly trained al specialists and ai experts.  government talent promotion schemes specifically targeting al experts exist internationally: a recent study also demonstrates the demand for al workers:  % of the businesses using al in germany had vacancies in the field of ai in . out of these, were able to fill  % of the positions as planned, but  % were filled either late or not with the preferred staff; and  % of the positions remained vacant in light of this, strengthening al expertise in germany is of paramount importance for the german federal government: this encompasses a wide range of measures: from attracting leading ai experts from abroad, promoting  young scientists at germany's universities, initial and continuing education and training of workers all the way to empowering innovative regional small and medium-sized enterprises (smes) and embedding basic knowledge in broad sections of society. these measures need to be bolstered further and, in the interests of sustained effectiveness, established and expanded over an extended period of time in addition to making germany an attractive location for experts of international renown, there needs to be more targeted action to foster national talent in the context of its al strategy, the federal government has already actively promoted the transfer of findings from al research to the economy as well as the use of al across the breadth of sme sector and mittelstand"" . to remove barriers to the market and further cement trust and confidence in technologies, the federal government has expanded its information and advisory services for smes further and improved the business environment for start-ups in cooperation with science and business communities with special emphasis on smes, this has allowed the federal government to boost germany's position as an international centre of al innovation: the use of al in the fields of mobility, health; environment and agriculture were particular priorities here arecent study' shows that to date only around six per cent of the companies surveyed use ai,though: with the update of the al strategy,the federal governmentis therefore strengthening and expanding measures aimed at further reducing barriers to transfer and expanding support services ai-based products and services need to be as safe to use as any other product: the underlying conditions in place also play an important role in the development and use of al legal certainty and incentives for the development and deployment of secure and trustworthy al can reduce reservations and uncertainties among users and provide investment security for companies the federal government is   therefore advocating and working  towards suitable  regulatory framework, adapted to reflect al-specific issues if and where appropriate, within which the existing quality infrastructure is expanded and, if necessary, developed further: by setting clear rules,  standards, the fundamental rights of citizens can be protected, trust in ai can be strengthened, sustainable deployment of ai as well as innovation and competition can be promoted the implementation of the federal government's ai strategy to date has contributed to harness the innovative thrust associated with the development of ai for the benefit of the economy, science and society it has also led to the successful initiation of a more objective and factual discussion on the opportunities and risks harboured by ai, digital sovereignty and ethical aspects the federal government has also established new structures for monitoring the impact of al on work and society. the federal government will use this momentum to further promote sustainable and responsible development and application of ai for the good of citizens and to federal  ministry for economic affairs and energy () einsatz von ki in der deutschen wirtschaft (use of al in the german economy) www_ ki-strategie-deutschlandde  they



shape it together with them: this also goes hand in hand with greater promotion, involvement and networking of civil society projects and initiatives. monitoring the ai landscape to record trends and developments in the german; european and international al landscape and to then align and evaluate the implementation measures in the al strategy accordingly, the federal government compiles indicators these currently include indicators on the use of alin theeconomy in higher education and teaching, as well as on the number of al publications in international comparison and on society's perception of ai the indicators are constantly further developed and supplemented by indicators from other areas a study published in spring  on the ""use of artificial intelligence in the german economy"" provides the first overview of the current state of use of al in companies indicators are used to show in which sectors, to what extent and with what aims and objectives ai was used in . the study is part of a comprehensive research assignment on digitalisation commissioned by the federal government; for an initial period of three yearss there will continue to be more study reports on the use of ai in businesses in the future in the scope of the research project in order to assess the development and possible needs in the area of the use of al in the economy: furthermore, the federal government's observatory for_artificial intelligence_in work and society (ai observatory) will develop indicators that specifically record and evaluate the use of al in work and society. the al observatory organised a workshop for this purpose in  with experts from business, science, politics, social partners and civil society organisations to discuss the potential and challenges in developing suitable al indicators for the area of work and society and to start brainstorming on first concrete indicators these indicators will now be further developed with these experts the first indicators on alin work and society are scheduled to be published on the al observatory website in . the plattform lernende systeme also continuously analyses the use of ai in different areas in its working groups and discusses the opportunities, challenges and general conditions for the development and responsible use oflearning systems it uses these findings to develop scenarios, recommendations, policy options or roadmaps the platform also produces a mapon al showing current uses and projects, research institutions and transfer activities situation in  since november , when the federal government's artificial intelligence strategy was first adopted, there have been number of developments at both national and european and international level: the covid- pandemicin particular has presented people, our communities the project entitled measuring the degree of digitalisation of the german economy"" is being conducted by project consortium consisting of the zew leibniz-zentrum fur europaische wirtschaftsforschung gmbh mannheim (consortium leader), the institut der deutschen wirtschaft koln e.vs, the institut der deutschen wirtschaft koln consult gmbh, the forschungsinstitut fir rationalisierung e v. at the rwth aachen university and the deutsches institut fur wirtschaftsforschung e v. www_ ki-strategie-deutschland.de being may



and the economy with major and new challenges the potential al harbours for finding answers to these challenges must be harnessed. al can assist in the management of pandemics, for example in pandemic forecasting, monitoring and modelling the course of the epidemic or the effectiveness of different measures,and in research, inter alia in developing vaccines at the same time, ai technologies' use cases have increased in places due to side effects of the pandemic, for example through the increased use of purchase offers in online shops, the increasing use of al-based cybersecurity in the economy and to combat al-based disinformation and personalised phishing attacks by diffuse actors to strengthen germany in the fight against the covid- pandemic and to the foundations for germany's competitiveness during and after the pandemic; the federal government has significantly stepped up its commitment to future technologies like alonce again the economic stimulus and future_package will increase the federal government's investments in al from three to five billion euros by . these funds are to be used in particular to modernise the supercomputer infrastructure and increase computing capacities through new supercomputers, to promote the systematic digital provision of data from previously inaccessible data pools, to sustainably bolster ai centres of excellence and dovetail them with regional economy in application hubs, and to establish ai ecosystems of international appeal in order to the foundations for a european al network and the competitiveness of al ""made in europe"" in november ,the federal government published points ofa data strategy: within the framework  of broad public consultation and host of expert discussions, the federal governmentis now developing a data strategy aiming inter alia to increase the provision and use of data forall stakeholders responsibly and in compliance with data protection regulations data- driven innovations should thus be promoted the data strategy will address the issues of data availability and -infrastructures but even before the current pandemic and associated issues and questions arose, there had already been ai-specific developments in many areas: in germany, the commission of experts on competition law . presented its report on ""a new competition framework for the digital economy"" in  the competition and digitalisation act6 adopted by the cabinet on  september  addresses several of the commission'$s recommendations and   implements them where this   is essential to ensure functioning competition, for instance when it comes to improving access to data: the study commission on artificial intelligence - social responsibility and economic, social and ecological potential of the 19th german bundestag presented its final report with specific recommendations for action in october ,on which the german bundestag concluded its deliberations on  november: on  october , the data ethics commission presented report containing  recommendations for action on the use of data and algorithmic systems (including al systems) in , the german advisory council on global environmental change (wissenschaftlicher beirat der bundesregierung globale umweltveranderungen) also prepared its main report entitled towards our common digital future and two additional papers providing extensive analysis of the links between digitalisation and sustainability and listing recommendations for tenth act amending the act against restraints of competition for a focused, proactive and digital competition law .  many lay  lay key



action and research in specific policy areas various industry associations have also published recommendations for action for the policy towards ai: in december , the european commission published coordinated_plan_on artificial intelligence with   proposals for   specific measures for the european union   (eu) to be implemented through programmes from both the current and future multiannual financial framework (horizon , digital europe and horizon europe). member states are also called upon to make additional investments in this vein. on  april ,the high-level expert group on artificial  intelligence set up by the commission   published ethics guidelines for trustworthy ai' and on    june  policy and_investment_recommendations_for trustworthy al"". building on these, on  february  the commission presented its white paper on artificial intelligence - a european approachtoexcellenceand trust' the white paper sets out policy measures and options on the one hand to promote the use of al in the european single market and on the other hand to address associated risks it was accompanied by the publication of a report on the safety and liability implications of artificial intelligence_the internet of things robotics' the federal government also participated in the associated consultation procedure in the form of a statement: in june , the european parliament established special committee on artificial intelligence in digital age it also published recommendations_on framework_of_ethical aspects_of_artificial intelligence__robotics_and related technologies and recommendations on a civil liability regime for artificial intelligence in october . the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) adopted the first recommendation on internationally agreed ai_principles on  . they include principles for   responsible   stewardship of   trustworthy ai and policy and   cooperation recommendations the g20 countries also adopted identical   principles in june . furthermore; the oecd has opened the al policy observatory and in place an extensive ai programme on work; innovation, productivity and skills, which   germany is   supporting significantly. on  june ,at the initiative of canada and france, the global partnership on ai (gpai) was launched, of which germany is also founding  member: this long-term international multi-stakeholder initiative bringing together leading and independent experts from the fields of science, business and civil society from a broad range of different countries aims to support the responsible use of aland complement the work ofthe oecd the first multi- stakeholder conference is scheduled for the end of .at the level of the council of europe, the new ad hoc committee on artificial intelligence (cahai) began its work in november . during its two-year mandate; it will examine the feasibility and possible elements of a legal framework for the development; design and use of al based on the council of europe's legal standards in the area of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, in the scope of a broad- based stakeholder dialogue the federal government is actively supporting the cahals work study commission on artificial intelligence social responsibility and economic, social and ecological potential the study commission on artificial intelligence social responsibility and economic, social and ecological potential established by the 19th german bundestag studied al's impact on our lives (and how we live together), the german economy and the future world of work and explored the opportunities and challenges alpresents for society, government and economy: based on this, the study commission then identified the need for action by the state the   and may put



federal government followed the work of the al study commission closely and is including relevant input from the study commission's work in the updated ai strategy in all fields of action: ai strategy priorities the rapid pace of technological development and the changing economic, social and political conditions mean that the al strategy initiatives are also being constantly further developed the federal government is liaising closely with the scientific community, business and industry and society as well as the lander; the eu and other national and international actors to this end. the update of the federal government's measures outlined below is divided into the following priorities pursued by the strategy: minds (technical expertise), research; transfer and application; the regulatory framework and society. the issues of pandemic control, environmental and climate protection, and european and international networking in particular take centre stage in the initiatives: with this update, the federal governmentis working to ensure that technology benefits humans and that the further development and use of ai is aligned with the sustainable development goals (sdgs?), which it has committed to in the scope of the united nations (un) sustainable development agenda it is also working to ensure that all stakeholders in the field of al honour their individual   responsibility to respect human rights international networking with developing and emerging countries also plays an important role here, in order to enable these countries to participate in the use of al technologies and to develop ai applications for sustainable economic, ecological and social development furthermore; the federal government will work to encourage that the technology is designed to be both energy and resource-efficient and is used as an instrument for environmental conservation. direct and indirect environmental impacts will also be taken into account in all of so as to include rebound effects and shifting of environmental problems measures to foster and apply alare already being implemented and their financial impacts are baked into the current financial budget: in addition to the funds originally earmarked, an additional  billion euros is available from the federal government's ""package for the future' and an overall concept for the allocation of these funds is in the process of being drafted additional funding needs to implement the strategy will require direct, complete and permanent counter- -financing; on  september , the  member states of the united nations adopted the_sustainable development agenda containing  sustainable development goals (sdgs) www_ ki-strategie-deutschland.de  this, many= any



minds the highly competitive labour market for ai experts presents businesses,  universities and research institutions alike with major challenges in the search for qualified candidates for vacancies in the field of ai. germany is vying for highly qualified al experts in research and development with other countries and numerous global companies in particular8 above all,it is becoming increasingly difficult to establish al research at locations that do not already have an ai focus therefore,itis ofvital importance to the federal government to secure more specialists through university courses and education and training and to create an attractive working and research environment for scientists attractive working conditions in germany as a centre of science and research in concert with the lander and the business community, the federal government wants to sustainably secure internationally outstanding specialist expertise in germany as a centre of science and research and, in this context; reaffirms its goal of providing funding for the establishment of  new professorships in ai at german universities. one example is the new alexander von humboldt professorship in al for internationally renowned researchers further al professorships are planned at the centres of excellence for al research: here, the tight-knit research network between the centres   will ensure particularly   attractive conditions for researchers from germany and abroad  together with the lander; the federal government is also supporting the creation of al professorships in the scope of the tenure track programme and the excellence strategy. establishing al professorships at universities of applied sciences is and move designed to involve smes in particular and promote greater implementation of al at smes. in addition to this, a dedicated daad (german academic exchange service) programme for master students and doctoral candidates is to be set up to attract young international researchers to selected programmes and, through incentives for top-level ai  research, will have powerful and enduring  appeal  in germany.   furthermore, ai challenges are to be held that   promote application-oriented ai    innovation and lead to high international visibility through the dynamism this unleashes  in this context; german ""ai made in germany"" award with international reach is to be established it will be ensured that the federal government's measures can dovetail powerful action by the lander: in light of the tight labour market situation and to open up career for future generations of excellent scientists as well, the funding of new al professorships is designed to cover a period of multiple years above and beyond this, the federal government will stress the importance of attractive conditions in germany as a centre of science and research in its talks with the lander and will advocate improved structures for al professorships the federal government will also focus especially on encouraging young researchers, starting by targeting doctoral students and outstanding master students to highlight the attractive prospects available in the research system, as are the professors of tomorrow. researchers at the nexus between al and other disciplines will be supported in particular: in coordination with its funding bodies, the german research foundation (dfg) is supporting interdisciplinary the  global talent report shows a net drain of al experts with doctorates www_ki-strategie-deutschland.de  paths salary they



al research groups and young researcher groups in the scope of the renowned emmy noether programme, thus opening up career for young researchers bolstering al expertise making germany a globally leading location for al research; development and application requires a broad and highly trained specialist workforce_ the federal government will therefore be working with the lander to strengthen the academic qualifications of students with al expertise and to improve the quality and performance of higher education through the responsible use of al the federal government will continue to foster innovation in higher education through ai and big data, such as the al-supported development of university courses or design of learning settings the idea behind this is not just to promote research in this field but to set in motion the transfer to the operation at the universities, too thus, projects within specific priority subjects will be devoted, for instance, to the al-supported and automatic setting of exam tasks or learning paths, al-supported feedback on learning processes or al-supported assistants for analysing, planning or organising studies to sustainably secure ai skills and expertise in germany,it is also important to encourage young people to develop passion for stem  subjects, so science,  technology, engineering and mathematics, and the career prospects building on these the federal government is pursuing this goal with the stem action plan, inter alia through nationally funded stem clusters and the communication   campaign  #mintmagie (stem magic) the federal government wants to encourage women in particular to discover stem careers, and in turn increase the share of female students studying stem subjects the federal government is also working to counter the current shortage of specialists by doubling down on eliminating discrimination against qualified women: when it comes to securing enough skilled labour to meet demand in the field of ai, the federal government believes in a sectoral approach in order to find tailored solutions education and training curricula are being adapted. in addition to school and vocational and higher education; the focus is also on skills   development and  continuing  training at   companies   for the development and use of al al expertise is also being developed in public administration with its ""national skills strategy"" the federal government is already implementing a broadly targeted set of instruments to promote the skills of the workforce in times of demographic; digital and ecological change. in the future, the spotlight will increasingly be on both al-specific skills and ai-supported applications the federal government will provide more targeted support for health-related al research and development with a view to retaining scientific al expertise in the german healthcare system, too. here,it will also support the integration of almodules in education and training in the fields of healthcare and long-term care: in the mobility sector; the federal government is planning a package of measures entitled ""al for innovative mobility solutions' which inter alia is designed to contribute to securing the next generation of experts and ai skills development in the area of mobility research: furthermore, the federal government will be partnering with the plattform _lernende systeme to develop initiatives to prepare and showcase helpful use cases in detail to serve as best practice examples, creating incentives for other businesses, too. www_ ki-strategie-deutschland.de  paths regular



beyond this, the federal government is fostering the establishment and development of technical al expertise in the global south to effectively meet the high demand that exists globally. here, it is effectively supporting countries in dealing with changes in local labour markets. research the federal government has been promoting and funding al research in germany for over  now. as a result; germany is well positioned internationally: german al researchers are cooperating with the most prestigious research institutes worldwide and publishing their work in the most prestigious journals9 this foundation needs to be cemented and expanded further to secure and strengthen the technological sovereignty of germany and europe strengthening national research structures to further strengthen germanys position as a centre of research, the federal government will continue to actively push forward the expansion of the six existing centres of excellence for ai research and linking these at regional, national and international level the aim is to establish a research and teaching network at german universities that pools different types of al expertise locally, fosters innovation with local businesses in the regions and in association with application hubs, and is reputed at international level as a prestigious network; too the plan is to dovetail the existing centres at the universities in berlin, dresden/leipzig, dortmund/st augustin, munich and tubingen and the german research centre for artificial intelligence with other application hubs to be established to form network of at least twelve centres and hubs. in this context; there are also plans to establish additional innovation centres for smart mobility. subject to an excellent scientific evaluation; the federal government and the lander will fund the five university centres of excellence permanently. the use of al is predominantly attributable to the increased availability oflarge computing capacities which enable the use of alapplications in practice. al research in germany also needs to have access to modern and high-performing computing infrastructures the federal governmentis making an important contribution to this by expanding the centres of excellence for al research and by promoting high performance computing (hpc): to build suitable computing capacities throughout germany, the federal government will work with the different lander to accelerate the expansion of the gauss centre for supercomputing to exascale capability in addition to developing the national supercomputing centre (nhr) especially taking into account future peak demand for ai applications and for analysing large data volumes particular attention will be_ to energy and resource efficiency as well as possibilities for industrial use: a connection to gaia-x and the mobility data space is planned here to create a new and trustworthy to use by business and industry, for instance industry .. the ever-faster acceleration of technological developments is also impacting research and the translation of its findings into practice the   federal   government is responding to these the  ai_index  ranks   germany fifth   worldwide in terms of the number of  scientific publications on al: www_ ki-strategie-deutschlandde  years rising paid bridge

from the scientific community, businesses, trade unions and civil society is involved in the of the al observatory: as part of the al observatory, the federal government is developing indicators for al monitoring in the field of work and society to review the implementation of the ai strategy. the ai observatory also studies the interaction between humans and al at the workplace  for safe and human-centric use of ai-based applications, for which the ai observatory will submit proposals. in order to support businesses in introducing human-centric ai, the model of hubs for the future (zukunftszentren) initially set up in eastern germany is now rolled out throughout germany. these are designed inter alia to enable businesses and their employees to structure and shape the digital  transformation, especially when it comes to ai the aim is to make the knowledge about how ai-based systems work available in a way that is tailored to the business' use case to be able to design introduction and application processes in the framework of social partnerships between labour and management or in participatory way and to impart the requisite skills. funding for   company-based learning and experimentation spaces will be   expanded. experimentation spaces enable businesses or public administrations and their employees to work together to develop and test solutions for human-centric   introduction and implementation of al processes in operational practice in a creative process; the process will be accompanied by research ai in public administration al offers huge potential not just for businesses but also for public administration: using al here is an opportunity not only to provide information and services in a more targeted, tailored and more easily accessible way within the administration and for the business and scientific communities, but also to support the of a climate-neutral federal administration by . the federal government will be exploring to what extent al can be used to improve general (information) security and the performance of communication and information systems, to potential cyber attacks and as possible basis for future security architectures in public administration ai could, for instance, be  applied through the use of (semi) automated procedures or al-based services to detect attacks on public administration communication networks_ in some areas of the administration's remits involving ever-higher data volumes, for instance earth observation/remote sensing, further developing automated data analysis procedures with ai methods is necessary prerequisite for   harnessing the   potential for the federal administration's work, inter alia in disaster control, to be exploited at all. the al methods developed above all by researchers in recent years need to be transposed onto the specific tasks of the federal authorities and adapted if necessary: it is hugely important to continue to apply high standards for the introduction and use of al and to ensure that al is non-discriminatory and transparent; complies with existing rules governing the protection of personal data, information security requirements and upholds citizens' trust and confidence  traceability (nachvollziehbarkeit"") and verifiability of decisions as well as transparency, fairness and non-discrimination; safety and security and participation are key to creating trust in the use of al in public administration individual opt-out possibilities also have the potential to contribute to this depending on the use case: www_ki-strategie-deutschland.de  work being goal stop



the al observatory is working on questions relating to the human-centric design, introduction anduse of al that serves society as a whole in suitable processes labour and social administration and offering support to interested authorities in public procurement processes, the federal government will increasingly opt for innovative al solutions, harnessing public-sector demand and public tenders as steering tool. it will continue to develop the centre of excellence for innovative procurement (koinno) in order to permanently bolster the orientation towards innovation in public procurement in a way that is subject and technology neutral. it will also promote the exchange of best practices in public administration: to support public authorities, the federal government will define standard processes for decision-making, purchasing, implementation and operation of al applications in public administration open-source solutions will also be increasingly considered in procurement: the federal government itself can support start-ups and smes with ai solutions by giving greater consideration to these in public contracts in compliance with the requirements under budgetary and public procurement law: in combination with al applications, the systematic provision, compilation, modelling and evaluation of environment-related mass data can identify changes and patterns and leverage efficiency potentials for instance in the area of climate impact assessment; ecosystem analysis or the analysis of mobility and energy consumption behaviour: to this end, the federal government will set up an application lab for ai and data' with the aim of developing data-based   applications to attain the sustainable development goals and strengthen the cooperation between the federal  government and the lander on ai  applications in the environmental sector: al offers potential for security authorities to counter hybrid threats to preserve territorial integrity and protect the population: in the context of policing, the use of al is an important strategic aspect of domestic security. for instance, it can help to significantly enhance existing capabilities and make   police work more targeted and effective: it can also   relieve the psychological strain on police officers, for instance if al is used to identify child pornography: in each specific use case, though; it must be examined whether and how al can be deployed in a policing context in compliance with fundamental rights the federal armed forces (bundeswehr) are examining the possibility of using al first to fulfil the core mission of its  armed forces and to informational,  decision-making and effectiveness superiority, and second to optimise administrative and logistical processes and in the predictive maintenance of complex systems al is also used to support specialist personnel in the context of civil-military early crisis detection across differentremits in the analysis ofmass data and to make projections for deployments al is an integral part of major defence projects, which are also being implemented in european context; contributing to maintaining and fostering european technological excellence one example is the next generation weapon system (ngws) project launched jointly with france and spain, which is interconnected with airborne platforms of the future combat air   system (fcas) in terms of national and international technological developments in the armaments sector, al serves to ensure the capabilities required for national and allied defence in the future developing the possibilities to deploy al; in particular for the protection of national security and for military purposes, is carried out within the remits and responsibilities of the respective ministries and departments without prejudice to this; ai technologies  and ai  applications of security relevance are embedded in the ai strategy:   big gain



regulatory framework in addition to fostering competitiveness and innovation in the european union, one of the federal government's stated aims is the responsible development and use of ai for the benefit of society as whole whilst the multifaceted and ever-growing range of possible uses of al harbours major economic, social and individual potential benefits, it can also entail risks. to counteract these effectively, specific requirements need to be set for the development and use of ai systems and the framework for responsible development and use of these systems for the benefit of the common good needs to be aligned accordingly. underlying conditions for safe and trustworthy al applications the regulatory framework includes laws, subordinate acts and technical standards and the detailed framework must include in particular a level of transparency and traceability that adequately reflects the risks and, if necessary, an appropriate control structure and verifiability of al applications and their results. standardisation and norms can contribute to accelerating development processes, legal  certainty for companies and to building people's trust and confidence in this technology: in areas where the use of al entails huge innovation potential, regulation must be careful to encourage rather than hamper innovation: the federal government welcomes the approach proposed by the european commission in the white paper on artificial  intelligence of reviewing the eu's existing legal  framework to determine whether existing legislation duly reflects the risks and requirements of al applications and can be effectively enforced or whether and what amendments or new legislation may be necessary. here; the question to be answered is whether the current legal framework on product safety and product liability is sufficient for al systems embedded in products o whether new provisions need to be created, also when it comes to the issue of legal certainty. in particular; the federal government believes it makes sense in the interest of principle-based regulation to draft central principles for trustworthy al which areharmonised across the eu. in addition to this, the federal government is actively supporting the processes and initiatives that have already been launched at the level of the eu and the council of europe in this regard. as the covid  pandemic has highlighted, the regulatory framework needs to be sufficiently flexible to allow innovation to be accelerated when it is a matter of averting major harm to the community. the ""report_on the safety and liability implications of artificial intelligence_the internet of things and robotics"" published with the european commission's white paper on ai clarifies the requirements to be met for safe al this poses new challenges to the regulatory framework; which in the single market for products is currently shaped by the legislative framework (nlf) and here in particular to the quality infrastructure consisting of metrology, norms and standardisation; accreditation; conformity assessment and market surveillance the task is to further develop the existing structures into systems for safe and trustworthy ai. need for regulation in work settings and for product safety to meet these requirements, it is necessary first of all to review the existing technical, regulatory and structural conditions and to adapt or create new ones where these are necessary or currently insufficient this includes rolling out and further developing quality infrastructure and empowering and enabling those acting within it; as well as incentives for innovations for safe   new



and trustworthy al applications this entails developing the relevant institutional competencies and capacities, particularly in the fields of occupational health and safety and product safety: the use of al presents new challenges in regulatory areas such as employee data protection and co-determination, but also for the social partners the use of alat businesses and companies can mean larger amounts of personal data being processed. here, the opportunities of using al must be weighed up against the risks of additional data processing: on employee data protection; the coalition agreement of the governing coalition states that the optionality clause in the eu general data protection regulation should be used and the possible creation of a separate act on employee data protection examined: the use of al-based products and services also gives rise to changed, and in some cases new requirements for evidencing functional safety. established safety requirements from the areas of machine safety and occupational health and safety regarding mental and physical hazards must not be weakened taking into account human-machine interaction: the regulatory framework varies a great deal from area to area, making it necessary to incorporate standards as well as any potential regulations early on in the development of al applications so as to accelerate the subsequent approval process and in turn market access. security, robustness and sustainability of ai a great deal of attention needs to be to the aspect of information security. the federal government will work towards it security standards for al systems (for instance in the area of critical infrastructures), which will vary in accordance with the respective use purpose. ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of certain al systems over their entire life is key here: when developing al systems, the detection of attacks therefore also needs to be included in any risk assessments when using al; effective protection against discrimination, manipulation or any other misuse needs to be ensured. the more social  diversity is reflected in the teams   developing ai applications including above and beyond gender aspects the more likely it is that bias and discrimination can be prevented from the very outset: the federal government will champion these principles at national, european and international level the major potential harboured by ai made in europe"" should be fully leveraged for the green deal: to enable the environmental administration to use al in a legally compliant way quickly and to effectively support the of ""sustainable ai"" as an important component of sustainable digitalisation, environmental law is being examined to see whether modifications might make sense. society ai has long since arrived in people's everyday lives trust in al is growingl, but parts of the population   still need more information and have   reservations or concerns: the federal government provide help to promote the human-centric introduction and application of  statista (): germans' confidence in al is growing: the proportion of germans who say i can imagine communicating with artificial intelligence"" rose from %in  to % in . www_ ki-strategie-deutschlandde  paid cycle goal will



this technology: this entails strengthening the societal dialogue and opportunities for citizens to have a say, and using new forms of effective participation, for instance for users or civil society: the concerns and interests of people with disabilities must also be duly taken into account this should create an overarching common understanding among all stakeholders and enable viable solutions the opportunity to have a say and help shape developments has a major role to play in the development; introduction and use of ai: the earlier the groups or institutions directly or indirectly impacted are involved, the better can feed their knowledge, experience and needs into the process, helping to ensure that the positive potential of al is fully harnessed with this in mind, the federal government is pooling its infrastructures and funding programmes in the field of al use that serves the common good and is driving forward the development of an ecosystem for ai for the of society. this includes the civic innovation platform project to connect civil society players from all sections of society: the platform enables them to publish their ideas and find potential project partners from civil society, educational institutions, science and research; public administration; smes, al developers and start-ups additionally, the federal government is developing a civic data lab to prepare data sets shared and provided by various civil society actors and access and exchange structures, and civic tech labs for green for the participatory development and provision of green tech tools al in the cultural and media sector is far more than just a subject ofartistic debate in many cases; al is also used in the production of art ad media content: humans and al can collaborate creatively: furthermore, al makes a valuable contribution at many cultural institutions in the processing of large amounts of data, in collection activities (for instance of museums, libraries and archives), in curating or in conveying cultural knowledge so the federal government will continue to advance the development of alapplications in different cultural and media contexts ai skills for all every citizen in  germany should be well informed about the importance of ai and the opportunities and challenges it presents to do away with prejudices and demystify al this also means that; when discussing risks, areas should be more clearly delineated where certain risks cannot occur if, for instance industrial al where no personal data is being used. first; there is a need to strengthen digital skills for dealing with al related to everyday life, and second, the potential of al applications should be used to empower citizens, for instance to design and shape teaching and learning processes the federal government is patron of the free online course 'elements_of al"", aimed at the full breadth of the population whose objective is to make the mechanisms of al and its possible uses more comprehensible to as many people as possible including those without prior knowledge to limit the energy and resources al systems need, a sustainable albrand is being developed in participatory process and requirements and incentives developed the prerequisites for this are expanding the database on energy and resource needs, improving the transparency of energy and resource needs and ecological requirements for the use of al including the al infrastructure the sustainable al brand makes it possible to pool german solutions around the principles of ""sustainability by design"" and 'ethics by design and share them internationally for instance for resource-efficient alas well as economically more sustainable and socially more balanced ai   they good

introduction our modern society faces many challenges that endanger the survival of humankind such as global environmental problems, growing economic disparity, and the depletion of resources. japan is the first country to tackle social issues confronting a mature society, such as the declining birthrate and aging population, labor shortage, rural depopulation, and increased fiscal spending: artificial intelligence (al) is considered a technology to rescue society from these problems, to address the set  forth in the united nation's   sustainable development goals (sdgs), and to build a sustainable world. with the establishment of society5.' whose purpose is to address social issues and economic  development ai, aims to revitalize its  society and economy, to be an internationally attractive society, and to contribute to the sdgs on a global scale. similar to many other types of science and technology, al will many benefits to society, but its   large impact on society calls for appropriate   development and implementation. in order to avoid or reduce the negative aspects in advance while making effective use of alto benefit society, we should promote, together with the continued research and development (randd) of technologies related to ai, a transformation into an ai-ready society"" where ai can be used effectively and safely: we need to redesign society in every way including japan's human   potential, social  systems, industrial structures, innovation systems, and governance. depending on the researcher; there are various ways of thinking about the definition of ai (artificial intelligence), a central theme of this document; and there is no clear definition at present: for example, the ec high-level expert group defines ai as a system that performs intelligent operations (which may have some autonomy) in response to environment and input. however, the expression ""intelligent operation"" itself is somewhat vague and open for interpretation: also, the ailoo report' published in the united states in  cites nils j. nilsson's definition4 of al as a field of research according to which artificial intelligence is that activity devoted to making machines intelligent,  and intelligence is that quality that enables an entity to function appropriately and with foresight in its environment"" but this definition is also highly ambiguous. in actuality, the vague definition of al within the same report in and of itself has a positive side that is accelerating the study of ai. in light of these circumstances, although there is a certain consensus 0n what to judge as ai or ai technology, it does not appear appropriate at this time to define it more strictly. in addition, various technologies normally called ""al"" are seldom used alone but instead are generally incorporated and used as of an information system. advanced and complex society . is the future society that japan aims following the information society (society .). a society that realizes society . is a sustainable human-centric society that implements ai, iot (internet of things), robotics and other cutting-edge technologies to create unprecedented value, and a wide range of people can realize their own well-being while respecting the well-being of others high-level expert group on artificial intelligence (ai hleg) ""draft ethics guidelines for trustworthy ai"" and 'a definition of a: main capabilities and scientific disciplines' european commission, directorate-general for communication, december . stone, p. et al. artificial intelligence and life . one hundred year study on artificial intelligence: report of the - study panel"" , stanford university, stanford, ca, sept: . nils j. nilsson, the quest for artificial intelligence: history of ideas and achievements, cambridge, uk: cambridge university press, . many key goals japan; using bring great report? part for,



information systems may incorporate a broad range of ai technologies; moreover; they may incorporate technologies reflected in the principles stated in this document: based on these two premises, the principles herein may be regarded as applying to any ""highly complex information systems in general' that include any such technology: given such consideration, we do not define a particular technology o system as ""al"" , but regard al as ""highly complex information systems in general' after discussing some of the impacts  society, we will present a set of a social principles and identify some issues to consider in ai randd and social implementation: in order to make the ensuing society . as effective as possible, it is essential for all relevant stakeholders to cooperate and interact closely with each other:

 basic philosophy ai is expected to contribute significantly to the realization of society .. we consider ai important not oly to return the benefits obtained from the efficiency and convenience of using ai to people and society, but also to use al for the public ofhumanity as a whole, and to ensure global sustainability outlined in the sdgs through qualitative changes in social conditions and true innovation. we believe we should respect the following three values as our philosophy and build a society that pursues their realization. () dignity: a society that has respect for human dignity we should not build a society where humans are overly dependent on ai or where ai is used to control human behavior  through the excessive pursuit of efficiency and convenience. we need to construct a society where human dignity is respected and, by using ai as a tool, a society where people can better demonstrate their various human abilities, show greater creativity, engage in challenging work, and live richer lives both physically and mentally.  diversity and inclusion: a society where people with diverse backgrounds can pursue their own well-being it is both an ideal in the modern world and major challenge to create a society in which people with diverse backgrounds, values and ways of thinking can pursue their own well-being while society creates new value by flexibly embracing them. alis a technology powerful enough to us closer to this ideal. we need to change the nature of society in this way through the appropriate development and deployment of ai  sustainability: a sustainable society we need to use al to create a succession of new businesses and solutions, resolve social disparities, and develop a sustainable society that can deal with issues such as global environmental problems and climate change. japan, as a leading science and technology- oriented   country, has an obligation to strengthen its accumulated scientific and technological resources by utilizing al and thereby contributing to the creation of such a sustainable society. good bring



 social changes needed to realize_society .  al-ready society"" technologies  expected to contribute to the realization of society . include ai; iot, robotics, and ultra-high-speed broadband communication networks. even if it becomes possible to some extent to entrust complex processes to machines using ai, it is still necessary for humans to set objectives that answer the question ""what are we ai for?"" while ai can be used to better society, it might also be used for undesirable purposes or in inappropriate ways unconsciously. for this reason; we are advancing technological developments in terms of   human potential, social systems, industrial structures, innovation systems; and governance which can answer the question ""what are we using ai for?"" while paying close attention to their interaction with the progress of technology these five aspects are equally important in achieving society .. human potential in an ""ai-ready society"" that is responsive to the spread of al to every corner of society, how human respond to ai is the to realizing society where al can be utilized. to that end, the expected abilities and roles of people are as follows a) people should fully understand the advantages and disadvantages of ai. in particular; people should have the ability to recognize that biases are included in the algorithms andlor data that will become the information resources of ai, and for example, that these biases may be used for undesirable purposes. in addition, people should recognize that there are three types of data bias: statistical bias, bias caused by social conditions, and bias arising from malicious intent among ai users. b) it is preferred that the use of al will create an environment in which many people can engage in highly creative and productive work. to that end, it is expected that a diverse range of people will acquire the ability to realize their own dreams and ideas with als support despite many differences in origin, culture, taste, and so on. an education system that achieves these as well as social systems that contribute to their achievement must be realized. it is important to have sufficient human resources  with acquired application skills such as implementation and design of ai systems and basic knowledge of data and ai: these skills would be acquired in cross-disciplinary range of fields in combined and  integrated framework it is expected that such human resources will be the driving force of all activities in society, and that the capabilities of those people will contribute to the formation of an al-based environment. given the establishment of such a environment we must implement social systems that allow many people to live a richer and more fulfilling life. ) social systems the use of ai will most likely accelerate the evolution of individual service solutions and create various benefits from improved efficiency and individualization. in order to embrace the full benefits of this change in society, it is necessary for entire social systems including health care, finance, insurance, transportation, energy, and others to flexibly change and respond to the evolution of ai this includes simple efficiency in light of existing socially accepted objectives (such as improved convenience and liberation from simple labor tasks) it also includes the realization of new value potentially created by diversification and fluidization of objectives and resolving negative outcomes such as inequality, widening disparity, social exclusion, and so on) that may result from the evolution of ai. to this end; we need to implement flexible architecture designs equipped with mechanisms for expandability, interoperability, developing improved social order; and s0 on, both in the software and the hardware aspects of each social additionally, we need to establish common data  using beings key - fully goals living living system:



utilization   infrastructure for various  social systems, in particular to ensure interoperability and connectivity: ) industrial structures in order for a diverse group of people to realize their assorted dreams and ideas, it is necessary for labor as well as employment and entrepreneur environments to be flexible and internationally open: for this reason, companies   should compete  fairly and promote  flexible  working styles, human creativity   should  continually be demonstrated   throughout  industries,  and investment in startup businesses should be promoted: innovation systems (environments that support innovation) it is necessary for universities, research institutions, industries, and the public at large to  participate in ais randd, utilization and evaluation across fields and  positions, stimulating each other; and creating an environment in which innovation can flourish: to that end, all types of data including real space data should be instantaneously and securely available at a level that al can analyze. additionally, it is advisable to ensure privacy and security so that everyone can provide and distribute data with ease, and for there to be an environment where they can benefit from the data that they have provided it is   advisable to accelerate the   desired   development of ai by establishing an environment in which those involved in randd; including users, can safely conduct randd and utilization of ai, and the of randd and utilization can move rapidly. preferably, the utilization of al will create new ideas and possibilities, and significantly expand the potential of innovation. governance it is always necessary to continue to update the content and defined purposes discussed in the above-mentioned sections human potential, social systems, industrial structures, and innovation systems in line with social changes and technological developments. for that reason, it is necessary to have a system that can be implemented and in place for various stakeholders, including government; industry, universities, research institutions, and the general public. then will be able to work together on such matters as identifying issues, evaluating impacts, and making decisions  regulatory governance including rules, systems, standardization and codes of conduct: additionally, it is necessary to listen to people, including those who have a difficult time having their opinions heard, in addition the various stakeholders, and to establish system that continuously addresses the most advanced social and technical issues. when implementing such governance, flexible and effective measures should be taken not only in terms of the law but also by means of industries with appropriate technical means taking the initiative. in addition, international coordination for governance is important, and in addition to governance in each individual country, an international system of cooperation for dealing with cross-border problems should be established. cycle they



social principles_of human-centric ai we recognize that in order to realize an ai-ready society"" and to promote an appropriate and proactive social implementation of ai, it is important to establish basic principles that each stakeholder should keep in mind. in order for ai to be accepted and properly used by society, we will systemize these basic principles into ""social principles of al"" to which society (especially state legislative and administrative bodies) should pay attention, and ""randd and utilization principles of al"" to which developers and operators engaged in ai randd and social implementation should pay attention: the ""social principles of al"" necessary for realizing a society with the three basic principles listed in section , and the ""randd and utilization principles of ai"" that developers and business operators should consider, are as follows:  social principles of ai social   principles   of ai are principles   relating to social  frameworks that  should be implemented across japanese society including national and local governments as well as in multilateral frameworks in an ai-ready society.' () the human-centric principle the utilization of al must not infringe upon the fundamental human rights guaranteed by the constitution and international standards. ai should be developed, utilized, and implemented in society to expand the abilities of people and allow diverse people to pursue their own well-being: in a society making use of ai, it is desirable that we introduce appropriate mechanisms for literacy education and for the promotion of proper use of ai s0 that people do not become over-dependent on ai or misuse ai to manipulate other people's decision-making: ai can expand human abilities and creativity not only by replacing aspects ofhuman labor but also by assisting humans as a technologically advanced tool. when using ai, people must judge and decide for themselves how to use it. the appropriate stakeholders involved in the development, delivery and utilization of ai should be responsible for the consequences of ai utilization, depending on the nature of the problem: in the process of ai deployment, each stakeholder should take into consideration the user-friendliness of the system in order to allow all people to enjoy the benefits of ai and avoid creating a digital divide with so-called ""information or ""technology poor"" people left behind: the principle of education/literacy in a society premised on ai, we do not desire to create disparities or divisions between people o create those who are socially disadvantaged. therefore, policy makers and managers of businesses involved in ai must have an accurate understanding of ai, knowledge and ethics permitting appropriate use of al in society: they should take into account the complexity of al and appreciate the possibility that ai could be intentional poor""



misused. ai users should have a general understanding of ai and should acquire sufficient education to use it   properly,  given that ai platforms are much more complicated than already developed conventional tools. regarding developers of ai, meanwhile, it is of course necessary for them to master the basics of al technology: additionally, from the viewpoint of developing ai that is useful to society, it is important for developers to learn business models for how al can be used in society, as well as to master a wide range of liberal arts such as social sciences and ethics including normative consciousness. from this point of view, we believe that an educational environment that fosters education and literacy in accordance with the following principles must be provided equally to all people. in  order to prevent generating disparities between people or to create socially vulnerable individuals, opportunities for education in a wide range of literacy skills are to be   provided in  early  childhood education and  primary and  secondary education. opportunities are also to be provided for the reeducation of working adults and the elderly: with regard to literacy education and skills required to use ai, ur society needs an educational system that allows anyone to acquire the basics of mathematics, and data   science. all people need to learn beyond the boundaries of literature and science. it is also necessary to prepare content in literacy education on the limits of security and ai technology in order to raise awareness of ai and data characteristics. these characteristics include bias in data, the possibility of causing bias depending on how ai is used, and issues of fairness, impartiality, and privacy protection that are inherently needed in the use of ai: in a society where ai is pervasive, it is to be  expected that the educational environment will change from the current unilateral and uniform teaching style to one that makes use of individual interests and skill sets. for that reason, society as whole shares a sense that the education system is always changing flexibly to the optimal   form of teaching regardless of previous successful experiences in the educational environment to date. in education; it is desirable to have an interactive educational environment for the prevention of dropouts and an environment that fully utilizes ai technologies to allow students to work together: it is desirable not to impose an unnecessary burden only on the administration or schools (teachers), but to work independently with private enterprises and citizens toward the development of such an educational environment: the principle of privacy protection not all ai technologies increase the risk associated with the use of personal data, but in a society premised on a, it is still possible to gauge each person's political position, economic situation, personal hobbies, personal preferences, and so forth with great accuracy based on data about matters such as data subject's individual behavior. this means, when utilizing ai, that more careful discretion may be required than the mere handling of personal data in accordance with the level of importance and sensitivity of the data. each stakeholder must handle personal data based on the following principles to ensure that no individuals are disadvantaged from the unexpected distribution or use  ai,



of personal data in undesirable ways. we should make sure that any ai using personal data and any service solutions that use al, including use by the government, do not infringe on a person's individual freedom, dignity or equality. ifthe use of ai threatens to increase the possibility ofharming individuals, technical mechanisms and non-technical frameworks should be developed to reduce the risk: in particular; al using personal data should have mechanisms to ensure accuracy and legitimacy, and to allow individuals to be substantially involved in managing the privacy of their personal data. this would make it possible for people to provide personal data with peace of mind when ai, and effectively benefit from the data they provide. personal data must be protected appropriately according to its degree of importance and sensitivity: personal data   contains a variety f information, ranging from matters that are highly likely to have a influence on an individual's rights and interests  (these  would typically be personal  thoughts, beliefs, medical history, criminal records, and s0 on), to matters that are semi-public in nature in a person's social life. keeping this in mind, we need to pay close attention to the balance between the use of, and need for protection 0f, personal data based on the cultural background and common understanding of society. the principle of ensuring security the active use of al automates social systems and greatly improves safety. on the other hand, at least within the scope of currently available technologies, it is not always possible for ai to respond appropriately to rare events or deliberate attacks_ therefore, the use of ai poses a new set of risks to security. society should always be aware of the balance between the benefits and risks, and endeavor to improve social safety and sustainability as whole. society must promote broad, deep research and development related to ai (from immediate measures to deep essential understanding) , such as the proper assessment of risks in the utilization of a[ and research to reduce risks. society must make firm efforts to conduct risk management including the safeguard of cybersecurity. society should always pay attention to sustainability in the use of ai society, in particular; must not be uniquely dependent on just one type of al or a few specific types of ai. the principle of fair competition fair competitive environment must be maintained in order to create new businesses and services, to maintain sustainable economic growth, and to present solutions to social challenges. even if resources related to al are concentrated in a specific country, we must not have a society where unfair data collection and infringement of sovereignty are performed under that country's dominant position: even if resources related to al are concentrated into specific companies, we must using great many



not have a society where unfair data collection and unfair competition take place their dominant position: the use of ai should not generate a situation where wealth and social influence are unfairly biased towards certain stakeholders: the principle of fairness, accountability, and transparency in an ""ai-ready society"" it is necessary to ensure fairness  and transparency in decision-making, appropriate accountability for the results, and trust in the technology; so that people who use ai are not subject to undue discrimination with regard to personal background, or to unfair treatment in terms of human dignity. under ais   design   concept; all   people are treated fairly   without   unjustified discrimination on the   grounds  of diverse  backgrounds such as race, gender; nationality, age, political beliefs, religion, and so on. appropriate explanations should be given on a case-by-case basis depending on the application of al and each particular situation, including such things as when al is used, how the ai data is obtained and used, and what measures have been taken to ensure the appropriateness of results obtained from al operations. in order for people to understand ais proposals and make judgments on them, there should be appropriate opportunities for an open dialogue, as required, regarding the use, adoption, and operation of ai taking into account the above viewpoints and in order to use al safely in society, mechanism must be   established to ensure trust   in ai, and in the data and algorithms that support it the principle of innovation to realize society . and aim for continuous innovation that advances as people evolve together with ai development; we   should transcend boundaries   such as national borders, industries, academia, governments, race, gender; nationality, age, political convictions and religion: we should promote total globalization, diversification; and industry-academia-government   cooperation in both human resources and research, based on a wide range ofknowledge, perspectives, ideas, and so on we must promote equal collaboration among universities, research institutions and companies, and the flexible movement of human resources. to implement ai efficiently and safely in society, methods for confirming the quality and reliability of ai, and for efficient collection and maintenance of data used by ai must be promoted. in addition to establishing al engineering such as methods for the development; and operation of ai,it is necessary to promote the establishment and development of a wide range of studies such as ethical and economic aspects of ai. to ensure the sound development of al technology, while securing privacy and  using being testing



security, it is necessary to establish a platform environment where data from all fields can be effectively utilized across national borders without monopolized. in addition, to promote research on ai, randd environments should be established where computer resources and high-speed networks that promote international collaboration and accelerate al are shared and used. the government must proceed with regulatory reforms to reduce impeding factors in all related fields in order to establish an efficient and beneficial society with the aid of ai technologies  airandd and utilization principles we believe that developers and business operators of al should establish and comply with the ai development and utilization principles based on the fundamental philosophy and social principles of al outlined above. since many countries, organizations, companies, and so on are currently discussing ai development and utilization principles, we believe it is important to create an international consensus  quickly through open  discussions, and share results   internationally in a non- regulatory, non-binding framework:  conclusion in order to lead the world in building the first al-ready society,"" japan should share the principles herein with the government, related industries, organizations, and so 0n, and reflect them in government policies. in addition, japan should share these principles with other countries around the world and take a leadership role in international discussions with the of establishing an al-ready society worldwide. in doing so, japan should present to the world a social image of society . that supports the realization of the sdgs, and should contribute to cooperative and creative new development of the international community. these principles should be flexibly revised in the future according to the progress of ai- related technologies, social changes, changes in the world situation, and many other factors  being goal

executive summary todav; artificial intelligence (ai) digital models, algorithms and technologies for sophisticated perception, reaso- ning; interaction and learning has matured to the point thatit represents a central factor in the digital transforma- tion of society: going forward, al is predicted to be integrated in and affect the majorityv of economic activities, bv providing opportunities for higher productivity, automation and more advanced analytics across sectors. in this context; the italian al ecosystem has vast potential, vet not fully exploited: the ecosystem is characterized by vibrant research communities but these often lack scale, struggle to attract foreign talent and could also benefit from improvements in the gender representation and patenting performance: with regard to al solution providers, the italian industry is growing rapidly but its economic contribution still remains below its potential, especially com - pared to peer countries in europe the current italian context and international position thus call for a radical upgrade and of italv's national ai strategv: the country needs to build on the positive elements of its ecosvstem while focussing reforms and investments on the specific areas of weakness: to this end, for the three-vear period -, this strategic programme indicates:  objectives: the of the italian strategv;  priority sectors: where italy intends to focus investments,  areas of intervention: how the country aims to achieve the stated objectives: the three areas of intervention are: strengthening and attracting the talents and competences that will enable the al-driven economy, expanding funding of advanced research in al; favouring the adoption of al and its applications both in the administration (pa) and in the italian economv at large for these areas, the strategic programme indicates  policy initiatives italy should embrace (see table on the next page). these will be fundamental for italy to retain technological competitiveness at the international level, connect the excellent results of research with the needs of industry and address the kev challenges of italian society going forward:  update goals public

. the italian ecosystem the italian al ecosvstem is composed of four categories of actors: ) research communities ) knowledge-transfer centres ) technologv and solution providers, and ) private and public user organisations. this section reviews each categorv's relative strengths and weaknesses. a. research communities italy has a vibrant al research community, which contributes to the italian al ecosystem in four wavs: research: italian researchers are active in both fundamental and applied research, thus covering all fields of al: in particular; italian research is clustered around the following topics: machine/deep learning; computer vision, natural language processing (nlp); data mining; big data analvtics, embedded al, human aspects in ai, knowledge representation and svmbolic learning, decision support svstems, agent-based systems and trustworthy al. research in al is mainly carried out in research labs of universities and public research centres as in the national research council (cnr) and in research foundations such as fondazione bruno kessler and the italian institute of technologv: as we shall see later; this community has a widely recognized international standing in terms of qualitv and quantity of its research output: education and training: italian universities offer more than  al curricula spread over roughly  universi- ties. to further boost this ecosvstem, italy launched in  the national ""artificial  intelligence"" phd programme (phd-al.it), one of the largest and most ambitious phd programmes in artificial intelligence worldwide: the programme involves over  universities, three research bodies and three research orga- nisations with a view to train researchers, innovators and professionals. the phd-alit is composed of five federated phd courses, which share a common core curriculum in al foundations and developments. each course has an area of specialisation related to a strategic sector for al application: health and life sciences, agrifood and environment; security and cybersec, industry ., and society: to date; the programme has issued  phd scholarships with a budget of € million: assets: the italian ecosystem hosts several top-tier research infrastructures, in terms of computational power and data lakes  examplesare the cineca-infn infrastructure for hpc, cnr -high performance artificial intelli- gence center hp-al, the iit hpc infrastructures devoted to the new - strategic asset in al and machine learning: these are all capable of providing computing facilities and al competences that allow scien - tists of any discipline to realise complex and computationally demanding al experiments: communities: italian researchers participate in all major al international research networks, including the top rated eu networks, such as claire, ellis confederating several al laboratories all over europe and the networks of excellence under the eu horizon  ict- portfolio, namely humane-al-net; tailor, ai4me - dia, elise and vision: italy is one of the founding members of global partnership on al (gpai) as the result of an idea developed within the g7, under the canadian and french presidencies this partnership aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice in al. italy has also a remarkable tradition of national scientific research associations, such as alxia, cvpl and ailc in particular; alxia is the italian association of artificial intelligence, founded in ,and a member association of eurai, the european association of artificial intelligence: many italian researchers have covered important roles in the eurai board. cvpl is the association of computer vision, pattern recognition and machine learning founded in , devoted to theory and application of al for multi- media data, connected with the international association of pattern recognition. ailc is the italian association of computational linguistics, mainly devoted to research in natural language processing: the first two cycles of phd-alit have been co-funded with about € million bv the ministry of university and research and with the same amount by the universities and research organizations participating in programme: claire ellis units, three of them in italy in genova; torino and modena  public the



at the same time, however; the italian al research ecosvstem presents four main weaknesses this strategy will address, and namelv: parceled growth of research labs despite the international excellence of the italian al research community, the persistent issue of scale; critical mass and interdisciplinary integration of research labs, together with the scarce public/private national funding of fundamental research; represent a serious potential risk for the coun- try's competitiveness. poor talent attraction. while new talents' development is adequate in italy, talent attraction is poor; with few foreign talents coming to work in italy: no special strategies have been effective, until now; to support the attraction of foreign talents. significant gender gap. a survev of  of cinilab aiis national assembly among its members shows that only .% of al researchers are women, compared to close to % in stems limited patent capacity: italy vields far less patents per paper than eu peers: b. knowledge transfer centres alongside universities and research nodes, italy has a wide network of knowledge transfer centers, promoted by industrial associations and institutions at the national and local level. among these; it is worth mentioning + digital innovation hubs (dihs) promoted by confindustria, + punti impresa digitale promoted by italian chambers of commerce, and  competence promoted bv the ministry of economic development: these centres, which belong to the network industria ., offer services ranging from sensibilization and awareness campaigns, to tech- nologv assessment; strategic roadmapping and emplovee  training: in addition to these national resources, italy is active in the eu-dihs network which will function as one-stop shops that help companies dvnamically respond to the digital challenges and become more competitive. survey from cini lab aiis national assemblv :  women and  men among a total  members; for overall stem figures; see elsevier foundation  report: gender in research cited in ansa july z4th  confindustria; digital innovation hubs italian chambers of commerce; punto impresa digitale centri di competenza ad alta specializzazione mise european commission; european digital innovation hubs overall; centres



c technology and solution providers the italian ecosvstem is characterised by a varietv of technologv providers which specialise in a variety of al solu- tions. as of february , the observatorv on al registered  italian companies offering al products and services (see figure ): the majority of them (%) offer solutions designed to be used in specific areas, i.e. healthcare, marketing and sales, finance and cybersecurity: one quarter (%) are more general in nature, providing for example advanced analysis of structured and unstructured data for purposes that may concern forecasting classification, natural language processing computer vision; human-al interaction in various application areas. about a third of these companies are start-ups: the remaining companies are divided between svstem integrators (about %) and consulting companies (about %), most of which are either medium or large companies: few of them are cloud providers offering al solutions and companies offering sensing and edge computing for efficient computing or storage dedicated to al. cloud providers are limited in number but tend to be among the largest plavers. the largest among them offer services in critical infrastructures management or cyberse- curity: figure : italian companies offering al products, by sector svstem integrators and consulting companies % generalists % % vertical solution providers others % in addition, several large corporations are creating in-house al research labs to create solutions and products that mav cater to their business, their clients or both: companies are most active in the energv; security, aerospace, telecommunications, insurance; banking; cloud and household and personal care (hpc) sectors the italian entrepreneurial ecosystem registers a growing number of start-ups with al expertise; cini lab aiis in  surveved  universitv spin-offs or start-ups connected with research centres, focusing on machine or deep learning; big data analytics and human-al interaction: this figure is particularly relevant as al is one of the sectors where startups concentrate the most; showing a national proclivity for the sector: politecnico di milano, italian observatorv on al  'registered in the innovative startups section of the business register of the chamber of commerce thev' lastly;



despite the considerable number of plavers start-ups, the al market in italy is still verv limited in size and this is negatively affecting the growth of our companies and their investment capability: considering the fast develop- ment rate of al, this represents a weakness that should be addressed: d. private and public user organisations lastly, the italian ecosvstem is composed of private and users organisations. as for private organisations, in  according to a research conducted by the school of management of politecnico di milano, % of medium-large italian companies declare that thev have started atleast one al project: the sectors that show the greatest diffusion of fully operational projects are manufacturing (% of total projects started); banking-finance (%) and insurance (%). table : al projects within italian medium-large companies, by sector categorv value manufacturing % banking/finance % insurance % utilitv % travel % public administration % transport/logistics % telco % others %  public



in , the artificial intelligence private market in italv reached a value of € million; an increase of % over  but that still places italy's contribution to europe's al market below its gdp contribution (ca. % vs. ca. %). within the italian market, € million (%) was commissioned bv italian companies, while € million (%) was project exports the politecnico study highlights the following classes of al based solutions: intelligence data processing (% of the expenditurel, natural language processing (%) , recommendation systems(%) , intelligent rpa, chatbot _ virtual assistant and computer vision (%). with regards to the public sector; understanding what is happening in the field of digital transformation is crucial in order to imagine how al can create svnergies with the process of digitising the country: according to the study e-go- vernment benchmark  bv the european commission; italy is characterised by alow level of penetration (% vs. % of euz7+uk) and a medium level of digitisation (% vs. % eu +uk) therefore, there is still a gap between the supply of digital services and their actual use: although the digitisation level is in line with the performance of other european countries with similar environments, online services are not fully widespread all over the country: italian observatory on al, , mercato  delartificial intelligence in italia: applicazioni e trend di sviluppo  ""european al spending data from statista; gdp figures from imf weo  'european commission; egovernment benchmark

. the anchoring: an eu centred ai over the last decade; industry and society have been radically changed by the ongoing digital revolution: in this context; the eu has recognized al as an area of strategic importance with the potential of becoming a driver of economic development: in april , the european commission put forward a european strategy on alin its communication 'artificial intelli- gence for europe' com() as of its digital single market strategv: this strategy delineates the following aims: boosting the eu's ai technological and industrial leadership and al uptake across the economy; both in the private andnd sectors_ preparing for socio-economic changes brought about by al. establishing an appropriate legal framework based on ethical values and principles. following this, the european commission and the member states put forward a 'coordinated plan on artificial intel- ligence' com() in december  with the stated goal of maximizing aj investments' impact both at european and national levels and strengthening synergies and cooperation among member states: to this end, member states were strongly encouraged to develop their own national al strategies as a first step to achieve these aims. this strategic programme responds to this encouragement more recently, the eu commission published the ' review of the coordinated plan on artificial intelligence' with a view to strengthen member states' competitive landscapes. the review reports actions taken bv the european commission so far within the framework of the mff - programming and sets concrete proposals and recommendations for further joint actions between the eu and member states: the plan was accompanied bv signi- ficant investments: €. billion (-) and € billion/vear (after ) to be allocated in the following funding framework programmes horizon europe aspects contributing to al (data and cloud infrastructures for ai) development of al technologies (especially in cluster , where the partnership al-big data and robotics has been launched, and bottom-up approaches like eic, msca, erc etc:) use of al in other clusters contributing to ai (. health, . civil security for society, . climate, energv and mobility; . food and natural resources) and in all missions. digital europe strategic objective 2_ ai-related activities in s04 (skills) and s05 (european digital innovation hub) to support the implementation of the plan outlined above, the european commission launched the project ""al watch"" in ,with the goal of monitoring industrial, technological and research capacity, as well as national policy initiati- ves. furthermore; the projectkeeps track ofupdates and technological developments of al worldwide; assesses their impact in the economy, societv and public services its first national strategies' review was published in february . the last step taken bv the european commission, in april ,is the launch of the proposal for a european regula-  tion on al which aims to introduce a common regulatory and legal framework based on a well-defined risk-based assessment of each field of application. the initiative also proposes the introduction of a european artificial intelli- board, which will encourage national cooperation and ensure that the regulation is respected:  european commission; excellence and trust in artificial intelligence  proposagisra regulation of the exzo8 ean parliament and of the council laving down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (artificial intelligence act) and amending certain legislative acts com/ final  kev part public gence



alis therefore a priority for the european union: italy aims to be aligned with this european priority and integrate its strategic programme within this european approach. . guiding principles this national strategic programme for artificial intelligence defines a coherent and holistic framework of initiatives to support the development of a national al ecosvstem. its design is inspired bv five guiding principles. italy's al isa european ai. in line with the eu coordinated plan on artificial_ 'intelligence;' the italian strategic programme stems from the awareness that only through common and coordinated actions europe will be able to compete globally and work towards strategic autonomy: therefore, this programme reflects the four sets of proposals put forward by the  eu coordinated plan on al. first, it sets enabling condi- tions for al's development and uptake bv focusing on cooperation, data and computing infrastructure. second, it leverages on existing italian hpc and data-management infrastructure: third, it aims atnurtu- ring talents and adheres to thejoint effort for improving and adopting the harmonised set of rules for ai proposed bv the ai act fourth, it identifies priority sectors where to build strategic leadership. italy will be a global research and innovation hub of al, to guarantee future economic growth and strategic autonomv; it is essential for italy to boost its al research and development ecosystem and  leapfrog at the forefront of al developments. accordinglv, this strategic programme will invest in frontier research and applications to develop al methodologies and techniques of tomorrow: italv's al will be human-centred, trustworthy and sustainable' technologies mustnot promote econo- mic growth per se, but inclusive and sustainable growth, in line with the principles contained in article  of the italian constitution and the united nations sustainable development goals. this means that al development must be centred around economic and social inclusion, human rights as well as environ -  mental sustainability: al must be designed and implemented in responsible and transparent manner; based on trustand robustness so thatit can be safely adopted in every sector and be capable of respon - ding to societal challenges: to this aim, italy adheres to the ""ethics guidelines for trustworthy al- guidance and implementation program"" defined by the high level expert group on al. italian companies will become leaders of al-based research, development and innovation. the digital transformation of our entrepreneurial ecosystem isa must; if italy wants to keep up with the most deve- loped and innovative nations to that end, this programme fosters the development; implementation and adoption of alsolutions. public-private partnerships will be instrumental in finding appropriate synergies between research bodies and enterprises with the aim of increasing italv's technologv transfer capabili- ties and thus competitiveness.  italv's public administrations will govern with al and will govern ai; the use and impact of al in the public sector revolves around the dual dimensions of governance 'with and of' al. on the one hand, italy's  government will improve its internal processes and policies thanks to a responsible use of data and al technologv: on the other hand; the governmentis committed to governing al and mitigating its potential risks, especially to safeguard human rights and ensure an ethical deplovment of ai.  european commission; , eu-white paper on al  'according to the national plan of research -  'european commission; ethics guidelines for trustworthy al  ""european commission; artificial intelligence in public services  kev ""



these guiding principles are not separate pillars. offer an ambitious vision of the future of al in italy and an integrated approach that aimsat stimulating all those factors that can contribute to the development ofa favourable ecosvstem: industrial changes will lead to societal ones and both of these, in turn; will stimulate fundamental and challenge-driven research: the strategic programme is set to support all of these aspects. . objectives and priority sectors given the challenges laid out in the prior chapter, as well as italv's competitive position in the field of al, this strategic programme lavs out six objectives with a view to boosting italy's strengths while mitigating its weaknesses: these objectives are: objectives objective . advance frontier research in al, both fundamental and applied, with a view to generating impact on important priority sectors of industry; public sector; society, and environment: a multidiscipli- nary approach must be incentivized, where research coexists with industrial and social innovation gene - rating true innovation ecosystems. objective . reduce al research fragmentation by helping the al ecosystems achieve critical mass and by fostering network collaborations, making scientific excellence coexist with social cohesion and territo- rial inclusiveness. objective . develop and adopt human-centred and trustworthy al in the public and private sector; promoting the societal acceptability of al solutions, their compliance to regulation of al, while supporting the development and design of responsible al technologv and svstems  objective . increase al-based innovation and the development of al technologv by fostering indu- strial investments and partnerships that drive excellent science out to the market; hence facilitating the uptake of al in smbs: objective . develop al-driven policies and services in the public sector by boosting sector inno- vation; the adoption of al solutions and the cooperation between research centres, industries, and public bodies. objective . create, retain and attract al talent in italy by promoting all levels of education in al, crea- anew generation of holistic al researchers and innovators, making italy an attractive al destination for qualified human capital from abroad, with a particular attention to diversity and gender balance: together with this strategv's six objectives, italy is committed to investing in eleven priority sectors: these sectors include those where italv already hasa competitive advantage, such as manufacturing; culture, agri-food and health, but also industries that are strategic to the country's technological development; such as national security, it and the environment: pa dlle   they public  ting 



 



priority sectors industry and manufacturing: al will enable the italian manufacturing sector; the second largest in europe and seventh largest in the world, to introduce innovative processes, products and business models to the market while maintaining (or increasing) its global competitive edge. education system. as artificial intelligence is transforming everv aspect of our lives we need to educate all people to this technology through a new education and training plan to understand, reinforce, integrate and disseminate al technologv: al should be an important topic at all education levels. at the same time, it can constitute a powerful instrument for a fruitful transformation of the national education svstem to develop personalized learning plans while ensuring fairness and trustworthiness. agri-food: through al, italv's thriving agri-food sector has the potential to increase further its competiti- ve position by developing precision agriculture; thus avoiding overproduction and waste; increasing food safety and reducing emissions from land and agriculture culture and tourism. advanced technologies will further increase italy's touristic attractiveness by crea- ting new synergies between cultural and creative industries, producers, managers and users of italy's vast cultural heritage: these technologies enable; for instance, continuous monitoring and preventive restoration of cultural heritage, monitoring and alert svstem for landscape heritage; customisation of services to better meet demand, virtual tours of tourist destinations to allow for better informed choices of travel destination, simultaneous translators for the description of places and monuments visited, geolocalised services for tourists health and wellbeing: in the field of healthcare; al applications boost productand process innovation bv exchanging and aggregating information that is currently scattered in a multitude of public and largelv underused databases al applications will help meet the new needs arising from an ageing italian popu - lation: moreover; will have a significant impact on the population at risk of severe diseases such as degenerative, oncological, and viral diseases, and increase social inclusion of disadvantaged groups. a few application examples are medical devices and services in screening and diagnostic areas such as omics and medical imaging, new drugs and vaccines, tracking and treating people, supporting patient care (diagnosis and prognosis), and predictive models of healthcare needs: environment, infrastructures and networks. al solutions will have a significant impact on preserving resources, reducing emissions; better managing traffic flows and related risks, strengthening the circu - lar economy and better preventing natural disasters. more generally, al will be a fundamental ally in accelerating the ecological transition, a pillar of italv's recovery and resilience plan and european union's recoverv efforts: in addition; al may have an enabling role also in the highly strategic development of  networks asit can help improve network performance as well as reduce capital expenditures associated  with its infrastructure deplovment/management . a few application examples are monitoring and intel - ligent management of networks and consumption, monitoring and predictive management of the waste cvcle; situational and predictive analvsis of hydrogeological instabilitv:  see for instance, report by ericsson on al applications to 5g networks  thev



banking, finance, and insurance: modern al technologies will allow banks and insurers to improve inat least two wavs: first; will increase the quality of services offered to customers and reduce their costs through a higher level of personalisation and security of transactions. second, al applications will strengthen fraud prevention svstems and simplify the fulfilment of intermediary obligations through the adoption of mechanisms for detecting suspicious behaviour and analysing data and documents. public administration: in the near future; al will optimise bureaucratic processes, offering better servi-  ces to citizens and businesses and reducing costs for better services and performance: furthermore, with its databases and innovative tools for purchasing; investment and regulation, the pa is called upon to play an active role in the al revolution in the private sector for the benefit of the community (e:g: open pa data; geolocation tools, purchase of al products and services, funds for al, experimentation of al solu- tions) the pa could benefit from al solutions concerning flow management; virtual assistants and chat- bots, predictive analysis of business risks and support for the examination of incentive applications, support in the fight against tax evasion and other forms of illegalitv, evaluation of past policies and impact analysis of experiments: smart cities, areas and communities. the covid - pandemic has shown that the digital ecosvstem is essential to support all citizens, whether live in cities or rural areas al will enable italian residents; wherever live; to gain access to communities and services, while reducing costs. finally, al technolo- doc gies will enable italy to reduce traffic and limit congestion thus also contributing to reining in the effects of one of the most polluting activities in the country: a few examples are smart parking, traffic manage- ment and signage control, self-driving vehicle management systems, lighting management and optimi- sation of transport, as well as monitoring of bridges and buildings, home automation for buildings: national security: the importance of al for the national securitv of a country has been growing steadily in the last five hence, italy is fully committed to investing in al applications that ensure the securi- tv of its citizens. this includes individual and national cybersecurity, where al has been contributing to the development of new-generation detection and resolution software information technologies the success of applications of al in the sectors described above strongly depends on a high level of innovations in it crucial fields impacting al, such as sensing, reasoning and search, natural language processing; computer vision, human-al interaction, and edge computing: the  broad field of it has a crucial role in ensuring a high level of innovation for implementing competitive al in all different applications: for this reason, a special effort will be devoted to supporting the birth and growth of italian it companies:  as stated in the white paper on artificial intelligence at the service of citizens published by the al task force  with a specific focus eecfecbloglegss on methods for the henaeaytsriong,t2o3388386895r5688 of information, ""atonabig daerviceages, video and their processing knowledge extraction, as well as tanguage and text process services_  thev thev thev public vears. and and

. applications as evidenced in the introductory chapters, the italian al ecosystem suffers from low patenting and a slow technologv transfer process. in addition, italian firms, large and small, have so far been slow to adopt al solutions resulting in an al market of limited size. to address these challenges, this strategv proposes a set of policies aimed at broadening the breadth of al applica- tion in industries and society, as well as measures to foster the birth and growth of innovative al enterprises. in addi- tion, these policies are meant to insist on priority areas and accompany the growth of sectors that have so far shown potential in al development and adoption. all initiatives share common issues and targets: to pav particular attention to smaller companies, those operating in the most peripheral and disadvantaged geographical or socioeconomic contexts, focusing on the priority sectors (section .) and on national strategic sectors (critical infrastructures, sectors defined in ""decreto golden power""): to increase the number of female al entrepreneurs and experts, as well as attracting foreign al-based start-ups and practitioners with economic incentives to be applied in all of the initiatives outlined below: to align all al policies related to data processing, aggregation, sharing and exchange, as well as data securitv with the national strategy for cloud and with the initiatives underway at eu level, starting with the european data strategv and the recent proposal for a data governance act and al act; to that end, this strategy identifies two areas of intervention that we deem to be of highest impact as well as most strategic: d: al for more modern enterprises: e: al for a more modern administration. d. al for more modern enterprises the impact of al on businesses will be of enormous relevance and should concern all enterprises in fact; al implies a real revolution in their modus operandi, from internal processes and customer relations to the development of new al-based products and services. in turn, al implies that italian corporates would need to transform their workforce as well as processes, new talent; upskilling the existing workforce and making sure such transition is carried out with the most effective and responsible use of al solutions: overall, the proposed initiatives aim at: supporting the process of highly skilled al personnel in private companies, so as to reinforce their . transitions process (machinery, hw, sw and people), increasing the adoption of al solutions in private companies, so as to increase their competitiveness, helping start-ups and spin-offs to scale up, avoid the ""vallev of death' and support their national and interna- tional growth, establishing a regulatory context that may help the experimentation and the certification of reliable al products and services that have passed such experimentation.  public hiring hiring

vision czech republic, the country of robots the czech republic is a country of ingenious people. it is these people that we must build our future prosperity on. the government has committed itself to becoming one of europe's innovative leaders and a country of the techno- logical future within twelve years. the national al strategy you are holding in your hands is one of the important steps towards this objective. artificial intelligence, which includes smart programs and various machines from robots in factories, through algorithms in banks, to self-driving cars in the streets, is the future. and the czech republic wants to play an important role in it. we have all the requisites to do so extraordinary scientists and developers, we are a technology-oriented country and we meet the most stringent economic criteria. we have decided to set out on an ambitious which requires both the state and businesses to engage investment, resources, data, and, above all, cooperation to retrain staff to develop standards and international partnerships the very word robot was coined by the czech writer karel capek in . already then, it meant more than mere mechanical machines an entirely new form of technology and so- ciety: in 21st century, software robots have and significant role. already those robots are giving rise to issues of safety, ethical values and risks of abuse. successful resolution of those issues is our national priority: safe and responsible al cthe czech republic has potential to contribute to the prosperity and competitiveness of the eu as a whole. our best traditions are in industry, defence and security: we are the sixth safest country in the world, and our com- panies and developers have also succeeded in the area of protection from attacks. we are a safe cyber port in the heart of europe. therefore, our ambition is to become the centre of collaboration of the best scientists and developers in these areas and to join the european efforts in the development of artificial intelligence, with man in its centre we want al to be not only credible, but above all safe and responsible: we are going to ensure the safety of driverless cars, robots and autonomous weapons, simply wherever man and intelligent machine meet we are going to build on our past achievements in mobility and transport, military and security research as well as our historical experience. we are going to focus on protecting every person and con- sumer, their and privacy, especially the weakest ones. we are going to prevent discrimination, manipulation and misuse of al, we are going to set the rules for decision-making of algorithms about people in everyday life: we want artificial intelligence to serve all the people of europe. model country for europe however; by combining our industrial traditions, research facilities and entrepreneurial skills, we can achieve much more. in   years since the word robot was first used we want to build al research centres of european importance, and we want to be the model country for the whole of europe in automation before the czech republic'$ presidency of the eu council in . our future economic performance will depend on the focus on final manu- facturing, technological solutions and services, which are essential for value added and profits. digital transforma- tion of the economy through artificial intelligence is a huge opportunity for us, and we especially need to support small and medium-sized businesses, start-ups and domestic brands. we want to be a country where new european champions, the new bafas, emerge and which is appealing to foreign investors not for the low prices, but because of cutting-edge research, skilled workforce and friendly and predictable legislation: this is the best time for us to make bold changes are among the most stable economies, our businesses achieve unprecedented results, and our scientists are gaining increasing respect in the world. while everyone is afraid of robots and labour market turmoil are going to embrace them: we will help all employees and self-em- ployed persons with retraining and acquiring new skills. we will ensure that no one is left behind, everyone is given the chance to succeed and that everyone has a share in the benefits of the breakthrough technology: we have the highest ambitions and we are fully committed to fulfilling them. we gave the world the word robot and we have nothing to worry about at the time of robots. we have hard work ahead ofus, but am convinced that to- we are going to get our country back to where it once belonged: andrej babis prime minister of the czech republic path, great cyber rights we today, we gether ing:



introduction how to read this strategy_ the czech republic and the european union are fully aware of the fundamental importance of artificial intelligence (ai) and its use for the future development and competitiveness of national, european and global economies and societies. the national artificial intelligence strategy of the czech republic (hereinafter the ""national al strategy' ""strategy or ""nais"") is therefore primarily aimed at building on the activities and strategic documents of the eu and achieving the full potential of digital transformation. to do so, it sets out a framework of priority objectives and tools to support al development in the academic, public and private sectors, mutual cooperation and international engagement, which the czech republic has committed itself to in the declaration of cooperation on artificial intel- ligence signed on ioth april . the national al strategy follows up on and meets the objectives of the govern- ment innovation strategy - and is linked to the digital czech republic programme. it was inspired by similar foreign strategic documents concerning the al and support for the digitization of the industry and services. the strategy was prepared in close cooperation with the ministry of industry and trade, as the main coordinator, with public, private and research institutions, the general public and with the involvement of social partners. deputy prime minister and the minister of industry and trade is directly responsible for its implementation and will coordinate it through the newly established al committee (a subcommittee under the committee for the digital economy and society strategyl, which primarily includes responsible ministries and whose operational management will be con- tinuously ensured by the executive committee: the specific procedural tools and tasks for implementing the overall strategy coordination are summarized in the introduction to the strategy, under the heading 'tools and tasks' nais is based on the assumption that current trends in artificial intelligence, automation, robotics, and the related fields such as electromobility, data economy or 5g networks, are crucial for the further development of industry, services and the economy as a whole. the main horizontal objectives of the are therefore to use these state-of-the-art technologies to help the czech republic to become an innovative economy and to support domestic companies and brands and further economic growth. strengthen the safety and security of the population, increase their comfort in everyday life and ensure fast; efficient and helpful communication with the state. the overall objective is to make the czech republic again one of the world's most advanced countries. the strategy is vertically divided into seven chapters, according to the priority areas of development of artificial intel- ligence and their impacts: each of them contains a summary of the current situation, based primarily on the research report on the al potential in the czech republic and the mapping performed by the al platform of the confederation of industry: these result in specific objectives in the short; medium and long term and tools to achieve them. the objec- tives are timed mainly in relation to the eu financial framework will be linked to the implementation plans of the digital economy and society strategy and formulated as specific measures that can be implemented within a given time frame: the tools are cross-sectional for each chapter and do not have an implementation date. each chapter lists not only the responsible state administration body as the coordinator; but also the co-coordinator usually co-operat- ing with it, and other entities whose work it will coordinate for the given priority area. the objectives and tools will be reviewed after each time the objectives and tools contained in this strategy do not interfere with or replace the applicable sectoral strategies of the respective coordinators, so this strategy does not interfere with the division of coordination responsibilities among the different ministries in the sense of the competencies act: on the contrary, the purpose is to connect the responsible coordinators and co-coordinators for effective cooperation in achieving the objectives and effective overall coordination of this strategy: the to fulfil the national al strategy is primarily to support the concentration of excellent randd in al, in particular by supporting the creation of the european centre of excellence; test centre and digital innovation hubs the strat- egy will also be fulfilled by deepening cooperation with global al centres, but also by maintaining research and experts in the czech republic and, conversely, by simplifying and attracting conditions for the arrival of top foreign talent: (chapter ) : it is therefore essential to ensure funding for research, the development of start-ups, the entire al ecosystem, the transfer of know-how and the availability of resources for innovation of smes (chapter ). the driv- ing force behind digital and al transformation is the economy and it is therefore necessary to create conditions for its development: the state can contribute to this mainly by making available data, completing digital infrastructure, supporting the transformation of enterprises and introducing modern public administration services (chapter ). strategy they - period. key top



education, training and retraining, both technical and humanitarian, will play crucial role, targeting the skills need- ed in the next decade (chapter ). the training of human capital will be to the effects of al and automation on the labour market and employment; but especially the social system will also have to respond quickly and flexibly (chapter ). a significant role in development will also be played by clear legislation, ensuring the protection of fundamental rights and security as well as legal certainty for investors (chapter ) . an irreplaceable role in the use of global trends is played by the international cooperation and involvement of the czech republic, especially at eu level (chapter ). in the above-mentioned areas and in order to promote economic growth and competitiveness, public authorities need to become actively involved. above all, however, will need to do this in close cooperation with the private sector, which is without prejudice to other activities in this area, which we welcome. it is the cooperation of allthe en- tities involved that is crucial for the real fulfilment of the national al strategy and successful handling of fundamental changes for the czech economy and society: doc. ing: karel havlicek, phd,, mba deputy prime minister and minister of industry and trade key they-

introduction definition to capitalize on this potential growth: countries looking to become forerunners in new technology artificial intelligence (ai) is a diverse field of have developed national strategies aimed at computer science that is constantly  evolving: promoting the growth of al. while any brief description will fail to capture all of the nuances and capabilities of al, it is important the european union is taking initiative with a that an agreed upon definition is defined before coordinated plan on al that was released in moving on to any further analysis: for the december of . the main goal of the plan is purposes of this report; we will be using the ""for europe to become the world-leading region most recent definition released by the european for developing and deploying cutting-edge, commission on al: ethical and secure al, promoting a human-centric approach in the global ""artificial intelligence (ai) refers to systems that dis - context:' the member play intelligent behavior by analyzing their environ - states taking the ment and taking actions with some degree of autono - lead on this currently my to achieve specific goals: include france, finland, ""ai-based systems can be purely software-based, acting sweden and germany: in the virtual world (e.g. voice assistants, image analy - each strategy takes sis software, search engines, speech and face recogni - a different approach tion systems) or ai can be embedded in hardware devic - when al targeting es (e.g. advanced robots, autonomous cars, drones, or policy with focus on internet of things applications) "" scientific research; talent development; skills and education, this definition is not meant to be a complete public and private sector adoption, ethics and representation of artificial intelligence: rather, it inclusion, standards and regulations, and data be used as a launching point to base the ideas and digital infrastructure: furthermore the eu of this report off of. high-level expert group on artificial intelligence is publishing al ethics guidance document that will include recommendations on how member global impact of al states and create trustworthy al with a human- centric approach: the draft for this document if current growth trends continue; artificial was published in december of  with intelligence has the potential to become one of the finalization  happening in march of . the main contributors to global economic growth: stakeholders and member states are encouraged according to the ""artificial intelligence is the to voluntarily endorse the guidelines and they future of growth"" report done by accenture, al should serve as starting for the discussion can help double annual economic growth rates, for ethical al. boost labor productivity, and shorten the timeline to growth with various degrees of effectiveness for most countries. global economies are looking lithuanian artificial intelligence strategy  will point



lithuania is also ready to move  forward with it's own strategic plan for the future of artificial intelligence: in the fall of , a group of private and public sector representatives began meeting with the ministry of economy and innovation in lithuania to discuss the current al landscape and discuss plans for the way forward: the group consists of industry leaders, academic experts and government representatives, all with knowledge on the lithuanian al ecosystem: a landscape report released by the group in november of  highlights both the areas where lithuania is successful in al and where there is room for growth: the group is responsible for reviewing and approving the strategic guidelines and recommendations in this report: summary of the ai landscape in lithuania this section highlights some of the key findings of the analysis done for the landscape report in order to create understanding of the current situation of a in lithuania. the landscape report is separated into  parts: academic ecosystem, industry, financial and community: each part showed a set of strengths and challenges and is used as evidence for the development of the ideas:  lithuanian artificial intelligence strategy key



academic: in , information and communications technology (ict) programs in universities were the fourth most popular choice for  students; showing that there is significant interest from students in lithuania to pursue technology as a field of study: the main institutions leading the charge on al research and development are vilnius university, vytautas magnus   university and kaunas university of technology: where al is financial: concerned, the areas of focus are deep learning data mining natural language processing, game there are a few channels for receiving financial development; computer vision and robotics. investment for al projects and startups. in the while there are no unique bachelors; masters or period between  and , public sector phd program for artificial intelligence, relevant investment in al was more significant than private courseworkisdeeplyintegrated into the computer sector with a total of eur . million and eur . science majors another obstacle is the lack ofthe million respectively: in total  different al projects sophisticated hardware needed for students to received funding from ministry of economy and conduct research in al systems: innovation initiatives, totaling eur . million since . when combined with private capital brought in; the total value of projects for the last three years was over eur  million: almost all of the submitted projects that were approved industry: received funding greater than or equal to  percent of the total value of the project: al the  industry   portion   mainly focused on the academic research projects also received eur artificial intelligence industry itself. in total, there . million under the ministry of education and were  smes engaged in al product research science: private investment came primarily from and delivery: % of these were engaged in bzb venture capital firms with varying origins including product delivery: there is a significant amount lithuania; united states; france and russia. of   companies originating in  lithuania, as well as international companies with offices in the country engaged in al systems development the smes are developing products that cover a wide range of industries: development and it, internal community: data and intel, security, human resources, iot, computer vision, research; language processing, lithuania has an active artificial intelligence arnr, analytics and insights, advanced targeting; community with a handful of regular events and agriculture; medical imaging and biometrics: meetups bringing   together the   professionals working the field. around - people are attending these events, with - active working professionals. lithuanian artificial intelligence strategy



key sections the focus of lithuanian national strategic plan for artificial intelligence is split into six key sections: [] ethical and iegal core principles for the development and use of artificial intelligence; [] a break down of lithuania's position in the al ecosystem, [] integration of artificial intelligence systems across all economic sectors, [] national development of skills and competencies needed for a future with artificial intelligence, [] growth of artificial intelligence research and development, [] a responsible and efficient approach to data: [] ethical and legal core principles for the development and use of artificial intelligence having the capability to generate tremendous benefits for individuals and society, al also gives rise to certain risks that should be properly managed. given that; on the whole; als benefits outweigh its risks, we must ensure to follow the road that maximizes the benefits of al while minimizing its risks. to ensure that we stay on the right track, a human-centric approach to al is needed. trustworthy al has two components: () ethical purpose it should respect fundamental rights, applicable regulation and core principles and values and () it should be technically robust and reliable since, even with good intentions, a lack of technological mastery can cause unintentional harm: this document therefore sets out a framework of core strategically principles and main mechanisms for further ethical and legal regulation for the development and use of trustworthy al in lithuania: policy recommendations: principle to advice the public sector on ethical ai regulation and implementation: mechanism: establish al ethics committee that reviews impact of technology on fundamental rights. the committee should include representatives from academia, government; industry and ngo sector. the committee should provide (independently created) short and long-term analysis



and recommendations. these recommendations should be used to create and update existing ethical standards in lithuania. the committee should foster the development of al-related skills in the   public administration: mechanism: develop feedback mechanisms for societal input on regulations created by the public administration: mechanism: government should recognize citizens' ""understanding of al as a new civic skill:"" . principle to establish trust in the rules, laws and norms that governs al. it should be noted that currently there still is ethical and legal vacuum in lithuania; but there is no legal vacuum in europe, as europe already has some regulation in place that applies to ai. mechanism: lithuania needs to develop rules, standards; guidelines, norms and ethics principles in order to guide ethical and sustainable development of al and use of ai. mechanism: lithuania needs to work for lithuanian, european and international standards and regulations that promote the use of al and prevent risks: mechanism: as advances bring greater linkages between humans and al systems, lithuania needs to establish governing principles and policies for the study of best practices for design, construction, and use, including proper operator training for safe operation. mechanism: lithuania needs additional investments to advance al safety and security, including   explainability and transparency, trust; verification and validation, security against attacks, and long-term al safety and value-alignment: . principle to encourage transparency and fairness in al applications: al applications should be ethical, safe, reliable and transparent: achieving effective interactions between humans and al systems requires additional randd to ensure that the system design and the use of data does not lead to excessive complexity, undertrust; or overtrust: the familiarity of citizens with the al systems can be increased in many ways; to ensure that the human has a understanding of the al system's capabilities and what the al system can and cannot do. to address these concerns, certain human- centered mechanism should be improved. mechanism: support research to minimize bias in al systems: mechanism: create quality marks for relevant companies that abide by standards set forth by al ethics committee. publish results publicly: mechanism: facilitatethe creation of a national interdisciplinary center on alto promote discussions surrounding the ethics of ai. good



mechanism: algorithms, including those based on deep learning; are opaque to users; thus, lithuania needs to establish the safeguarding mechanism that researchers would develop systems that are transparent; and intrinsically capable of explaining the reasons for their results to users: . principle to encourage ethics by design: mechanism: encourage schools at the high school level to discuss ethical implications of technology: mechanism: encourage universities to develop courses on the ethical implications of technology for as many disciplines as possible. ethical education must constitute integral part of higher technical and non-technical education in al and related programs of universities and colleges mechanism: request university it and engineering programs to take a course on the ethics of 'technology: mechanism: facilitate society-wide discussion of al and its ethical implications: mechanism: develop mediation capabilities to support vulnerable populations: mechanism: actively workwith the principleson data infrastructureto ensure protection of privacy and security: [] a break down of lithuania's position in the ai ecosystem; this section seeks to strengthen lithuania's national and international a network through two different cross-sections: conception of place and division of sector. the national and international al network can be conceptualized through  levels of place: lithuania the innermost network consists of two central hubs: vilnius and kaunas regional cities constitute network nodes this layer seeks to encourage the existing al ecosystem and promote future growth: this could be done by supporting new al applications; promote existing applications, and the sharing of knowledge (ex: al meetups, conferences, online portal with a list of relevant companies) global lithuania the second innermost network seeks to strengthen ties with al experts in lithuanias diaspora. global lithuania is drawn out as a separate layer to highlight lithuania's relatively unique diaspora positioning (especially considering its history, size and activism in lithuania) this layer seeks to identify al experts in the diaspora, to create and maintain a registrar of diaspora al experts contacts, and to facilitate the transfer of knowledge and competence this transfer of knowledge and competence can occur indirectly (ex: highlighting success stories to build trust; attract new investors) and directly (ex: inviting individuals to participate as advisors on al related committees):  lithuanian artificial intelligence strategy many



baltic region the third innermost network aims to develop and maintain relationships with lithuanias neighbors: latvia and estonia. this layer highlights the countries' shared modern history and geopolitical situation: the network could be strengthened through pan-baltic initiatives such initiatives could also promote the regions shared values on a stage. nordic-baltic region the first outermost network positions lithuania with its extended neighbors. this network can similarly be strengthened through more shared initiatives and transfer of knowledge european union the second outermost network identifies lithuania within the european union framework and legislation: global the third outermost network frames lithuania within a global context. lithuania seeks to take an active role in the global artificial intelligence community: this could include organizing an international al conference, encouraging international companies to open initiatives (such as labs) in lithuania, encouraging local al experts to participate in international al conferences; and so forth: the national and international al network can be conceptualized through  sectors: academia public sector private sector ngo independent al enthusiasts [] integration of artificial intelligence systems across all economic sectors. a simulation done by mckinsey global institute showed that al has the potential to deliver a economic impact of an estimated $ trillion by . the adoption of al systems can be broken down further into sections for the private and public sector. private sector the private sector has long been the leader in the adoption of innovative technologies the benefits of al for business are apparent: greater work productivity, optimization of logistics, automation of routine processes, faster business decisions and more accurate consumer market prediction: by  businesses that currently use or are planning to use al systems anticipate a % increase in revenue, on average. this metric alone is ensures that a large percentage of businesses; both small and large, will attempt to integrate al systems into their operational structure in part or fully: the implementation of al systems in businesses can present unique challenges. there is a chance of high entry costs, especially for businesses that do not have the significant digital infrastructure needed as foundation for al integration. despite this, businesses that build toward integrating al systems as lithuanian artificial intelligence strategy  help global global



early as possible have a unique advantage to late comers: a greater assurance that future value will outweigh initial cost: this is due to the fact that front-runners in adoption of technological innovation have historically benefited more than those who adopt later: public sector artificial intelligence systems promise a unique set of advantages for the public sector. creative use of al can lift a countrys citizen's well being: some examples of public oriented projects include:  . crime prediction: a models can be used to discover high risk areas for crime in cities so law enforcement is better adept at servicing the population:  better services for citizens: intelligent virtual assistants can better serve citizens. 3_ al for public institutions: internal government workflow can be optimized using intelligent systems: the biggest obstacles to greater implementation of al systems in the public sectors are the barriers to innovation. public institutions are slower to adopt new technologies due to either a lack of proper funding or a slow bureaucratic procedures in order to ensure the best quality of life for citizens in the digital age, the sector will need to adopt a culture of innovation, especially in regard to ai: lithuania economic breakdown in regard to artificial intelligence; lithuania has a unique position in the global economy: according the mckinsey report; lithuania falls within the ""economies with moderate foundations"" country group: this means that even though the country has a weaker starting position than countries in the higher ranked groups; the potential for al to have economic impact is there. therefore, in order to take full advantage of the opportunities presented by artificial intelligence; lithuania must work off of its current foundation and strive to be a future leader. al growth in lithuania should be targeted in the sectors that need it the most. these sectors are identified based off of two factors: importance agriculture: to the lithuanian economy and potential for al to an area that is often slow to technological have a significant impact in the sector. advancement; agriculture plays a vital role in the lithuanian economy: there are examples of al being used successfully in agriculture including: manufacturing: robotic automation of crop harvesting intelligent analysis of soil conditions and prediction of manufacturing is the largest sector of the weather patterns and crop sustainability. sector lithuanian economy, generating ,% of the leaders in agriculture need to be made aware of countrys gdp. the biggest challenges faced by the potential of al so can learn how it can the lithuanian manufacturing sector are the low benefit their operation and apply accordingly: levels of labor productivity: artificial intelligence systems can mitigate these challenges by automating routine tasks togetherwith intelligent robotics systems, the manufacturing sector looks to reap some of the biggest benefits from al. healthcare: incentivizing the integration of al systems now will the recent   adoption of a national electronic help the lithuanian manufacturing sector remain health record  system has helped modernize competitive in the regional and global markets. the healthcare   system in lithuania. an  aging population ensures care providers have a growing number of patients assigned to them, causing an  lithuanian artificial intelligence strategy public key many they

mechanism: assist public institutions in implementing al systems that help benefit citizens and improve workflow: mechanism: establish a lithuanian artificial intelligence advisory board that will assist government in decisions on future al policy: the board can be split into national and international levels: mechanism: create public-partnerships that create better conditions for development of al systems. principle  to target key economic sectors that will benefit the most from artificial intelligence systems adoption: mechanism: develop individual approaches for al innovation in the manufacturing; agriculture; healthcare; transportation, and energy sectors. mechanism: research into other sectors of industry in which the adoption of al systems can create the most benefit: [] national development of skills and competencies needed for a future with artificial intelligence in an era where the requirements to enter the job market are constantly shifting; a greater aptitude for continuous learning is needed: widespread application of al systems presents a serious dilemma for the labor force: the robotization and automation of work tasks traditionally considered to require human input: as al becomes more developed, cheaper to produce and easier to implement; more companies will have to integrate al systems in order to remain competitive. this will undoubtedly lead to a shift in the job market and a decrease in the availability of routine non-creative job tasks. some job markets are at greater risk than others, especially service; sales and construction according to the automation, skills use and training report done by oecd; in lithuania the work tasks of the median laborer have a % chance of being automated. this positions lithuania as the second most country with the highest chance of job automation, behind only the slovak republic: to prepare citizens, three-point approach should be implemented to target technical skill development in school children, students in higher education and those currently employed: the adaptation to the shift in labor markets should start with reevaluating the curriculum currently being taught at schools a greater emphasis needs to be placed on teaching the technical skills needed for future where most work is augmented with ai. this is especially true for lithuania's regional districts, which need greater educational support than city centers in regard to new technologies. these are also the areas where the labor market is composed of jobs that are most susceptible to automation as the majority of the regional economy is based on manufacturing: the exploration of  lithuanian artificial intelligence strategy



stem fields should be encouraged for students to develop a positive relationship with technology: the second point to target is higher education. rather than replacing the current academic structure, more emphasis should be made on supplemental course work that teaches al and technologies for students in programs that do not traditionally require it: studies in fields that have a high risk of automation and change should have classes that teach the fundamental skills needed to adapt their workflow to meet the demands of ai. the current labor force also needstohave the toolsneeded to succeed in a futurewith ai. opportunities for vocational training need to be created, prioritizing those with jobs and occupations that have the greatest risk of automation: the focus should be on how to augment and optimize current work with al, rather than re-training for a different occupation: this will allow the current labor force to remain relevant; as the new generation prepares for work with ai. leadership should communicate the positives of al and the potential for increase of productivity and time for tasks that require critical thinking, rather than the possibility of job loss. policy recommendations: principle  to develop the skills needed for a future with al from the beginning of education: mechanism:_ public-private partnership where school children are taken to businesses that are creating innovative al products to be shown the new technologies being worked on; mechanism: create classworkfor children that will have al basicsas a learning objective: mechanism: focus on a development oftechnical skills for school children in lithuania's regional districts. mechanism: modernize the teaching of stem subjects, especially mathematics. mechanism: trainanewgenerationofteacherstobothhavehightechnicalcompetencies themselves and the ability to instruct students on how to use new technologies. principle  to provide students in higher education learning opportunities for ai: mechanism: a semester course in university that teaches al basics and how can be applied in students chosen field of study: mechanism: identification of areas of studythatleadtojobswith high risk of automation: creation of supplemental coursework for these areas that teaches positive ways their work can be augmented with ai. they



principle  to ensure the current labor force has the competencies needed for a shifting job market. mechanism: creation of vocational training programs in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. prioritization should be on developing programs for occupations with the highest number of employees at risk of job tasks automated: mechanism: creation of a massively accessible online training program in artificial intelligence that will teach citizens the basics of al, as well as communicate the impact that it will have on the future. [] growth of artificial intelligence research and development sustainable growth of artificial intelligence systems requires an infrastructure of related research and development (randd): in recent years, countries that have invested the most in a randd have emerged as leaders. high levels of randd growth can be accomplished in two distinct ways: significant private investment into al randd in countries that have large technology companies; such as the united states, or direct government investment; in the case of china and the european union: in the eu, france has committed a eur . billion plan to stimulate the al ecosystem, with the bulk of the investment going to al research: however; this is dwarfed by the chinese government's new generation of artificial intelligence development plan that looks to invest uss150 billion in the next few years: smaller states do not have the resources to match this level of investment; which is why it is important for them to tailor individual strategies that are more focused and work for them: research and development needs to be targeted toward artificial intelligence on a national level; if lithuania seeks to be a leader in al. a well-outlined and structured program will help to draw international talent; as well as help retain lithuanias research leaders in ai. since ,the lithuanian government financed eur . million worth of projects in artificial intelligence systems, which were for private sector organizations creating innovative solutions. in addition, academic research projects in artificial intelligence received eur . million. while investment is significant; it is unstructured and relies on existing initiatives for innovation financing: if lithuania seeks to remain competitive in the global market for al research, the government a strategically organized plan for financing al randd that is both direct in approach and encompassing in scope. currently, all research done in lithuania is linked together in the lithuanian roadmap for research infrastructures the roadmap highlights research infrastructure in the areas of social sciences and humanities; biomedical sciences, environment sciences, energy, materials and analysis centers, physical and technology sciences and e-infrastructures: while lithuania has research centers for technically relevant areas iike chemistry (centre of innovative chemistry [inochemas]) high- performance computing (lithuanian grid infrastructure for high-performance computing [litgrid- hpc]) and mechatronics (research infrastructure of mechatronics [mechatronika]); there is no center  lithuanian artificial intelligence strategy having global



that focuses primarily on ai. other countries, such as czech republic; demark; france, germany, ireland; netherlands; sweden; switzerland and the united kingdom have dedicated al research centers working with the latest technologies in order to remain relevant in the global al community, lithuania must consider the possibility of financing a center or hub for al research: policy recommendations: principle  to create a level of excellence in research and development for artificial intelligence systems. mechanism: create a dedicated artificial intelligence research-funding program that focuses on the key elements outlined in this report: mechanism: meet the standards set out by the european commission of increasing funding into al research and development projects by % by the end of . mechanism: establish a national a research center. mechanism: analyze the ability for one of lithuania's digital innovation hubs (dih) to be a leader in research of innovative al systems: mechanism: integrate alresearchanddevelopmentfundingintothe smart specialization  investment plan: principle  to create a high-level educational environment that will encourage continued research in al: mechanism: create an al fast track online portal for prospective students that will list all of the university programs that focus on al. mechanism: plan the first ever lithuanian masters program thatwill focus on al systems as the main topic of study. mechanism: fund academic phd research in artificial intelligence systems. mechanism: increase funding for university hardware required for artificial intelligence research: work with universities to present a cost-benefit  analysis of funding the purchase of hardware in a physical space, or using cloud-based services mechanism: refocus current it programs in lithuania's universities. modernize the qualifications needed to pursue an academic career in it related subjects. mechanism: promote joint research in al between private organizations and public educational institutions:



greater accessibility to data is one of the driving factors of the artificial intelligence expansion in recent years: al methodologies like learning natural language processing and data mining require large data sets in order to develop working products. the bigger and more complete the data set upon which an al system is being tested, the more reliable the final product: data serves as the foundation upon which artificial intelligence systems can be built: al requires that data is not only accessible; but also of high quality: the higher the quality of the data set; the more precise the al system will be. unfortunately; it is often the case, that public data that is collected by different administrations is fragmented with limited accessibility: while the private sector has the ability to set their own individual standards based on business needs, the public sector will need to adopt a unified approach to data management that is favorable for use in al systems. this can be accomplished by introducing the data maturity model to the sector and ensuring that all institutions strive to better their data management: the lithuanian government has initiatives aimed at creating an open data ecosystem in the public sector. an online portal opendata gov.it exists where users may upload data; however, the lack of data literacy limits usability: % of data is uploaded in a closed format; and up to % data sets uploaded are single purpose and not regularly updated: furthermore; the portal does not guarantee that any data will be uploaded, as it is up to administration at public organizations to determine when and what data will be uploaded: some public institutions have their own separate open data portals, which creates a disconnect and a lack of centralization: this makes it difficult to monitor if data is being provided correctly, as well as complicating the process for accessing the data: a centralized hub for data administration in the public sector would unify lithuania's approach to data and promote more involvement from the public sector in the open data ecosystem: the hub will create standards for data literacy that will ensure data is managed correctly: policy recommendations: principle to create a stable and al-friendly data environment, with focus on the public sector: mechanism: sandbox environments that will open up sector data for the development of artificial intelligence tools. the purpose of the sandbox is to provide individuals and organizations that are seeking to develop al systems access to data. mechanism: establish funding for a public sector data team that will oversee the open data initiatives: the data team will have certain tasks including: enforcing standards of data management: creating an environment for al systems development: educating institutions with a focus on data literacy: key deep public public public key



mechanism: data scientists and experts need to work together with lithuania's current data team in order to create a model for data management: the model will serve as a basis for revisions to current data infrastructure and future  principle to ensure that lithuania's data meets international standard requirements: mechanism: ensure research data used for al systems meets the requirements of the european union's fair data management in horizon  project: this will enable research data to be ""findable; accessible; interoperable and reusable (fairy'. mechanism: ensure that private and public entities using data for al development purposes comply with the european union's general data protection regulation (gdpr) lithuanian artificial intelligence strategy  updates.

introduction why is al important? the process of digital transformation of society and the algorithm economy are the greatest developmental challenges in the 21st century: public and commercial services and industries need to be saturated with data to enter the era of artificial intelligence. in recent years, data has become one of the most important materials. the acquisition, collection, analysis, processing and informed use of data and the continued development of al algorithms are becoming a fundamental competence of economies and countries alike. this competence determines their place in the global supply chain and the added value associated with data processing in the fields where artificial intelligence is used. data-driven economy changes the rules of growth that we knew in the past: this is a great opportunity for polish companies and polish economy, because these new solutions and services have been developed and implemented only recently, and in addition, it is much easier to build one's position in a new, fledgling industry: this means that the polish society can stop being just a consumer of others' inventions, while poland can become a country of inventors and creators of new solutions. it is also an opportunity to make another developmental leap and uplift poland from the group of middle-income countries to the group of highest-income states. if poles are to become a prosperous society, they must take advantage of all the opportunities and benefits coming with the development of al, while having an impact on the drafted regulations and laws regarding the operation of robots and self-learning systems, which will become increasingly important in our lives, work, education and leisure activities. global trends and risks, such as the sars-cov- virus pandemic, have a great impact on the accelerated digitalisation of many areas of our lives. the manner and extent of the use of al- based technologies requires further in-depth reflection, based on a substantive debate involving both experts in new technologies and ethics, as well as humanities and social science scholars. al will also have a impact on energy, climate and the environment at al-based solutions in smart will allow integration and stabilisation of distributed energy generation and renewable energy sources, efficient management of energy consumption, and thanks to increased flexibility and controlofthe power system, introducing dynamic pricing formulas while increasing reliability level and quality of electricity supplied to the customers. algorithmic economics tells us that much of the work in the future ~will be done by robots or multifunctional systems  with minimal human intervention: poland's advantage in the form of competitive wages compared to highly developed countries will cease to matter. if poland and polish companies do not invest and develop solutions in the field of al, robotics, as well as developing modern hardware and software solutions, other countries will do that first: as a result we will no longer be competitive in the european and global markets. for example, factory that once employed  people will be able to manufacture the same items, while reducing the number of operators to  people: services such as call centres, accounting, travel agencies, diagnostic laboratories and financial consultancy are already increasingly supported by al-based solutions, and thus traditional jobs are gradually being replaced by smart software. thus, it is necessary to ensure conditions for the upskilling of the general public in order to counteract technological unemployment:  key large: grids



the development of new communication technologies, such as , will make the progress and development of automation and robotics even more dynamic, as we have seen in the case of communications, which underwent such a revolutionary transformation in recent years. the modern phone is a very different device than it was even  years ago. transformation at a similar scale awaits not only devices such as the electricity meter or cars, but also entire industries such as energy, transport, education, defence and agriculture: al-based solutions will play central role and their importance will continue to grow in smart grids, logistics and transportation, food production, autonomous cars and smart cities: societies that produce and effectively implement new solutions, in particular in the area of artificial intelligence, will enjoy a better growth than those, who will merely use them. it is also crucial that the developed al-based solutions always serve humanity at large, putting human rights and dignity first: that is why it is so important for the polish voice to be constantly heard in the global debate on al ethics, as well as on the functioning and operation of the smart or autonomous agents algorithms that determine access to public services, surveillance robots, or autonomous cars. in the near future; we will see a drastic increase in the use of al-based solutions in virtually all areas of life and the economy. at the same time, this is the first industrial revolution in history, in which we can take part as a sovereign state and free citizens. it is up to all of us to grasp the opportunities of the ongoing industrial revolution to build our wealth and increase our role in the global economy: poland's achievements we can already boast first global success stories that can make artificial intelligence a driving force for the polish economic growth: the intellectual potential of poles and their achievements to date are the foundation on which we should build further development of technology: al is a field in which poland has tangible chance of becoming one of the international leaders contributing more than what the polish gdp or population in relation to the entire global economy and population could suggest: it is a market in which know-how, intellectual property and creative skills are the main assets, and our country has them: poland regularly achieves some of the best results in the programme for international student assessment (pisa) coordinated by the oecd. in the area of mathematical reasoning, the results of the  study saw polish -year-olds score  points, or  points higher than the average for oecd countries (compared to  pointsin ). putting asian countries aside, only two european countries achieved a higher result than poland: estonia and the netherlands.

the potential of al as of now, we are witnessing a worldwide race in connection with the al. the competitiveness of economies leading the way in building high-tech solutions, including al, closely correlates with their innovation level: over the past few decades, we have been seeing a new reality being ushered in at a breakneck pace one that is no longer based on natural resources, workforce and financial capital, but rather on knowledge and intangible assets. in this new economy, the nature of investments in intangible assets digitalised information and processing models (data and  algorithms) , intellectual property (research, development, design) as well as economic competences (networking and cooperation, market understanding, training and business process re-engineering) has changed fundamentally: leading economies in the transatlantic region, such as the usa, canada, sweden, the uk, finland, france and the netherlands, are already investing more in intangible capital than in physical assets; on average, this investment amounts to around  % of gdp annually.) artificial intelligence will also enable radical new ways to access cultural heritage, while bringing about new quality of education. artificial intelligence will increasingly use data and involve human talent ushering in the end of the age of traditional means of production known since the industrial age. poland's benefits from the development of al hinge upon more than just the ability of companies and experts to deliver working solutions. a well-functioning market also needs numerous and informed customers that create demands for the products, which is particularly important with the list of al- based solutions and applications growing with every subsequent month: even today, it is hard to find single industry that is not impacted by artificial intelligence: poland is currently in a convenient position, since the country'$ economy is based on industries that can reap maximum benefits from implementing artificial intelligence: priority sectors include: public administration; construction (in particular smart buildings); cybersecurity; energy; retail and marketing; healthcare; industry; agriculture; transport and logistics. in the case ofthe priority economic sectors for al, the benefits of its implementation constitute about .% of the total gdp. ) cf. j. j. zygmuntowski, kapitalizm sieci; wydawnictwo rozruch, warsaw, .

. al and society artificial intelligence is redefining many professions due to process optimisation and automation, and as a result machines replace humans in standard and repeatable tasks on an unprecedented scale. this risks aggravating problems in socially and economically excluded regions, increasing unemployment, as well as exacerbating various forms of inequality and discrimination_ the effects of automation and process optimisation are likely to affect different populations in various ways, and their impact will be not only economic but also social and political in nature: one of the features of automation is that it replaces humans in doing tedious, repetitive and difficult tasks. it is also a way to compensate for labour shortages due to unfavourable demographic situation in developed countries. therefore, it highlights the need to support the development of workers towards performing more creative work and to get the employees working at the occupations at risk for upcoming new challenges. the ongoing social changes should be analysed using the potential of scientific methods for modelling social processes. in order to involve the society as a whole in the creation of new professions in a data-based economy, the state is responsible for creating proper conditions for people at risk of losing their jobs due to the implementation of al to gain new skills in fields compatible with market trends. preparing for these changes will also require changes in the legal framework: the issues of al-related skill development and the use of al-based tools in educational processes are the key issues of the integrated skills strategy  in poland, which is currently undergoing development: in order to develop and fully exploit the potential of artificial intelligence, it is first and foremost necessary to respond to technological developments in a flexible manner by establishing randd-friendly legal framework, creating new economic models, removing obstacles and improving the readiness of the legal system for market changes. poland also needs to ensure its ability to retain highly- specialised al workforce and attract experts from abroad entrepreneurs, researchers, and workers while maintaining a high level of protection for fundamental human rights. thus, these changes should be made in line with the european approach to human-centric and trustworthy artificial intelligence, which enables the broadest possible use and access to al-based solutions, as well as reaping their benefits, while protecting human rights at the highest possible level. therefore, these changes should be implemented in line with the european approach to trustworthy human-centric artificial intelligence, which is to create an ethical framework and recommendations for al policy and investment: in a globally competitive environment, this enables making the most of al opportunities, while mitigating social, political and economic risks potentially brought about by the use of al. one of the elements of this approach includes providing access to al-based solutions, including algorithm libraries, as well as access to the benefits stemming from the use of these technologies international organisations such as the eu and the un are working on ethical and regulatory frameworks concerning ai. these documents also cover the issue of mitigating social exclusion and avoiding inadvertent discrimination. polish  representatives should continue their participation in the work of these organisations and if possible intensify their work, pointing out the issues pertaining to human dignity and human rights, as well as practical ways of implementing these overarching values within the framework of technical and non-technical ethical rules dedicated to the evaluation of al in terms  doing

. al and innovative companies poland's prosperity depends on the growth ofthe polish economyandthe success of polish companies al-based solutions are an opportunity that needs to be seized, if poland wants to join the ranks of the world's wealthiest countries in order to pursue this objective, we will need to support the process of creating polish al-oriented companies, to use al-based solutions in everyday life and to promote cooperation between private companies and the public sector in the area of research and pilot implementations. it is also crucial to reinforce the demand side (number of orders and projects) for al- based solutions in the public sector, state-owned companies and the polish armed forces today, al-based systems can be found in many different applications from smartphones, through crm systems, all the way to the stock market: the widespread use of al-based business applications include financial risk assessment, price optimisation, customer targeting and service customisation, medical diagnostics, recommendation systems and virtual assistants, among many others_ in order to face the rapid growth of this technology and determine how best to exploit its potential and avoid risks, we should get ready to tackle specific tasks in advance: a good example of combining multiple al-based solutions in one product are autonomous vehicles, also known as self-driving cars, which combine various sensors that receive  signals from the environment; such as laser scanning, sonar, radar, gps, odometer and inertia sensors what is more, they feature machine vision technologies one of the most well-known and widespread al-based technologies in use today. precision agriculture, on the other hand, already uses decision-making algorithms digital farming systems, remote sensing, precise fertiliser application based on soil analysis and crops, real-time monitoring of crops and fertilisation evaluation make agriculture . taking care of the condition of individual plants reality: artificial intelligence also has great potential for use in cinematography in digital restoration, automatic film translation, preparing dubbing or matching film scores to individual scenes, as well as in quality assurance or editing: it also enables restoring footage from the last century back into circulation in order to make it more attractive for the audience, which leads to its increased use in the audio-visual and audio production chain various kinds of media, as well as in journalism. another benefit associated with al is that al-based systems used in autonomous transport can significantly lower the number of accidents, and as a result - the number of fatalities. in healthcare, on the other hand, al-based systems can ensure high-quality medical services, while optimising treatment time, cost and effectiveness. al in healthcare also offers the possibility to use tools that predict epidemiological situations and detect abuse. implementing simple robotics in businesses can lead to tangible savings and increased production efficiency: this allows humans to work on tasks that require skills that al-based systems do not have, or where the systems can only support work done by human workers. the data-driven economy itself is thus contributing to the emergence of new products, services and as a result _ companies, while ushering in new competencies that employees can now learn. this is an opportunity for the polish economy and our domestic companies, since it is much easier to compete with others in relatively new fields and areas for historical reasons, there are not many global companies in poland, which makes al true opportunity for all small and medium-sized  key



enterprises that want to grow. it is crucial for innovative companies that poland is as open as possible to the implementation and use of al-based solutions: thanks to the broad range of possibilities concerning the use of al-based systems in the energy sector, eu external border  protection, environmental  protection, water retention, agriculture, healthcare and senior care, communication and housing infrastructure poland is the perfect place for piloting various solutions and programmes, as well as organisational models and forms of cooperation. increasing the number of such pilot projects and reinforcing the demand side for al-based solutions is one of the main of the al policy in this area. strategic partners for al and innovative companies: ) council of ministers committee for digital affairs; ) ministry of state assets; ) office of the minister in charge of digital affairs and computerisation; ) ministry of finance; ) ministry of funds and regional policy; ) ministry of climate and environment; ) ministry of national defence; ) ministry of agriculture and rural development; ) ministry of economic development; labour and technology; ) ministry of education and science; ) ministry of health; ) centre for ehealth; ) govtech polska programme team; ) sectoral organisations of entrepreneurs; ) statistics poland; ) ncbir national centre research and development; ) polish agency for enterprise development; ) polish investment and trade agency; ) future industry platform; ) polish development fund; ) social security administration (zus): short-term objectives (until ) 1_ increasing demand for al-based solutions. tools:  goals for

our vision: grow responsibly through knowledge romania to enhance romanian people's lives through al technology while becoming an active major contributor to the european and global al ecosystem: growth knowledge responsibility community



mission increase the quality of people's lives and obtain significant economic boost through the development and adoption of al technologies at a country level, while respecting and reflecting human ethical values, as emphasised in the eu guidelines for al adoption. at the same time, make romania an active partner and contributor at the european and global level; by developing original projects to benefit the local region;, europe and the entire world: to achieve the objectives set above, all the relevant sectors in romania private, public and academic must join efforts and create an optimal framework that ensures: the creation, attraction, and retention of al talent in romania; the development of innovative concepts, methods, and solutions through al research; the industrialization of al research ideas; the proactive and effective adoption of al solutions to generate growth and meet peoples needs; the efficient collection of data enabling the development of al solutions all these objectives must be followed through a human-centric approach to guarantee that the development and adoption of al has maximal positive impact on the future of work and wellbeing of the romanian people and that it will reflect human ethical values in line with the international community: create, attract, and retain al talent develop novel solutions through al research turn al research ideas into products services actions regulate to enable adoption of al-based solutions collect data and facilitate access to data  key



strategic directions . al talent: develop educational programs on al to create talent; prioritise funding for al projects (fundamental research, start-ups) that would attract and retain people with al skills;   support events and initiatives that strengthen and connect the local al communities . al research development: create frameworks to facilitate collaboration between academia and industry on al research projects; joint private and public funding for research in al; align the local research community to the international standards: . industrialization: create incubators start-up digital sandbox accelerators to support fast transition from research ideas to products . education in stem and future of work: conduct impact studies on the changes brought by al development and adoption on thejob market. adapt the education system and put a focus on stem disciplines to prepare the next generations for these potential changes inform and educate the population about the potential of ai. . data:  legal framework for data collection and sharing; facilitate the development of infrastructure for data collection and  sharing; ensure privacy; security of private information and protection against data misuse: . european and international cooperation: promotion and sync of romanian interests with eu priorities and global challenges. collaboration with claire and ellis organizations regulation: develop proper regulation that facilitates al adoption at national level, with a focus on boosting public procurement and public-private- academic partnerships, as well as on ensuring customer protection and cyber   security; democratization f access to al development and deployment capabilitiesl resourcesl services: . ethics: ensure ethical, security, and safety considerations are taken into account in the development and adoption of the al technology:



impacted domains . agriculture and environment agriculture is one of romania's main sectors of activity, with an agricultural capacity of . million hectares, and contributing about % of gdp approximately  million   people (almost % of romania's workforce) are employed in agriculture: however; the agricultural capacity is heavily underexploited (about . million hectares are not used) , due to obsolete technology, fragmentation and erosion of soil, desertification, and difficulty in accessing funds. using al-based systems within a properly regulated framework has a significant potential for agriculture, to counteract the aforementioned issues. examples of promising projects: weather forecasts autonomous machines (tractors, agribots, drones) enhanced analytics on collected data (soil sensors, connected livestock) precision agriculture wildlife and forest monitoring (including illegal activities) prediction andlor rapid response in case of events of environmental impact waste management monitoring smart automatic control of irrigation systems



impacted domains . healthcare health is the main factor influencing the wellbeing of the people, hence it represents a central priority for this strategy: the increase in the percentage of aging population and the decrease in density of medical doctors per capita, put healthcare at the top of priorities for romania. al technologies have a tremendous potential to improve access to healthcare services and the services themselves, through projects such as: enhance effectiveness of prevention programmes education and training of healthcare professionals support doctors in diagnosis and treatment monitoring of chronic diseases research facilitate access to diagnosis and treatment for rare diseases improve management of public healthcare system intelligent bots to assist medical personnel and patients for timely access to information medcn



impacted domains . education romania's future depends on the education   system available to young generations: the obsolete methods used in teaching combined with the poor training of teachers lead to concerning percentages of functional analphabetism in romania, especially in rural areas: al technologies have the potential to revolutionise the education system through projects such as: personalised content presentation, evaluation and feedback classes augmented with ar and vr technologies recommendations for further studying and curation of content enhanced blended learning through al gamification concepts implemented through al technology



impacted domains . infrastructure and smart city romania's infrastructure has been slowly  improving but is far behind other european countries: utilizing the existing infrastructure optimally while at the same time accelerating the process of improving the existing infrastructure is key for romania to be able to enhance its production and improve people's wellbeing: there is a huge potential to employ al technology for: autonomous driving for personal cars autonomous driving for transportation of goods scheduling and tracking of goods smart traffic lights timetable prediction for public transportation scheduling and automation of public transport smart sensors for irrigation in urban areas 



impacted domains . energy production and distribution romania has a balanced electricity mix, with coal, hydropower; natural gas, nuclear energy, and wind power having comparable shares of capacity and power generation however; almost all units are fairly old. improving maintenance of existing infrastructure is crucial. al could have a positive impact in the sector through projects such as: better estimates of available resources of petrol and gas to inform exploitation and storage decisions; predict machines and equipment load using smart sensors for better maintenance. , , , , , , biomass , , , solar , , wind , , nuclear , hydro ,  , gas and fuel oil ,  coal ,  coal hydro nuclear gas and fuel wind solar biomass oil     installed capacity; in mw anuual electricity production, in mwh

 introduction the definition of smart systems in the european commission's (ec) report ""science, research and innovation performance of the eu : a fair, green and digital europe [] states: artificial intelligence (ai) systems are software (and possibly also hardware) systems designed by humans that, given a complex goal, act in the physical or digital dimension by perceiving their environment through data acquisition, interpreting the collected structured or unstructured data, reasoning on the knowledge, or processing the information derived from this data and deciding the best action(s) to take to achieve the given goal. al systems can either use symbolic rules or learn a numeric model, and can also adapt their behaviour by analysing how the environment is affected by their previous actions. the term ai refers to both the thriving scientific discipline of ""artificial intelligence""  which emerged in , and the technological phenomenon of modern intelligent systems, which analyze their environment and with some independence take action to accomplish their tasks. for the practical purposes of this concept, al is a set of technologies that combine data, algorithms and computing power"" [], which has the potential to transform sectors of industry, services and society as a whole. the  growing  capacity of computing  infrastructure and the emergence of very large volumes of data are a major reason for recognizing that europe's sustainable economic growth and prosperity will increasingly rely on the deployment of smart systems and the economic benefits of data processing. however, the use of ai technologies poses number of potential risks, such as non-transparency of the decision-making process, violation of privacy, criminal use or simply   rejection and rejection by citizens due to the   requirements for   higher qualifications or fear of change in the labor market: in the context of global competition for a leading role in the development and implementation of ai, the ec is committed [] to helping to achieve scientific breakthroughs, to maintaining the technological leadership ofthe european union (eu) and to ensuring that new technologies will be at the service of all europeans in order to improve their lives while respecting their rights. the commission also calls on the member states to contribute to building a european ""ecosystem"" for the development and use of ai in full respect of citizens' values and rights. at european level, ai is a component ofthe digital europe programme [], which aims to bring about a digital  transformation in the eu in the period -, with maximum benefits for businesses, public administrations and society. the policies of the digital europe programme focus on five main areas: high-performance  computing (hpc); artificial intelligence (ai); cybersecurity and trust; advanced digital  skills;   interoperability and digital transformation. al is a basic digital technology that must become widely available and used by business, the public sector and all european citizens. ai will also significantly support the development of automation and data exchange in production technologies, which will achieve a digital transformation in industry (the so-called note: the designations [], [], [], in the text are references t0 the number of documents in part , where a bibliography of the sources used is given_ key



introduction industry . []). autonomous cyberphysical systems and the functioning of the internet of things in real time will be the basis for the emergence of virtual productions and smart factories. the ec is already addressing issues related to safety and responsibilities in the implementation of robotics and autonomous systems with ai []. the european approach to the development and use of al is characterized by a unique vision technological progress to be accompanied by a legal and ethical framework to ensure the security and rights of citizens, as well as measures to collect accessible data of high quality, wide dissemination of information, and equal access to the benefits of al technology: europe aims to become a world leader in trust - worthy ai"" in which ai applications follow certain ethical standards and do not cause intentional or accidental harm even when are handled by   people with minimal technical   knowledge. this would increase  public confidence in european ai, developed in a unique trust ecosystem and motivate industry to offer products and services where reliability is a competitive advantage. ethical norms will be an incentive for new research, scientific breakthroughs and innovation in ai. in this way, the eu will set global standards for ai. the high-level expert group on artificial intelligence (ai hleg)? in  identified ethical principles and related values that should be respected in the development, implementation and use of al systems: the principle of respecting human autonomy, the principle of prevention of harm, the principle of fairness and the principle of explainability [] . in ,the ec published seven requirements [] that al applications must meet to be considered reliable: human agency and oversight ai systems should not impair human autonomy and cause other adverse effects; technical robustness and safety the physical and mental safety of al systems to be verified at all stages by all parties concerned; privacy and data governance the data is free from inaccuracies or errors and does not reflect social prejudices; explainability and transparency to record and document both the decisions taken by the ai systems and the whole process that led to these decisions; diver non-discrimination and fairness to ensure universal design for access for people with disabilities; societal and environmental well-being to monitor the social impact of ai, as well as the sustainability and environmental responsibility of al systems; accountability to ensure responsibility and  accountability for ai systems   and their outcomes, to minimize potential negative impacts. regarding the technical stability and security of ai systems, a number of recommendations and  specific  requirements have been set for new types   of risks and vulnerabilities:   possible covert attacks   through data manipulation and   decision-making mechanisms, as well as abuses ofthe ""black box effect due to the use of machine learning and data_ the   essential  difference  between ai systems and ""traditional' information and  europa eu/digital-single-marketlen/high-level-expert-group-artificial-intelligence they key sity, equal big



introduction management systems is that in ai it is not always possible to why a model has led to a specific result o solution, and what combination of input factors has contributed to this. in these cases_ the algorithms are likened to a ""black box' and the principle of ""explainability"" is proposed, which is directly  related to the 'transparency""  requirement and is  essential  for building and maintaining citizens' trust in ai applications. processes must be transparent, the capabilities and purpose of ai systems must be openly communicated, and decisions must be explained, to the extent possible, to those directly or  indirectly affected by them: other explanatory measures are also proposed (traceability, auditability and transparent communication about the capabilities ofthe system). the approach in the ""self-assessment list"" of ai systems published by the ec according to the seven key requirements is also based on risk assessment depending on the degree of criticality in using al systems and the solutions they offer , the dependence on their correctness and possible harmful consequences. the latest version from july  of the assessment list for trustworthy artificial intelligence (altai) [], developed by the high-level expert group on ai, also offers an online self-assessment platform to raise awareness and knowledge of implementing organizations and companies (especially small and medium-sized businesses, on the risks and methods of prevention: regarding the need to develop and implement ai-specific standards , the ec has published rolling plan for ict standardization [], which includes an al section with five specific measures to coordinate actions between member state and  eu institutions on policies, requirements and  investments, as well as coordination with   international standardization organizations and world practices. a section is devoted to the specific aspects of ai cybersecurity, identification of gaps and necessary standards regarding security, safety and protection of personal information in ai systems, the possibilities of ai for cyber protection,as well as the specifics ofprotection against malicious use of ai. from the beginning of , special groups have been set up in european standardization organizations for example, the etsi securing artificial   intelligence group   (european telecommunications standards institute). an expert group on artificial intelligence cybersecurity has been set up at the european union agency for cyber security (enisa). data is an important raw material for ai and a prerequisite (along with computing infrastructure) for the development of new algorithms and applications the eu has strict rules on the use of personal data (gdpr) [], which make it difficult to access information for citizens, for example in healthcare. in order to facilitate the collection of large volumes of anonymised   personal, non-personal and public  data   and to make   them accessible to all interested parties [] [], the ec plans to create european data spaces [] as an initiative shared with member states. this is an extremely challenging task due to the need to standardize formats and ensure interoperability, especially given that some of the data is in free text in different languages. in   order to facilitate the   widespread   dissemination of ai and equal access to new technologies for citizens and small and medium enterprises, the ec will establish world-class ai reference testing and experimentation facilities in several areas: hardware, software_ components, systems, data, computing infrastructures and cloud  computing []. these facilities will provide a highly specialized network of shared resources at european level and explain special using key



introduction will support the implementation of al in healthcare , smart agriculture, robotics, manufacturing, smart cities and more with developing an ethical and legal standard for ai, the eu will build a high- performance ecosystem throughout the value chain, starting with scientific research and innovation. the activities of related scientific research centers of excellence will be supported and coordinated and it will be ensured that at least one digital innovation hub specialized in the field of ai is set up in each member state. however, europe's ambitious agenda must be realized over the next decade in competition with superior us and chinese investment plans [] and in an aggressive battle for markets with the products of technology giants such as google , amazon, microsoft and others which currently dominate the development of most leading ai technologies []. achieving a scale requires pan-european approach to al that will prevent the fragmentation of the european research area and the single market. member states are invited to draw up national ai strategies or programs, or to integrate this dimension into other related strategies and programs ,   outlining the envisaged investments and implementation measures []. the current draft concept for the development of al in bulgaria (ai-bg) for the period - follows the guidelines outlined by the high-level expert group on ai in the document policy and investment recommendations for trustworthy ai"" []. the main areas of impact are building al infrastructure, developing scientific research capacity and adequate digital skills, supporting innovation, developing a legal framework , increasing   public confidence, and   focusing   specifically on   selected   priority areas for   individual  countries. examples of priority areas are often cited as health, agriculture, administration and transport. the ec documents do not discuss the use of al for military purposes for example, the development of autonomous weapons_ which does not preclude the development of such scientific research and applications at the national level . the areas of impact, priorities and activities proposed in the concept take into account the bulgarian  strategic and normative documents created so far , which address the digital transformation of the economic and public sectors, upgrading them with specific measures for the development of ai in our country. along public



 . ai as a driver of digital transformation for economic growth and quality of life the entry of ai is radically changing a number of sectors of the economy and society as a whole. although the ideas and some fundamental techniques of ai originated long ago, today,as a result of the accumulated computing capacity, communication potential and data,the world is facing transformations that are much more far-reaching than the technological revolution of the last century. changes do not happen at the same pace in different sectors due to different degrees of readiness of ai technologies for implementation, insufficient readiness of the sector to accept them, especially if solid financial investments are required, unclear regulatory   framework, lack of staff , lack of consensus in the   professional   community, consumers or society as a whole and others. the countries with high-tech economies and a high level of computer skills of citizens are most dynamically implementing intelligent systems. however , news shows that ai as a key tool for development is also entering bulgaria, often as an imported product with limited use and, albeit more slowly, becoming a catalyst for digital transformation. research logistics manufacturing ict/software digital platforms robotics e-commerce agriculture autonomous ai systems healthcare developers ai public administ - consumers ration ai smart cities education enablers transport energy finance ecology and the legal environment framework crisis response security rapid big daily



.al as a driver of digital transformation for economic growth and quality of life sectors and their connection with the creation and use of ai regarding the creation and use of ai in different industries, three groups of sectors stand out: artificial intelligence developing sectors; artificial intelligence consuming sectors; enabling the development and implementation of artifiicla intelligence; .. artificial intelligence developing sectors -research excellence in fundamental and applied research in ai,ict,robotics, autonomous systems and other related fields, which create and test reliable ai technologies, is one ofthe main factors for europe's intellectual and commercial leadership. currently, european scientists publish most articles with scientific and applied results in the field of ai (over % of the global scientific production in scopus for  []) , but work mainly in relatively small and fragmented scientific units, which calls for the unification ofthe european research community through enhanced international cooperation and targeted funding, talent retention mechanisms in europe and the implementation of sustainable technology transfer schemes to industry through public-private partnerships. research fields in which the largest increase in the number of published articles is observed are: machine  learning, including learning; natural   language and   speech processing; machine vision; al in cyberphysical systems and robotics (us $ . billion was invested in self-driving vehicle research in the world in  []); cognitive systems. other research areas of strategic importance are: development of ai-algorithms for chips embedded in internet of things devices; creating a hybrid al with capacity for inference and learning as the core of systems capable of explaining; development of algorithms for learning facts from small data sets, etc. the capacity of ai systems to draw inferences over big data is expected to increase significantly in the coming decades []. the improvement of al presupposes the development of the basics of ict and will lead to the emergence of a new generation of technologies. ai is already beginning to be  used for software development, which allows automatic synthesis of program code. the european high-level expert group recommends the establishment of a strategic roadmap for al research in the eu, outlining the specialized and interdisciplinary scientific problems and major research challenges. the  map should be regularly and research in the eu to achieve reliable ai, helping to harmonize   member states' research programs []. .. artifical intelligence consuming sectors practically every sector using digitization is a potential consumer of a type of ai, because the   implemented   computer   systems can incorporate   intelligent services or devices for automation of routine repetitive activities. this  also   applies to large and medium-sized industrial organizations, which typically generate big data. smes are also potential users of ai,  they deep updated guide



.al as a driver of digital transformation for economic growth and quality of life which helps analyze customer data and offers ways to personalize services and products a survey on the perception of ai in companies [], conducted in december   with representatives of  industries shows that % of respondents with the largest share of the software industry, followed by finance and banking, are interested in ai. al is mainly used for analysis or is integrated into the production process the biggest obstacle to the implementation of ai is the lack of support from the organization. here are examples of the various ways in which al is transforming industry, services and society today and the expected changes in the near future. e-commerce: this seems to be the sector with the most widespread use of ai at the moment. global e-commerce   platforms track customer   choices, accumulate  profile data for each individual customer, and offer a personalized selection of preferred products. geo-targeted promotions with language localization and automatic price optimization allow worldwide sales. automatic dialog assistants with the ability to recognize natural language speech with accuracy, also called chatbots, provide interaction and communication with customers without the participation of human staff, answer basic questions and help to make round-the-clock sales. large e-commerce platforms such as amazon make extensive use of strategies to personalize and model customer expectations, increasing their revenue at an impressive rate. modern  platforms (on the internet): technology giants such as google, microsoft and lenovo use ai to facilitate communication with their customers. some of their products are difficult for the average non-specialist user to understand, and therefore specialized virtual assistants are created using speech recognition and natural language comprehension in certain narrower areas _ smart voice assistants   analyze user replicas in real time and   generate appropriate responses. machine translation on the  internet  is revolution   in the field of communications and its quality is constantly improving. world leaders in social networks such as facebook use ai components to recognize images (faces, objects) and filter fake news. technology giants a competitive advantage by acquiring smaller companies, innovators in certain niches of ai, and thus consolidate their dominant position. finance and banking: lending and investment management also use ai systems to assess customer solvency. virtual assistants specializing in banking and financial services can use ai to mimic human   logical   reasoning skills and  provide   personalized advice. as online transactions become more popular every year, the financial and banking industries are facing more   and more complex cases of identity theft ad fraud losses. ai will help build next- generation financial cybersecurity through systems that use deep real-time self-learning and analysis that detect patterns of behavior and detect suspicious deviations and potential fraud. energy: al will provide new solutions to improve energy efficiency through the collection and processing of volumes of data and machine learning, as well as through robotic energy inspection systems. the analysis of data on energy consumption by individual consumers will allow optimization to be carried out in order to achieve more efficient consumption and reduce energy consumption and monitoring the operation of power facilities through sensors and drones in real time will allow for assessment of their condition, reporting of local meteorological changes and the impact of other environmental factors, as well as data collection as a basis for optimization and planning. energy production, and others.  good many gain large grid paid. grid price



.al as a driver of digital transformation for economic growth and quality of life production: ai helps manufacturers reduce costs while maintaining high quality products and services . this is achieved by optimizing   operations:   improving  efficiency by planning maintenance, reducing downtime or supply chain   optimization.  today, ai is built into automated machines that perform uniform repetitive activities. in the coming years, however, a transition from ""assistive   intelligence"" to ""autonomous   intelligent factories"" based on internet-connected devices is expected. data collected from connected devices in production lines will be integrated with data from design, engineering and quality control teams, creating an intelligent work environment for training smart machines"" that simulate intelligent behavior with little or no human intervention. manufacturing companies will maintain and increase their competitiveness if their production is managed by ai systems. logistics: the exchange of goods and cargo is a global activity that can be optimized through ai and machine learning: coordinating the exchange of billions of individual products and goods on the world transport network is a task that already goes beyond human management capabilities. al applications in logistics match supply and demand, and also help to coordinate and plan production, warehousing, transport networks and vehicles and supplies. thus, with the use of ai,distribution can reach optimal levels of efficiency, while reducing the cost of logistics activities in general: healthcare: ai can provide a radical improvement in the analysis of complex medical images such as x-rays, computer tomography examinations, and various screenings and tests. data from clinical trials in patient records and external sources of knowledge, such as  medical ontologies, genetic databases, conceptual resources including open related data, etc = will allow the detection of unknown patterns and correlations in the onset and course of disease, early diagnosis , finding a better treatment for chronic diseases and building a personalized treatment plan for each patient. applications of al in biotechnology help to shorten the process ofcreating new drugs. last but not least,the success of the automatic analysis of free text allows to quickly find relevant facts in the scientific literature almost everywhere, software platforms are being set up to automatically provide medical advice to patients in real time, including immediate advice when symptoms occur (which is an example of an ethical and legal issue related to the protection of personal data and liability). agriculture: in this area_ ai provides   approaches to   managing  expert   information and knowledge about nature, natural processes and modern agricultural technologies to find smart solutions for efficient land use as a source of health, food and income. in animal husbandry, ai provides tools to automate animal monitoring and robotize technological operations, including intelligent waste management: ai will be key in addressing important issues related to crop protection and forestry, veterinary pharmacy and medicine , agroecology and toxicology, plant and animal genetics and selection. elements of al are used in data management for climatic, meteorological and soil   conditions, for in-depth analysis of   statistical information on agricultural   production, for processing images from drones and real-time means of communication, in the construction of digital duplicates, to support automation of processes and reduction of human labor. ai will significantly contribute to the development of modern, efficient, knowledge-based  agriculture, which will increase the quality of food and protect natural resources_ 



.al as a driver of digital transformation for economic growth and quality of life public administration: most  national ai strategies in the eu include modernizing administration as a priority []. in the context of emerging digitalization and the accumulation of increasing data on citizens and public life, management practices are expected to be based on modern   approaches to data   processing and thus   increase the   capacity to offer better administrative services. various al technologies have already been implemented in european public organizations: image recognition, which allows automatic identification of faces and objects in photos or video;  interactive   communication and  reference   systems   with voice connection, which are able to perform automatic analysis and generation of text and speech; profiling, which facilitates the grouping of citizens with similar needs and the creation of personalized public services; automation of repetitive administrative tasks in order to alleviate the  workload of civil servants. the ec has published a report on the use of ai in public organizations in the member states [] and plans to develop a methodological framework for assessing the benefits of ai implementation, as well as a roadmap for the implementation of ai technologies at different levels of government. transport: ai is also changing the transport sector []. in road transport, revolutionary changes are associated with the emergence of autonomous vehicles: automated vehicles (including parcel delivery) are already being tested in a limited number of situations and driving areas. ai technology monitors traffic at real-time traffic lights and sends traffic warnings and information to drivers about the fastest alternative route. in air transport, ai will improve the training of airplane autopilots, the management of increasingly active air traffic and airspace planning, airport passenger flow management systems, and security clearance systems. projects are funded  for prototypes of smart trains, which, unlike the metro_ run in an open environment and can encounter unpredictable obstacles. in shipping and waterborne transport, except for autonomous vessel prototypes, ai is used in accident management systems, ensuring safety and minimizing environmental risks in shipping: the optimization of transport routes and the efficiency of transport nodes is another area for application of ai. smart cities: ai is the foundation of smart city decision-making technologies. objects in the city are connected to sensors that communicate with each other on the internet of things, this generates a considerable amount of data and through them al understands and optimizes the physical world to make the city a better place to live. one of the first features is the analysis of traffic data monitored by connected internet cameras in order to help cities reduce congestion and air pollution. over time, ai learns and decisions become better. the emergence of 5g networks will allow real-time monitoring and optimization of the efficiency of energy systems, utilities, water supply networks, waste collection, real estate management and urban planning, as well as coordination between libraries, schools, hospitals and other public services with purpose of sharing resources. some ofthe listed functionalities have already been implemented in large cities around the world (a significant part of them are in the eu) ecology and the en vironment: significant advances in  image   recognition   will help to automatically collect and analyze data related to observations of biodiversity, depletion of natural resources, pollution and changes in the environment. better, data-based models of the observed processes will be   created, which will allow studying the trends and  predicting important factors such as water availability, pollution, ecosystem conservation, etc. in the next decade, more sophisticated ai systems will appear for integrated processing of unstructured  public fully being

[ ]. in this way, the ec calls for implementation in the public sphere of projects for which the   technology is   already well   developed and allows  large-scale implementation: .. sectors enabling the development and implementation of ai there are two main sectors enablers, those that create conditions for the development of ai education and training at all levels ofthe education system, including vocational retraining through lifelong learning, and the existence of an adequate legislative framework: higher education creates specialized   specialists   in the   field, while in secondary education basic computer literacy and basic knowledge of ict are built, in particular the use of ai systems. the   role of research and  education, as well as lifelong learning, is   fundamental to the development of ai and its implementation in practice in all other sectors. legislative activity is a mandatory step in the process of building a reliable ad focused on human ai and its acceptance by society: education and lifelong learning key role for the development and implementation of al is the availability of human potential: specialists who are familiar with the latest discoveries and trends in the field, to master methods and tools for scientific research, implementation in practice and teaching, o to be able explain the benefits of adopting intelligent systems for widespread use. to create a critical mass   of specialists   with higher  education, the most   developed european countries are planning   solid investments in  university structures and doctoral programs in ai. a number  of national ai strategies propose the creation of educational platforms for free distance learning courses in this discipline. finland has already created public course slides on basic ai concepts? which it will provide in all official languages in the eu, and plans to upgrade and develop a series of courses. last but not least, integration with research and business plays a key role in achieving high quality al education. to this end, almost all national european strategies propose the creation of this type of cooperation. the introduction of ai in school education programs will have a profound effect o the skills required by . the acquisition of these skills should lead to faster and easier adaptation of students to the work environment after graduation, while on the other hand it prepares them for the professions of the future. the programs for high-tech vocational high schools should be prepared  and constantly adapted with the help of the   higher schools   and the research organizations, as well as in close connection with the leading bulgarian companies in the field of ai. the integration the axis school-university-business' is key both for the quality and current curricula in the field of ai, and for the critical deficits of teachers and  elementsofai.com/  rapid along filling

 . proposal for development of an action plan and selection of priority sectors given bulgaria's limited resources, it is important to set national priorities for the thematic areas of ai  implementation. chapter 7_ which outlines a framework   for  implementation; coordination and funding, proposes to organize a working group, including representatives of all stakeholders, to map the status of sectors important for the development and implementation of ai (regulations, industry . assessment of the national and regional innovation capacity in ict, etc ) and to develop an action plan in the short, medium and long term until . a fundamental proposal is for bulgaria to focus on technological specialization in the field of data economy, as the country would find it  difficult to achieve  strong industrial specialization due to the lack ofa critical mass of leading industrial companies in the al sector. the trend is for data to come to the forefront in al and for the focus in machine self- learning to shift from algorithms to data []. such is the european policy to make the eu world leader in data-driven economics []. an example of a useful service that would be very valuable for ai applications is the integration of private (company) data with publicly available ontologies and very large databases to prepare a data resource for further analysis. it is possible to list branches and thematic areas in which it is important to conduct scientific and applied research and to create both innovative prototypes and real, implemented in practice applications_ software industry. the information technology industry (in which  software  development plays central  role) is sustainable   development and of ever-increasing  importance   for bulgaria both in purely economic aspects as a growing contribution to the country's gross domestic product, with the highest staff pay in the industry,as well as in social and other aspects retention o return from abroad of highly intelligent ad qualified personnel, crucial for the inclusion of broad goups of the population in high-tech tools in everyday life, etc. at the global level, bulgaria is increasingly establishing itself as a destination for the development ofresearch and  development  activities, as well as   intensive innovative technologies in software. the software-al relationship should be developed in two aspects: application of ai methods in software development: in this aspect the prospects are very good, considering that o the one hand, bulgarian researchers have documented and recognized achievements at   the world   level29 , and on the other in  general the qualification of bulgarian software developers is high and they are open to the adoption  example, m. vechev and v_ raichev, founders of the software company deepcode, a spin-off of the zurich polytechnic, purchased in  by the unicorn company snyk. the main product of deepcode performs  semantic analysis of real-time programme code based on al and has over , users   today, for



6_proposal for development of an action and selection of priority sectors and application of new methodologies and tools for ai-based software  development (including so-called software .); software  development   with built-in ai such as: tools systems environments for intelligent software development and management systems; building systems and means for cyber protection with al; al systems for analysis and prevention of hybrid attacks (including   misinformation,  manipulation, fake news , etc.); ai systems for critical infrastructure protection; systems for processing and communication in natural language with inclusion of the bulgarian language; real-time  image recognition and analysis systems software for large   volumes; means   for training and protection against ai manipulations (including data protection and reliability); autonomous intelligent systems (robots, etc ) and cyberphysical systems . the software, which is developed this way, in addition to being the subject of intensive exports (which is also typical for the software currently produced in bulgaria) , will significantly help the implementation of ai in the consumer sectors. creating al applications for educational purposes. this area is important due to the rapid entry of e-learning in our country: it is no longer just about e-learning materials and online communication environments to accompany the main activities in the classroom3o but about entirely distance teaching and assessment. al tools can be used to improve a number of aspects of distance learning and to benefit from the information gathered, as as they are carefully designed and trained on representative data. al applications will allow: creation of learning materials with virtual reality, voice connection and attractive game elements; personalization of teaching with the help of intelligent training systems and adaptive navigation in the metadata of learning resources; diagnosing the attention, reactions, emotions and dynamics of the work of individual learners as feedback in personalized learning; supporting student assessment; supporting the generation of assessment tests by automatically synthesizing questions, answers and distractors according to a given textbook; analysis ofthe collected data on the success and opinions of students, parents and teachers to assess the quality of the learning process; creating software to support the planning of teachers' work; the integration of language technologies into systems   for supporting the learning of foreign languages. in practice , any formalized set of grammar rules can be considered as a resource for automatic testing of knowledge of the relevant aspects of the language, which is built  into   specially  designed tests   for  verification. it  would be useful for bulgarians abroad to provide a online interface for learning bulgarian grammar .  the so-called  blended learning'  plan long public



.proposal for_development ofan action plan and selection of priority sectors ai applications in public services. the report ""overview ofthe use and effect of al in public services in the european union' [] , published in july  , analyzes  deployments of ai services in the eu public sector for the period may  february . the most common services as a percentage of the applications considered are: chatbots, intelligent digital assistants, virtual assistants, advisory systems .; predictive analytics, simulations, data visualization %; computer vision (automatic image processing) and identity recognition .; expert systems, rule-based systems, algorithmic decision making .%; natural language processing, text mining , speech recognition and analysis % . other applications are: (deep) machine learning, process and vehicle automation, al- based knowledge management, security analytics, audio processing. bulgaria is among the countries with relatively lower growth in the   implementation of ai applications () , the netherlands is leading with  systems, but nine countries are at the level of bulgaria or with a lower number of considered applications. the use of al technologies in public services in our country can be expanded and deepened, because the country has qualified specialists and experience in all of the above ai technologies. intelligent agriculture. bulgaria already has the necessary conditions for the development and implementation of relatively large-scale applications of al in plant and animal husbandry - high degree of connectivity, cloud structures for data exchange and storage, accessible public data, qualified developers and specialists for the maintenance of complex cyberphysical systems. embedding al technologies will allow the creation of complex infrastructures that integrate the virtual and physical world and provide support for agricultural activities, such as remote process control; effective use and monitoring of the quality of water resources and soil; monitoring and controlling the growth of agricultural crops to increase  yield   and improve the taste of agricultural products; analysis of sensory data and publicly available satellite images and application of digital methods for diagnostics, forecasting and management of the production of quality products without negative effects on the climate   and the environment. the introduction of modern technologies, such as the use of automation and robots in various plant and animal husbandry processes, will be an important practical evidence of the benefits of automating  unattractive activities. different ai technologies are integrated into intelligent agriculture   systems: machine learning   including   deep  learning;   semantic   modeling   and ontological engineering; intelligent autonomous agents and multi-agent systems; accompanying technologies such as the internet of and cloud structures; construction and maintenance of 3d models; analysis, integration and aggregation of big data for forecasting and operational decision making. several prototype developments in this area after an in-depth assessment could serve as a reference infrastructure to be adapted and further developed for different regions of bulgaria at the service of agricultural producers. this will support the formation and implementation of a consolidated agricultural policy, taking advantage of the application of ai in agriculture, and will facilitate the entry of digitalization and industry . in  things

proposal for_development ofan action plan and selection ofpriority sectors national, european and international health information standards, national and cross-border data exchange, to ensure the necessary high level of security of health data and leads to the lack of objective criteria for assessing the quality of health services and the effectiveness of the significant   financial resources   invested in the   system: the   general  opinion is systemic dissatisfaction of the citizens and the medical staff with the existing health care system and lack of trust in its quality and efficiency. thus, medical  informatics, which is a highly valued profession in western europe, is becoming a misunderstood and therefore unattractive field of specialization for young bulgarian computer scientists. there is a lack of competent specialists in this highly interdisciplinary field due to the insufficient representation of medical and health informatics in theprogrammes of medical universities. the strategic documents  for the development of bulgaria in the next decade plan the creation of a national health information system, including a national system for electronic health records of citizens, electronic referrals  and electronic   prescriptions. this   will be a prerequisite for the integration of health information and on this basis t0 overcome the existing fragmentation between them by achieving semantic interoperability of systems and technologies in health care and ensuring national and cross-border exchange of health data: the integration of elements of e-health systems in the e-government portal will allow citizens easy access to data related to the health system: it is proposed to create and maintain a national access point, providing national and cross-border secure exchange of electronic health records with medical and health data from treatments, therapies, research, including medical images) and electronic prescriptions. with the planned development of e-health in bulgaria, it will be possible to apply the tools of ai for the analysis of patterns and predictive analytics for disease detection and risk factors over the gathered large collections of pseudonymous data for bulgarian patients. if a risk of an observed or future disease is identified, it will be possible to send messages to at-risk patients and their doctors for prophylaxis within an integrated health information system. in this way, new models in health care and prevention of various diseases will be studied, based on the analysis of big data with the means of ai. based on the data collected, it will be possible to set up decision support systems, including by improving the reading of medical images, in clinical practice and healthcare management. the detailed automatic analysis of anonymized records of bulgarian patients will also help to create expertise that will be used in building a space for bulgarian data in the field of healthcare as part of the european data space . another task is related to the semi-automatic creation of arrays of formalized knowledge with labels in bulgarian, by using ai for machine translation of resources in english. in medicine, there is a solid resource of manually defined declarative conceptual knowledge, with names of concepts and connections in english this is the unified medical language system (umlsj!) , which is freely available for research. one of its purposes is to support the creation of systems that automatically ""understand' biomedical texts. there are also a large number of  unified medical language system see  nih:gov/research/umls/index html, built since  by the us national library of medicine.  systems partial

 _ implementation, monitoring and financial provision .. implementation in connection with the effective implementation, monitoring and financial provision of the activities envisaged in the concept, it is appropriate for the council of ministers to establish an interdepartmental working   group, which will include   representatives of state institutions, district   administrations, academia, business and professional associations and related ngos. this working group should analyze the state of the sector , map the expert units, achievements and  implemented innovations, and prepare an operational  national plan roadmap for the   implementation of the concept, which defines the   specific measures deadlines, responsible   institutions and  organizations,  expected  results and indicators and sources of the necessary financial resources, as well as organization for reporting on their implementation and their periodic updating: given the horizontal nature of the topic, the implementation of the national plan roadmap will be   shared with the leading state   institutions the ministry of transport, information   technology and communications (mtitc), the   ministry of education  and science (moes) , the state agency for research and innovation (sari) , ministry of economy (moe) , state e-government agency (sega), ministry of labor and social policy (mlsp), ministry of health  (mh), bulgarian small  and medium  enterprises promotion agency (bsmepa), ministry of agriculture, food and forestry (maff) , ministry of environment and water (moew) , ministry of energy (me), ministry of justice (moj) , ministry of finance (mof), ministry of interior (mi), and the ministry of defence (mod). other ministries and agencies   should be involved in the inclusion of other specific areas of application in the roadmap. the regional authorities  should prepare their own plans   with measures   for the implementation of ai-bg and establish their own regional units to support the dissemination of information on the results and opportunities for implementation. in addition to participants from state institutions, the working group should include representatives of universities and research organizations, business and industry organizations and clusters, sofia tech park, as well as national  non-profit   associations   related to   science and  technology (federation of scientific technical unions in bulgaria, the union of scientists in bulgaria, the union of automation and informatics , the union of electronics, electrical engineering and telecommunications) , and non-governmental organizations such as the american chamber of commerce , the law and internet foundation and others . .. monitoring in organizational terms, it is most appropriate for the monitoring of the implementation of al-related activities in the relevant sectoral and regional policies to be carried out by coordinating body council appointed by the council of ministers. the council should involve   representatives of all stakeholders and establish a model and mechanism for coordination at the   strategic , political, operational  and  technical levels, ensuring that the  key



implementation, monitoring and financial provision priorities and objectives of ai-bg are updated and linked to the development and implementation of national sectoral strategies. it is   desirable to use the experience of eu partners to manage strategic interdisciplinaryprogrammes and to involve international experts in the council. much of the information needed for the work of the council will be provided by the contractors under the usual measures of the monitoring structure to ensure the accuracy and correctness of this information _ using an electronic platform for information sharing. the evaluation of the implementation will be carried out periodically and will be presented in reports, which will be submitted for approval by the council of ministers. the purpose of the monitor) of the implementation of ai-bg is the possibility for continuous and accurate reflection of the current results of its implementation and, as direct consequence of this to take, if necessary, appropriate corrective actions. at the end of the planned  period   for   implementation of the concept, a full, objective  and  comprehensive evaluation of the final results will be performed . the main parameters subject to monitoring are: compliance with the budget; compliance with deadlines; the achievement of the planned results and their quality . while   objective   tracking of the first two parameters does not cause fundamental difficulties, this is not the case for the third parameter. the implementation of any planned measures 0r solutions must be accompanied by a measurement of their effectiveness, as well as by criteria that should determine the level of success of any such measure or decision. to avoid subjectivity as much as possible, all measurements should, as a general rule, be quantitative and exceptions should be made where it is in principle impossible to define them. they must be carried out before the start of each activity to fix its initial state, during its implementation and after its completion. however, this means that the relevant measures must be defined, verified and validated in advance. to the parameters formulated in this way should be added some additional ones related to: the effective use of the   provided resources personnel, technologies, materials , information, etc;; compliance with various requirements regulatory, ethical, motivational, etc. some of the criteria for the evaluation of the activities provided in ai-bg are already introduced or standard, such as indicators for the success of research and those related to the evaluation of the efficiency of resource use_ at the same time, there are criteria and indicators that need to be specified, such as assessing the impact of the emerging data economy, timely reporting of changes in the labor market,measuring public awareness and attitudes towards the perception of ai others . new indicators are currently being developed within the composite index for the entry of digital economy and society index (desi), which measures the development of eu member states in terms of digitalisation in various fields, 5g coverage and use, artificial intelligence, ict for  ing and

foreword by xavier bettel. igital xembour pvative initiatives a powerful technology, bursting with opportunity: artificial intelligence is ready to be harnessed. what this means exactly is up to us. the digital movement has brought with it unprecedented amounts of data, but it is only valuable if we can extract value from it: in a data-driven society, al is the channel through which we can translate unfathomable amounts of data into instant; actionable answers. in other words, al makes it possible forhumanity to tap into a global, collective intelligence for the first time ever: by automating cumbersome processes, unlocking a new level of personalized services and laying the foundation for a smart world, al holds the power to transform human life like few technologies before it: perhaps even more important than the discoveries we make is what we decide to do with our new tools and knowledge. due to als massive implications, each step forward that our country takes will be coordinated, collaborative and informed by diverse perspectives. luxembourgs vision is one in which al weaves smoothly into the fabric of society improving the lives ofall citizens and strengthening our activities as a nation and member of the global community: p. 



this strategic vision for al in luxembourgarticulates our activities, ambitions and intentions related to the role of al,both here and across the eu. for luxembourg, committing to al goes beyond supporting applied research and development projects. it means knowing where we can make a difference, on a global scale. and it asks us to take a hard look at the role we want al to fill within our society. as a diverse; innovative nation, we will decide what impact this technology will have on human rights, on peoples lives and on our democratic values. thats al: a powerful technology fully in our control and bursting with opportunity: xavier bettel prime minister minister for digitalization p.  good



a strategic vision for ai in luxembourg: establishing a strategic vision for al in luxembourg has become a national priority: the time has come to analyze recent developments, acknowledge the speed at which al technologies deliver new services, and actively shape al in the country the prime minister and minister of digitalization, xavier bettel, has launched an inter-ministerial consultation process to define a strategic vision for al in luxembourg; the result of which is presented in this document: this vision is not intended as a one-off 'strategy, but rather the first edition ofa policy vision, to be updated on a regular basis and further defined where needed: this policy vision is built on luxembourgs ambitions as a digital front-runner: ambition #i: to be among the most advanced digital societies in the world, especially in the eu ambition #: to become a data-driven and sustainable economy ambition #: to support human-centric ai development it is possible that the countrys opportunities to develop ground-breaking fundamental al research are limited. other than the financial services sector; we lack the critical mass of other countries to harvest the opportunities of large-scale datasets. this vision does not pretend otherwise. however; luxembourg is extremely strong in focused and applied al research and can certainly contribute to the development of services that will help us overcome big challenges luxembourg has the funding, the ecosystem and the infrastructure to develop this strength in the short and term: every luxembourgs researchers develop unique and cutting-edge technology: in esch-belval, al tools are helping them sift through the medical data of parkinson's patients the answers may already exist, but only al can find the needle in the large haystack of medical data and thanks to ai- powered computing, researchers are designing and testing a new paradigm in luxembourgs mobility: autonomous cars, which achieve levels of safety out of reach for humans this is luxembourgs unique advantage: because of its strategic focus on applied al, luxembourgis already today a living al lab with global influence: al is fueled by very data sets. in most areas, as mentioned, luxembourg will not have the critical mass to generate these data sets on its own but in order to assure that those data sets can reach their full economic and social potential, while safeguarding fundamental ethical and privacy principles, a number ofregulatory questions regarding the use ofthese data sets have to be answered. p.  long day, large



therefore, luxembourg will develop research and innovation activities focused on regulatory frameworks concerning the use of data for al: the will be to an attractive and agile environment for data-driven and data-intensive services and activities in the field of al. luxembourg is not only located between france and germany, but it is also in close proximity to some of their most advanced al research centers: nancy, strasbourg, saarbricken, kaiserslautern and freiburg; to name but a few: responding to those countries' respective al strategies, luxembourg could become part of a cutting-edge, cross-border hub for applied al research of the highest level of excellence: this strategic al vision is based on an already strong financial commitment: the ministry of the economy has allocated approximately €62m in  for al-related projects through randd grants, while granting a total ofapproximately €z7m in  for projects based on this type of technology: the luxembourg national research fund (fnr), for example, has increasingly invested in research projects that cover big data and al-related topics in fields ranging from parkinsons disease to autonomous and intelligent systems approximately €zoom over the past five years. at the request of the government; the fnr is currently revising the national research priorities for luxembourg: the data-driven economy and al-induced innovations in health; mobility and regulation will be part of the updated research priorities p.  goal shape



human-centric focus human intelligence in control of al. al comes mainly in the form of companion technologies, which are already augmenting the diagnostic capacities of our medical staff, handling dangerous and time-consuming industrial labor; and taking care of repetitive tasks so that employees do not have to fill out endless forms, for example. the technology augments our abilities to see, read and understand complex environments in a fast and reliable way: even though it might feel like a technology with a mind ofits own, it is a reflection of our own intelligence and always in our control the individual should be at the center of all al services we support in luxembourg: this attitude summarizes the governments strategic vision, which is, above all, human-centric al could contribute up to €. trillion to the global economy in , more than the current output of china and india combined: global gdp could be up to i4 percent higher in  as a result of al equivalent to an additional €i5. trillion making it the biggest commercial opportunity in todays fast- -changing economy study from the european commission highlights that the eu is among the geographical zones with the highest number of players active in al (%), just behind the united states (%) and just ahead of china (%). due to its low and fragmented investment levels for al, the eu wants to rapidly increase investment and reach a total of at least €zo billion in the period -. today, the eu is not considered a global leader in al. however; there is no reason to be shy about our achievements, as numbers of excellent european researchers and industrial actors have been driving al forward for decades, even while public interest ebbed and flowed  the european commission, meanwhile, has published multiple policy documents on the subject and will further strengthen the eus position in al, eg: by increasing funding budgets and identifying barriers to al adoption. its coordinated action plan on al, released in december  has established a number of important priorities for the eu. in addition, it under the leadership of the high-level expert group on al, published ethics guidelines for trustworthy al. luxembourgs strategic al vision was drafted with the european commission's priorities and the ethics guidelines in mind: p.  today,- large has,



to properly discuss al in this document; a definition is essential, since al has become an umbrella term comprising a number of technologies, such as robotics, automation, natural language processing, computer vision and data analytics a number of actors also use the term machine learning to describe computer software that optimizes itself based on a set of data, often to solve relatively narrow and specific tasks there are also concepts, such as assisted, augmented or autonomous intelligence, that describe different levels of artificial intelligence. in this strategic vision, we are defining artificial intelligence as a machines ability to mimic human behavior and, to an extent; human intelligence: this broad spectrum encompasses single tasks (think chess playing, translating or categorizing images) and complex activities (e:g. autonomous driving). general al will remain a topic to be monitored as technology evolves human intelligence in control of al thanks to digitalization, humanity is stockpiling data at an exponential rate: those with the most interesting datasets whether startups, industries or financial centers will truly profit from als potential. data markets are materializing, and we are seeing the rise ofa data-driven economy an opportunity for which luxembourg's government is extensively preparing thanks to a dedicated strategy developed at the ministry of the economy: more and more, it becomes evident that al is the liaison between data and societys most valuable products and services with the ability to scan, identify and translate troves of information into actionable conclusions, al lets us tap into the world s collective wisdom to solve local problems while al is not radically new, especially for luxembourgs researchers, it is on the threshold of accessible and applicable across industries and throughout society: digital health, finance, mobility, logistics; clean technologies, space and beyond not to mention education, environment and art: as with every high-potential technology, als integration will far-reaching consequences and some growing the increasing integration of al into existing workflows; for example; may raise new questions in terms of working conditions, employment law and labor relations that will need to be addressed by legislators in close cooperation with social partners (i.e. employer organizations and trade unions). p.  specific being bring pains.



challenges related to increased automation have to be considered alongside the opportunities of new jobs, which would give rise to new skill requirements and could potentially lead to a polarization of the labor market: the inclusive labor market policies pursued by the government are thus vital in ensuring that nobody is left behind. furthermore; data privacy and cybersecurity, already at the of the governments priority list, remain critical in the context of new al services, especially given that those services partially rely on personal data: technology= s applications should reflect the evolving desires and needs of citizens therefore, als role in society is not set in stone but will be determined along the way: lts capabilities will change and more importantly so will the purpose society defines for it: after all, the government does not support digitalization and new technology for their own sake but for their capacity to improve our daily lives. alis not only built by people, it is built for people. to make sure that al can best serve them, it needs to be understandable, transparent and, ultimately, trustworthy. a human-centric approach requires a level playing field among the diverse stakeholders investing, working and in luxembourg ensuring they all benefit from new technologies and the nations digitalization: p.  top living fully



luxembourg's government is firmly committed to fueling digitalization and high-potential technologies. this policy, however; is not an end in itself an important consequence of digitalization is an increase in the economys productivity. however; a purely economic goal is not sufficient: at the center point, the starting line and the end ofall al-related policies, you will find the individual. the government aims to raise awareness of al and help citizens develop a deeper understanding of it in order to transform them from merely passive consumers to active users of al-related products, services and technologies. should be aware ofboth its potential and its limitations with a human-centric approach, the government will focus its actions on purposeful policies that change the lives of citizens in each sphere: private life: daily, routine activities professional life: participation in luxembourg's diverse economy public life: interactions with the government and among citizens professional life increased job opportunities new revenue streams skills training public life private life human- time centric e-health high-quality education assistance data protection finance p. io goal they gain



alin our personal lives al has the potential to improve peoples daily lives in a non-obtrusive and intuitive way: individuals can benefit from al in many scenarios: assisted living, decision-making, health diagnostics/ treatments or traffic management; for example. with regard to mobility, a considerable amount of data is collected every while a amount ofhistoric data already exists the case study below displays how embedding al could lead to safer mobility; support traffic management or provide useful information on the most efficient modes of transportation. al will prove to be an essential tool when it comes to smart cities and sustainable solutions as it facilitates interconnection via the information modelling techniques of applied technologies, e-g: building efficiency, waste management; energy consumption and storage, parking accessibility and availability of electric charging stations for vehicles or bikes: use case: al for mobility tara and laurence havent met for coffee in over a week due to schedules, so are thrilled to finally be meeting this weekend in the city center: the question is, how will get there? tara uses an al-enabled app to her (avoiding routes that are congested), which uses predictive analytics to determine when she should leave in order to arrive on time. laurence decides to ride his bike to his appointment and is happy to have such air qualityl despite the existing transportation system, al makes travel more efficient and personalized. and, all arrive on time to their meeting: al preventive healthcare to the next level, while advancing diagnosis and treatment procedures, for instance in oncology the healthcare industry will experience boosted efficiency, real-time analysis, predictability and quality care. personalized medicine is a major priority for luxembourg: in the context ofits aging population, the countrys health institutions and healthcare providers need to leverage the new possibilities in preventive healthcare and map diseases to their advantage this will be a priority of the new e-health strategy prepared by the ministry of health: p. ii large day, busy they they guide good they will bring being



use case: al for health you have been feeling sick for days and it is only getting worse. you visit your doctor and, although he or she is not immediately sure how to help, and quick global search of your symptoms reveals a similar case in southeast asia. more detailed tests reaffirm the suspicion and within a few hours, you begin your personalized treatment; which successfully provides relief every year; hundreds of thousands of medical research papers, case studies and articles are released in dozens of languages all over the world, bringing a wealth of knowledge. al-powered search engines make that knowledge accessible to you and your doctor; improving diagnoses and treatment all industries and the people they serve will benefit from tailor-made advising, products and services luxembourgs public research actors are actively involved in developing state-of-the-art technologies, paving the way for smart cities and the technological applications that go with it (smart connectivity, smart mobility, smart health, smart living, etc) to improve urban life through integrated and sustainable solutions. p. i2



al in our professional life al can be an extraordinary source of relief for professionals. als strength is its ability to analyze large amounts of data in no time. so,it can carry out data-heavy work, while allowing humans to focus on their strengths: social relations, emotional intelligence, creativity and cultural sensitivity in this context, when humans and al join forces; enhance their complementary strengths, scaling up each others advantages. at the same time, the increasing integration of al into existing workflows may raise new questions in terms of the working conditions; employment law and labor relations that will need to be addressed by the legislator in close cooperation with social partners employer organizations and trade unions). use case: ai for employment it is march: your companys busiest month: several years ag0, this meant you were not able to leave the office before iopm, buried in towers of documents, racing against the clock but all that changed when your company started leveraging al tools that sift through hundreds of documents per second and present you with only the documents that require a second glance, and then help you make the right decisions you are done by .3opm and are even complimented for the quality ofyour work for many, their workloads keeps increasing, reducing the quality of their output: al-powered tools can improve the way work and eliminate unnecessarily stressful situations: al will impact both repetitive administrative tasks and major intellectual challenges without a doubt; it could be an excellent tool in cognitive tasks such as analyzing and reading legal texts or translating, via natural language processing tools al will not just affect low-skill, basic tasks, but also skill-intensive jobs. in the medical sphere, specialists are already discussing how to implement al applications to help define precise blood tests or improve diagnosis consensus. p.  they (e.g: you



use case: ai for networking identifying and tapping into professional opportunities takes patience and perseverance and, most importantly, some form of guidance from a professional. building your professional network with targeted suggestions thanks to career al tutors would have seemed surreal a few ago but welcome to reality: your entrepreneurial profile, past experiences and al-driven personality analytics enables you to receive personalized recommendations and build a network that aligns with your professional goals. in the domain of education, al could help in defining and generating personalized teaching/learning methods and tools, especially in the field of differentiated education: al could also simplify internal businesses processes (e.g: in companies or hospitals) regarding bzb exchanges or automatized internal communication procedures this evolution requires re- or up-skilling ofthe workforce, which hinges upon the commitment of both public and private institutions employees and civil servants will need training and lifelong learning that imparts an understanding of al analysis, applications, general functioning and implications the luxembourgish government already launched the digital skills bridge initiative, which aims to assist the private sector, not just in re-skilling its workforce, but also in acquiring the digital expertise to integrate digital products and services. use case: al for government services you have just arrived in luxembourg and cannot wait to start your new career: you go to your communes office at 8am to register _ as a resident and provide all necessary information: in your first six years of residency you find that you do not need to provide any further information or waste time out forms since the data is already saved thanks to al-powered tools. youre able to build a positive relationship with jill, who works at the commune, because your meetings are centered on meaningful discussions rather than the completion of redundant tasks, such as out administrative documents and, guess what? there's no queue: on the other hand, jill does not waste time asking for the same information or digging around for details. al-powered tools and intelligent software bots help her excel in her position and allocate time to making real connections, leaving her more fulfilled at work p. i4 years filling filling



al for citizens al has the potential to simplify citizen-government interactions society will benefit from access to improved, personalized public services, which will result in time-saving, increased transparency and more customer-oriented services. in the process of administrative simplification; public administrations could utilize al-based new technologies to offer more efficient and qualitative services to citizens and working in luxembourg: the government supports the digital by default principle, so it goes without saying that more and more procedures will be digitalized. a concrete example is the guichet lu portal, which is an online administrative website. through a chatbot engine or other al applications, the guichet.lu portal could boost efficiency and offer tailored and responsive services when talking about al, there is no way around the topic of data. in ,luxembourgs government launched the data public.lu portal an open data gateway to services that freely provides over  national datasets from different fields: environment, public health, geo-spatial, traffic and statistics the portal is a valuable, transparent tool, not just for citizens, but also for industries that want to develop digital applications. use case: al for civic engagement the world health organization estimates that i5 percent of people worldwide have some form of impairment that could lead to disability: sophia is a -year-old citizen who loves politics and social activities but cannot speak or walk due to cerebral palsy. to support sophia in her political endeavours, al-powered solutions with voice-control capabilities are being developed to ensure that she can take part in political discussions and be heard. al-powered tools for people with disabilities can make a meaningful difference in their ability to participate in all aspects of daily life. last but not least; digitalization and al with them significant opportunities and challenges that must be discussed and clarified before new technologies are fully embraced by citizens. the government of luxembourg remains accountable and transparent in its applications of al and digital tools. its digital inclusion efforts aim to simplify administration services and demystify the complexity of new digital applications by bringing them closer to citizens p. i5 living public bring public



ai in luxembourg where do we stand? regional cluster of al research excellence. in recent years, luxembourgs research community hosted by the university and the public research centers lih (luxembourg institute of health), liser (luxembourg institute of socio-economic research) and list (luxembourg institute of science and technology) has grown rapidly, representing solid, diverse learning expertise. at snt (interdisciplinary centre for security and trust), for example,  percent of the research projects are related to ai. however; al is not just present in academia  the national health laboratory for instance, is already using a new al informatics tool that can diagnose brain tumors based on a molecular marker; thus advancing their diagnosis capacity: or; consider the global success story that is talkwalker; a social listening company founded in luxembourg that relies heavily on various al technologies. at the same time; larger industrial actors like ses, husky or goodyear have started to use deep learning tools in their research and operational processes  startups that focus entirely on ai-based services or products have also sprung up: eg: aiva, tetrao, data"" and luxai: theres no doubt that luxembourgs al ecosystem is alive and well: number of international partnerships have been set up in luxembourg to foster the ecosystems potential. not only help luxembourgs al actors international visibility but open up access to cutting-edge resources if anything can make or break the arrival of innovation, it is access to advanced technology regional cluster of al research excellence luxembourg and the greater region lie in close geographical proximity to a number of al research centers that share an exceptional level of excellence, eg: inria in nancy dfki and the helmholtz-institut in saarbriicken: this high density of ai research leaders is unique in europe. luxembourg is strongly in favor of increasing collaborations between german, french and luxembourgish institutions by creating a new kind of research cluster dedicated to joint bids for international calls and multi-disciplinary research and relying on critical mass of al research: this virtual regional cluster would respond to calls from german and french national al strategy teams, building a strong franco-german cooperation in high- quality ai research: p. i6 deep things they gain



focus area human-centric approach requires us to consciously decide how to best integrate al into our personal and professional lives, as well as into our activities as citizens having developed the why, we shall now move onto the how of this strategic al vision. luxembourgs government agrees to work on the following focus areas:  luxembourgas a living laboratory for applied ai luxembourg understands the importance of transferring research findings to the real world. lts randd investments largely focus on applied research with international multidisciplinary centers of excellence, emphasizing on biology, cybersecurity, networking and trust: luxembourg bridges fundamental research and new market applications by experimenting and testing state-of-the-art technology in real-world environments, becoming a laboratory for tomorrows innovation to this end, the fnr supports several initiatives to enhance technology sharing, provides researchers with the opportunity to develop and commercialize their research and encourages the creation of research-based spinoffs (as it did with luxal, for example) in order to reap the benefits of research results, luxembourg will focus on the following key actions: prioritizing personalized medicine; which relies heavily on al-related technologies, in the new e-health strategy under preparation by the ministry of health. in the context of its aging and growing population, the countrys health institutions and healthcare providers need to take advantage of the new possibilities in preventive healthcare, diagnosis and the treatment of diseases: establishing world-reference testing facilities with other member states while optimizing investments and avoiding redundancies examples of such collaborations include luxembourg, germany and france testing connected and autonomous mobility on the first european cross- border experimental site in schengen, as well as the establishment of luxembourg as a health data hub in biomedicine and personalized medicine. in the financial services industry, with its wealth of international/cross-border datasets with potential commercial value for a number of industries, luxembourg is an attractive for cutting-edge technology developers: studying the feasibility of regulatory sandboxes to develop frameworks that can support luxembourg's role as a leading living laboratory (cf.  ethics and regulation). p. i7 living option



stimulating activities related to research, the funding of al products and services from relevant actors in the ecosystem (i.e. startups, smes) via initiatives such as luxinnovation's digital innovation hub. mapping of skills and expertise in the luxembourg research ecosystem, as well as al-related companies: . data: the cornerstone of al in recent years, luxembourg has demonstrated its commitment to building and consolidating large european data lakes to facilitate research-enabled solutions for society. a initiative is the national centre for excellence in research on parkinsons disease. it represents a joint effort between four research partners in luxembourg that brings together their parkinsons disease expertise. within luxembourgs advanced open data portal, public and private actors can share datasets to enable al-based services for researchers as well as public and private actors by sharing datasets. this strategic al vision is an opportunity to revisit and scale up the open data policy. as a long-term strategy, luxembourg will focus on enabling access to high-quality data and interoperable forms for researchers and companies to build and program their al applications this is in line with the ministry of the economys data-driven innovation strategy that develops a catalogue of action points in order to support new data-driven business models in economic sectors of high priority, namely industry ., logistic, eco-technologies, healthtech, financial services and space innovation: in order to ensure that data remains an asset to al, luxembourg will focus on the following key actions: identifying innovative regulation in the context of data marketplaces in order to increase legal certainty and transparency of data economy participants. relaunching the governments open data policy with a new roadmap, taking into account the public sectors crucial role as a data provider for al services development: working on projects to enhance quality and accessibility of data by supporting the development of data infrastructure. this infrastructure should enable the management and sharing of data in real time and experimentation through a sandbox of data-driven al-powered services, together with blockchain-based solutions for data integrity: creating an innovative and trusted regulatory environment in order to attract data-driven and data-centric services and businesses to luxembourg: (cf.also point  on ethics and regulations) p.  applied key



. ethics, privacy regulation and security exploring the links between privacy regulations, ethics, security and al is crucial. al applications that meet high standards of transparency will become essential to innovation. given the strategic importance and high complexity of this topic, luxembourg is keen to invest in an enhanced al- friendly framework this means looking at new regulation that can enable a functioning data marketplace, for example, in order to remove barriers to secure al development in addition, luxembourg will promote the ethics guidelines for trustworthy al released by the commissions high-level expert group on artificial intelligence. investments are needed in the development of effective human-al collaboration; humane and ethical automation and and the legal and societal implications of these technologies. in each case, research; funded partially by the fnr, can counterbalance private applied research; which may not always prioritize social digital luxembourg, the government initiative charged with unifying and strengthening the nations digitalization efforts, supports a number of projects that contribute to luxembourgs al ecosystem and could support similar non-profit organizations dedicated to al. in order to ensure that legal and ethical guidelines are implemented to protect fundamental rights and freedoms, luxembourg focus on the following actions: engaging with the national data protection authority and leveraging its expertise in order to address al-related questions: setting up a governmental technology and ethics advisory committee to discuss ethical implementations of technology and advising the government on potential risks and societal impacts. collaborating with bodies that work on developing and safeguarding corporate governance in luxembourg to accelerate the adoption of proper al corporate governance actively following, under the leadership of ilnas, international normalization processes in the field ofal, for example in the context of iso. developing and implementing innovative privacy-enhancing technologies for the use of datasets in the context of al learning: p. i9 al; public good. will key key large



. boosting investments and developing strategic partnerships luxembourg has been investing heavily in international connectivity, ict infrastructure and innovative projects for the past i5 years, often engaging in strategic partnerships the luxembourg commercial internet exchange (lu-cix), for example, encompasses a network of six data centers the groundwork for high-speed, high-volume data transfers, blockchain initiatives and cybersecurity initiatives, ensuring new investments in rdl and al infrastructure. likewise, luxembourgs high performance computing (hpc) initiative strives to open up access to expensive computing resources and expertise to a broad range of actors, thus lowering the barriers to entry for al-based products and services by mutualizing costs and pooling scarce skills. with these long-term investments, luxembourg has paved the way for the integration of the most cutting-edge technologies lts early actions have grown into excellent infrastructure, unparalleled on a national level and have already attracted global tech players to invest in our local ecosystem. on the randd side, the national research fund (fnr) funds project collaborations between researchers and companies in luxembourg, supporting public-private research on topics like advanced robotics, digital manufacturing, improved design tools and enhanced perceptual capabilities in al systems in order to remain a leader in al partnership investments, luxembourg will focus on the following actions: deploying and promoting the hpc initiative as a fundamental instrument in tomorrows al economy: spearheading the timely implementation of the eurohpc initiative in order to develop a pan- european supercomputing infrastructure: ensuring synergies between new public investments in rdl and infrastructures related to al activities for instance, by launching initiatives similar to the 5g pilot zones that will be emerging in luxembourg over the next years. 5g will enable connectivity in all domains of life, such as home, automotive, health, industrial production and much more: developing new partnerships in the field of al with leading firms in different disciplines to grow the number of al solutions and skills accessible to luxembourgs ecosystem. a chief example of this is the ongoing partnership with nvidia, which has led to the creation of a joint ai laboratory in luxembourg: connecting luxembourg with relevant al solutions, as wellas identifying and insourcing technology and service providers from abroad will become crucial for the local industry: such efforts are also undertaken by the luxembourg house of financial technology (lhoft) and luxembourg for finance, in the context of financial services, for example p.  public key - being

national ai strategy roadmap for the philippines introduction the fourth industrial revolution (fire) is set to transform industries at an unprecedented rate. it is a disruption that will change everything from products and processes to design philosophies and business models_a multifaceted  phenomenon   involving technology, people, and the environment. fire is supported by nine main technological pillars: big data and analytics; simulations, system integration, internet of things (lot), autonomous robots, cloud computing; cybersecurity, augmented reality (ar); and additive manufacturing: artificial intelligence (ai) has been projected to drive % of fire, with blockchain and cloud computing accounting for the other %. in fact, according to pwc's recent report; al could contribute a whopping uss15. trillion to the economy by . in southeast asia, mckinsey reports that al could be seen to open up opportunities in the region in that it could ""automate about % of the work activities performed in asean's four biggest economies; which include the philippines. furthermore, in an october  report by edbi and kearney, al is expected to boost southeast asia's gdp by up to uss1 trillion by  while al will uplift the philippine gdp by % in  equivalent to uss92 billion. in this light; a strong focus on al has significant potential to uplift the lives of filipinos, local industries, and the national economy it is no question that al can be expected to revolutionize many mundane aspects of our daily lives within the next decade  for one, the automotive industry will most likely be able to practically perfect autonomous vehicle  technology: the   synchronization of   vehicle movements will be straightforward, and it can be expected that tratfic congestion will be addressed and alleviated even in developing countries like the philippines: al-driven precision farming can also drastically decrease losses due to pests, and natural disasters, and can significantly increase outputs of high value products per hectare of land: having the right people and technology to handle the above concerns will not only allow wealth generation but also ensure inclusivity, as these will address the need for shared basic infrastructure that citizens need to be productive and contented: housing; transportation; and food security, among others: al is fueled by randd and innovation: hence, the philippines benefits from favorable changes in the local innovation and startup ecosystem. in , the local startup ecosystem ranked 54th out of  countries, an increase of  places from . in , the philippines rose to the rank out of  economies (up from 54th in ) in the annual global innovation index (gii), which has put the country in the  best-ranked lower middle-income economies # out of ). data executive survey "", newvantage partners llc, .  iiwww pwc com/gxlenlissuesldata-and-analyticslpublicationslartificial-intelligence-study html edbi; artificial intelligence could deliver a uss1 trillion to southeast asia's gdp by ""_ accessed from:  com/news-room/latest-newslartificial-intelligence-could-deliver-a-us1-trillion-uplift-to-southeast-asia- s-gdp-by- edbi and kearney, ""racing towards the future: artificial intelligence in southeast asia"", . pricewaterhousecoopers philippines, ""charging ahead: philippine startups break boundaries"" .  iiwwwpwc com/phlen/ceo-survey//pwcph-start up survey_2020 pdf global 50th top ""big uplift

national ai strategy roadmap for the philippines barriers to al adoption amongindustries in the philippines most enterprises and c-level executives worldwide are already largely cognizant of al's enormous impact on their business processes and products, but the philippines is slow in this realization and its embrace of al: to address these, the major barriers to al adoption for most organizations and enterprises in the philippines have been identified, as follows:  lack of understanding of data science and ai. organizations in the philippines still have   insufficient   knowledge of what al and data science are_ hence, cannot conceptualize how this new technology and set of tools can help their business processes and products: critically, are not willing to invest  money and other resources into something whose value and impact are not explicit nor tangible to them. among those with a degree of familiarity to al, concern about employee backlash due to the pace of change and job displacement tends to be an inhibitory factor. () lack of knowledge on potential use cases. perhaps another reason local industries and other organizations lack an understanding of the field of analytics is the scarcity of information on potential use cases of al. while many concrete examples exist outside of the philippines that are readily accessible via the news and from online resources, many local enterprises cannot connect or relate to these examples. many still seem far-fetched to local enterprises and the workforce. there is a need more potential use cases that are locally generated, so as to paint a more compelling picture for local stakeholders: () lack of resources. the lack of  resources is categorized into two forms: equipment (computational resources) and manpower (human resources). first, many enterprises, mostly micro, small, and medium enterprises (msmes) in the philippines are resource-challenged in terms of the capability to set up their own computational resource, including cloud computing resource, andlor even acquire business intelligence (bl) software to aid them in their data and system analysis second, most, if not all, industries in the country, especially those that have started to invest in al and data science, have been restricted by the scarcity of data experts, which include data analysts, data scientists, machine learning engineers, data engineers, data architects, and data stewards, among others furthermore, many of the data-skilled talents lack the required business skills to make al randd projects practical and profitable for the enterprises. lack of data strategy. data   strategy or al strategy is  essentially a vision for how organizations should invest their resources towards building capabilities in data science and al, anchored particularly on each company's strategic imperatives and business objectives. a common  misunderstanding is that a data strategy is all just about the data and the technology u e.g,, howlwhat to collect; where to store, what bl platforms to use, etc. rather , it is about acquiring technologies and technical capabilities can help enterprises achieve their strategic it is potentially disastrous when   organizations pour significant investments into digitization without charting their data/al strategy in alignment with their own many they they how goals.



national ai strategy roadmap for the philippines corporate vision. this  could result  in enormous monetary and opportunity losses: this particular barrier is more prevalent in large enterprises that have the financial capacity to invest in digitization, which include the capability to solve use cases with ml, but do not have the right people who are both technically and business savvy to bridge the gap between technology and business: () uncertainties about  legal and regulatory framework for al. by  setting out ethical boundaries to prevent indiscriminate and non-rights-respecting al applications and protections for both customers and businesses, a clear legal and regulatory framework for al will both protect the rights of filipinos and spur responsible adoption of and innovations in al. however, at the present, the philippines lacks a complete framework for such: indeed, as far as al has been in the public statements of lawmakers, more emphasis has been placed on its potential disruptive effects such as job losses, especially in the financially important bpo sector: fortunately, one component of the framework is currently present: the data privacy act of  (republic act no. ) , modelled after the european union's general data protection regulation, offers robust protections for data privacy: filling in the missing pieces of the puzzle is now the next step.



national ai strategy roadmap for the philippines thenational al strategy in , the philippine congress championed the approval of the philippine innovation act (republic act no. ) , aiming to fund and support randd efforts in the country towards national development: the act's main objective is ""to generate and scale up actions in all levels and areas of education, training; research, and development towards promoting innovation and internationalization activities of micro, small and medium enterprises as drivers of sustainable and inclusive growth.' consistent  with the law; the national artificial  intelligence (ai) strategy roadmap was formulated to guide government and private sector stakeholders in employing al technologies and developing al economies, while being mindful of the potential consequences and impacts of algorithms to processes and business models: its overall focus is on how al can be used to uplift the filipino people, improve the productivity of local industries, and enhance the competitiveness of the national economy: among the roadmap's main objectives are: . to maintain the regional and global competitiveness of filipino industries, noting that al is one of the biggest drivers of innovation for enterprises;  to identify areas (in both randd and technology application) for investing both time and resources of government; industry, and society, which includes harnessing existing global knowledge and new technologies that will aid in the development of new processes, products, and services for increasing productivity and for promoting overall public welfare;  to recommend ways for effectively fostering a triple-helix (randd) collaboration among government; industry, and the academe, which is essential to national development; 4_ to suggest approaches for preparing the future workforce for the jobs of the future; and . to attract the biggest industries to set shop in the country, and thus generating more jobs for the filipino people. the roadmap is organized according to pillars () , strategic dimensions (), strategic imperatives () , and strategic tasks (). the pillars and dimensions have been defined so as to ensure that the country has clear metrics in terms of tracking the progress of its implementation towards transforming the philippines into a globally competitive al-driven economy: it is divided into two pillars based on the structure of the global al index (gaii).  the first pillar is implementation which reflects the   operationalization of al by   practitioners in business, government and communities. the second pillar is innovation which reflects  technology the global al index. accessible at:  iiwww tortoisemedia com/intelligencelglobal-ail: key



national al strategy roadmap for the philippines breakthroughs and advancements in methodology that are indicative of greater capacity for al in the future. strategic dimensions comprise each pillar the first dimension is digitization and infrastructure as it is critical in achieving all the strategic goals defined in this roadmap. the second dimension is research and development that includes as subset 'investing in strategic sectors"" and 'international collaboration.' the third dimension is the workforce, which focus on anticipating and preparing for the potential impact of al technologies by ensuring enough talents and skilled practitioners that can deliver al solutions (more on application and implementation) and perform al research (academic and industry-driven): this dimension will also cover both reskilling and upskilling of the workforce. finally, the fourth dimension is regulation, which protects human rights and puts into place equitable al activating opportunities. digitalization and infrastructure; workforce development, and regulation fall under the implementation pillar of the roadmap, while research and development is under the innovation pillar. each of the   strategic dimensions consists of   strategic   imperatives. for digitization and infrastructure, these are to () build a robust connected and networked environment; and () improve data access and data value  extraction: for workforce development, ()  transform education and nurture future al talents, and () upskill and reskill the workforce. for regulation; () build an al ecosystem conscience. and lastly for research and development; () master and boundaries of al, and () accelerate innovation with al by helping industries innovate through al randd, supporting and nurturing al startups, and transforming institutions to maximize the impact of al randd: pillars strategic dimensions strategic imperatives strategic tasks build robust networked environment: digitization and infrastructure improve data access and data value extraction. nurture future al talents: implementation workforce development upskill and reskill workforce. regulation develop an al economy conscience accelerate innovation with al: innovation research + development master and push the boundaries of al: fig . national al strategy pillars, dimensions, imperatives, tasks push

norwegian ministry of local government and modernisation strategy national strategy for artificial intelligence



foreword it is difficult to predict the future, but we know that norway will be affected by the age wave; climate change and increasing global- isation, and that in the coming years we must work smarter and more efficiently to remain competitive and maintain the same level of welfare: digitalisation and new technologies are the to achieving this, and artificial intelligence will be a vital component artificial intelligence represents vast opportunities for us as individuals, for business and industry, and for the public sector. if used in the right way, technology can contribute to achieving the sustainable development goals not just in norway, but globally: there are many examples of al in use in norway, and in the coming years we will likely see many more, especially in business and industry and the public sector. while the united states and china have come far with consumer-oriented applications, our strength lies in the fact that our industry, business and public sector are more technologically advanced and digitalised than in most other countries norway is world-leading in the process industry, green shipping, aquaculture and petroleum activities. we have one of the most digitalised public sectors in the world. we must continue to build on these advantages in our development and use of artificial intelligence: norwegian society is characterised by trust and respect for fundamental values such as human rights and privacy: this is something we perhaps take for granted in norway, but leading the way in developing human-friendly and trustworthy artificial intelligence may prove a key advantage in today's global competition. there is no denying the fact that al also presents some difficult questions. who is responsible for the consequences of a decision that is made by al? what happens when autonomous systems make decisions which we disagree with and which, in a worst-case scenario, cause harm? and how do we make sure that the technology does not inten- tionally or unintentionally perpetuate and reinforce discrimination and prejudice? when faced with dilemmas like these, it can be useful to have some fundamental principles to turn to for guidance: transparency, explainability and cautious testing: these principles must also be applied when we develop and use solutions built on artificial intelligence: while working on this strategy have had opportunities to meet people who work on artificial intelligence in academia, business and industry, and the public sector. have had meetings with employer and employee organisations who see that artificial intelligence will impact the labour market in the time ahead. an overview of most of these meetings is available at www regjeringen no/ki-strategi, with all the written input received: would like to thank everyone who shared their engagement and insights: hope this strategy can serve as a framework for both public and private entities seeking to develop and use artificial intelligence: together we will explore the potential that lies in this exciting technologyl kuth: ststp nikolai astrup minister of digitalisation key good along

developing and using al with respect for individual rights and freedoms: this can become a advantage in today's global competition: the government believes that: artificial intelligence that is developed and used in norway should be built on ethical principles and respect human rights and democracy research, development and use of artificial intelligence in norway should promote responsible and trustworthy al development and use of al in norway should safeguard the integrity and privacy of the individual security should be built into the development; operation and administration of systems that use al supervisory authorities should oversee that al systems in their areas of supervision are operated in accordance with the principles for responsible and trustworthy use of al basis for artificial intelligence the government will facilitate world-class al infrastructure in norway in the form of digitalisation-friendly regulations, good language resources, fast and robust communication networks, and sufficient computing power. it will facilitate data sharing within and across industries and sectors_ data data is vital for the development and use of al. today vast amounts of information are generated from many different sources. al and machine learning can use this data to give us important insights. access to high-quality datasets is essential for exploiting the potential of al: the government will facilitate data sharing in both the public and private sectors and between sectors_ regulations the government will evaluate whether there are regulations that hamper appropriate and desired use of artificial intelligence in the public and private sectors. there will be requirements for transparency and accountability in new systems for public administration in which al is used. the government is positive towards establishing regulatory sandboxes in areas where this is called for. such initiatives already exist in connection with autonomous transport: the government will also establish an advisory body and a regulatory sandbox for al in the area of data protection: language language technologies such as speech recognition and language comprehension represent an important component of al. to enable norwegian citizens to participate in increasingly advanced services in their own language, we need good language resources in both norwegian language forms and in sami: the government will facilitate the collection of and access to language resources key cyber good



communication networks and computing power development and use of al requires a sound communication infrastructure and access to computing the work on communication infrastructure; and on 5g networks in particular,; is a priority area for the government: access to sufficient computing power will be secured through the use of national and international resources for high- performance computing: developing and leveraging artificial intelligence norway will invest in al in areas where we have distinct advantages, such as health, seas and oceans, public administration, energy and mobility: the government wants norwegian organisations to be attractive cooperation partners for leading business and research communities in al. norway will continue to pursue its investment in basic and applied ict research: instruments that stimulate investment in strong research communities, such as the research council of norway's centre schemes, will be central to al investments: artificial intelligence will have a dominant place in horizon europe, the eu's next framework programme for research and innovation. moreover; the eu has proposed the establishment of a comprehensive digitalisation programme; digital europe programme (dep), for the period -. the programme will focus on initiatives in high-performance computing and artificial intelligence. the government has signed a non-binding declaration of intent to participate in horizon europe and will consider norway's participation in dep from . norway will have advanced skills, including in basic ict research and al research, in order to understand and benefit from changes in technological developments. this requires good study programmes that coincide with the needs of different sectors for advanced skills in artificial intelligence and in basic subjects such as statistics, mathematics and information technology: al and related topics such as ethics and data protection associated with applications of al will also be important in areas such as law and other professional programmes institutions of higher education ought to evaluate how topics with relevance to artificial intelligence can be integrated into their programmes in areas that will be affected by artificial intelligence in the coming years. technological development will lead to changes in the labour market; and the pace of change is likely to accelerate. opportunities for upskilling and reskilling both in the workplace and in the form of study programmes will therefore be increasingly important as applications of al become more widespread in the labour market: the government will present a white paper on a skills reform, and has already begun work on flexible further educational programmes both for digital skills and for employees who must adapt their skills as a result of digitalisation and the transition to a green society: enhancing innovation capacity using artificial intelligence the government wants norway to exploit the innovative potential of artificial intelligence. norway can take a leading position in applying artificial intelligence, particularly in areas where we already are well positioned and have strong research power. policy



and business communities, such as health, oil and gas, energy, the maritime and marine industries and the public sector. the government will consider how industrial policy instruments can best be designed to support the potential value creation and use of al in the business sector. public agencies ought to actively explore the potential of artificial intelligence, and increased interaction between the public sector and the business sector should promote innovation and value creation: the public sector ought to actively explore opportunities in the market in connection with procurements, and innovative public procurements should be used where appropriate: to facilitate innovative solutions, the agencies ought to focus on their needs rather than on concrete products or services responsible and trustworthy artificial intelligence development and use of al can also present challenges, in particular for al that builds on personal data: there is therefore a need for continuous discussion about what is responsible and desirable development and about what can be done to prevent adverse development: the government wants norway to lead the way in developing and using al with respect for individual rights and freedoms. in norway, artificial intelligence will be based on ethical principles, respect for privacy and data protection and good cyber security: norway will continue to participate in european and international forums to promote responsible and trustworthy use of al. about the strategy the national strategy for artificial intelligence is intended for the civilian sector both private and public. it does not cover the defence sector. the strategy focuses on specifying what is meant by artificial intelligence and on describing some areas where it will be important for norway to exploit the opportunities offered by ai. artificial intelligence is an area that is constantly evolving: for this reason, no specific time period is applied to the strategy. there will be a need to adjust and evaluate the strategy at appropriate intervals, in line with technological and social developments. this strategy must also be viewed in connection with other important work by the government; such as the digitalisation strategy for the public sector' , a new public administration act2 , a review of the system of business-oriented policy instruments: , the skills reform for lifelong learning (laere hele livet), health data regulation4, and several other small- and large-scale initiatives that are discussed in the strategy: ministry of local government and modernisation (): one digital public sector. digital strategy for the public sector - nou :  ny forvaltningslov ~lov om saksbehandlingen offentlig forvaltning (forvaltningsloven) [official norwegian report on a new public administration act] information on this work is available (in norwegian) at: wwwregjeringen no/vmg information on follow-up of the work of the health data commission is available (in norwegian) at: wwwregjeringen no/no/dokument/dep/hod/saklhelsedatautvalget/id2595894l and helse- og omsorgsdepartementet (): horing tilgjengeliggjoring av helsedata (endringer i helseregisterloven m.m:) [ministry for health and care services (): public hearing on making health data available and amending the health register act]



artificial intelligence systems perform actions, physically or digitally, based on interpreting and processing structured nothing with alv , emanuel gollob (at) or unstructured data, to achieve a given goal. photo: electronica what is al? . definition definitions of artificial intelligence (al) vary considerably, and often change in line with what is technologically possible. this strategy takes the definition proposed by the european commission's high-level expert group on artificial intelligence' as its starting point; and defines al as: al systems act in the physical or digital dimension by perceiving their environment; processing and interpreting information and deciding the best action(s) to take to achieve the given some al systems can adapt their behaviour by analysing how the environment is affected by their previous actions. as a scientific discipline, artificial intelligence embraces various approaches and technologies, such as machine learning (including for example, deep learning and reinforcement learning), machine reasoning (including planning; search and optimisation), and certain methodologies in robotics (such as control, sensors, and integration with other technologies in cyber physical systems): high-level expert group on artificial intelligence set up by the european commission (): a definition of al: main capabilities and scientific disciplines doing ars goal.

'strong' and 'weak' artificial intelligence we are still a way from a form of artificial intelligence that resembles human intelligence, or artificial general intelligence (agi): artificial general intelligence is often referred to as 'strong al' while other forms are referred to as 'weak al' or 'narrow ai'. this does not mean that al systems that are designed for a specific 'narrow' area cannot be powerful or effective, but they more often refer to specific systems designed to perform single task, such as image processing or pattern recognition, for specific purposes: nor is it the case that al developed in parallel in many specific areas, or research on 'weak al', necessarily brings us closer to artificial general intelligence. our definition embraces both 'strong' and 'weak' artificial intelligence: rule-based systems for automation rule-based it system is often built on rules such as 'if x happens; then do y'. such rules can be organised in complex decision trees rule-based automation systems can be used to model regulations, business logic or experience-based practice (exercise of discretion): of the systems used for automated administrative processing in the public sector are rule-based. our definition of artificial intelligence covers some of these systems, depending on factors such as the complexity of the rule set: . how does artificial intelligence work? a system based on artificial intelligence can either interpret data from devices such as sensors, cameras, microphones or pressure gauges or can be fed input data from other information sources. the system analyses the data, makes decisions and performs actions both the need for data and the fact that it is the system that makes decisions and performs actions raise ethical issues that are discussed in chapter .  long many



some types of systems have a feedback which enables the artificial intelligence to learn either from its own experiences or from direct feedback from users or operators. the artificial intelligence system is usually embedded as a component within a larger system. tasks are often performed digitally, as part of an it system, but al systems can also be part of a physical solution, such as a robot examples of current practical applications of al are: computer vision/identification of objects in images: can be used for purposes such as facial recognition or for identifying cancerous tumours: pattern recognition or anomaly detection: can be used to, for example, expose bank or insurance fraud or to detect data security breaches: natural language processing (nlp): can be used to sort and categorise documents and information, and to extract relevant elements from vast datasets. robotics: can be used to develop autonomous vehicles such as cars, ships and drones. development in some areas has progressed rapidly, and we are already seeing systems being used in practice: development and testing in other areas can take longer to achieve reliable and verified results. machine learning today when we hear about systems being based on artificial intelligence; they are usually based on machine learning: unlike rule-based systems, where rules are defined by humans and are often based on expert experience, business logic or regulations, the concept of machine learning covers a range of different technologies where the rules are deduced from the data on which the system is trained: in ai systems developed by machine learning, the machine learning algorithms build mathematical models based on example data or training data. these models are then used to make decisions: machine learning algorithms usually learn in three different ways: supervised learning: the algorithm is trained with a dataset where both input data and output data are given. in other words, the algorithm is fed both the 'task' and the 'solution' and uses them to build the model. this will make it capable of making a decision based on input data. non-supervised learning: the algorithm is fed only a dataset without a 'solution' and must find patterns in the dataset which then can be used to make decisions about new input data. deep learning algorithms can be trained using non-supervised learning: reinforcement learning: the algorithm builds its model based on non- supervised learning but receives feedback from the user or operator on whether the decision it proposes is good or bad: the feedback is fed into the system and contributes to improving the model.  loop

the government will facilitate world-class al infrastructure in norway in <data urnsw, daniel huber (at) the form of digitalisation-friendly regulations, language resources photo: ars electronica fast and robust communication networks; and sufficient computing it will facilitate data sharing within and across industries and sectors:  a good basis for al . data and data management data is vital to al. today vast datasets are generated from many different sources: al and machine learning can use this data to provide important insights. access to high- quality datasets is decisive for exploiting the potential of al. the government's goal is to facilitate sharing of data from the public sector so that business and industry, academia and civil society can use the data in new ways: data can be regarded as a renewable resource. sharing data with others does not mean that one is left with less data. in fact; the value of data can increase when shared because it can be combined with other types of data that can offer new insights or be used by organisations with the expertise to use the data in new and innovative ways: open public data in principle, all information that is lawfully published on public websites can also be made accessible as open data. personal data that is exempt from public disclosure or that is subject to confidentiality must not; however, be made accessible unless specific reasons apply for doing so. weather data from the norwegian meteorological institute and traffic information from the norwegian public roads administration are examples of open data from the public sector: personal data the issues related to sharing and data are closely connected to the type of data involved. it is important to distinguish between use of personal data and use of data that cannot be traced back to specific individuals, such as weather data. use of  good power: using



personal data for developing al raises a number of issues that must be addressed before such data can be shared or used: data sharing principles principles for sharing open public data even though there is no statutory obligation that requires open public data to be made accessible; the government's goal is for such data to be shared so that it can be used by others (what we refer to as 'reuse') report to the storting no.  (-) digital agenda for norway: ict for a simpler everyday life and increased productivity highlighted five sectors where reuse of open public data is regarded to be of particular economic value: culture, research and education, government expenditure, transport and communications, and maps and property (geodata) specific strategies have been developed for data sharing in these areas. furthermore, the norwegian government agency for financial management (dfo) has developed a system for publishing data pertaining to public expenditure: the freedom of information act regulates how public data should be made available for reuse: since ,the digitalisation circular has required government agencies which establish new or upgrade existing it-systems or digital services to make data from these accessible in machine-readable formats. the agency should arrange for data to be accessible in the long term, with integrity, authenticity, usability and reliability intact: the nordic countries share many interests and values with respect to artificial intelligence. the nordic countries therefore cooperate through the nordic council of ministers in several areas related to ai: one of these areas concerns data: a working group has been formed to identify datasets that can be exchanged between nordic countries and create added value for nordic enterprises public and private alike while still respecting the ethical aspects and the trust and values particular to the nordic countries. one important measure in the digitalisation strategy for the public sector6 is to establish a national resource centre for data sharing in the norwegian digitalisation agency. the centre is intended to serve as a knowledge hub, and one of its tasks will be to increase awareness about the value of sharing data: principles for data sharing between public-sector agencies the government has established a 'once only' principle to ensure that citizens and businesses do not have to provide identical information to multiple public bodies. updated and quality-assured information that is shared across public administrations is a prerequisite for implementing the once-only principle, and is important for developing better, more coherent public services: some information is held in central registries, such as the national population register and the central coordinating register for legal entities, but a lot of information exists outside such registries. to facilitate sharing of this data between public agencies, the ministry of local government and modernisation (): one digital public sector: digital strategy for the public sector - report to the storting no.

bronnoysund register centre and the norwegian digitalisation agency have established the national data directory to provide an overview of the types of data held by various public agencies, how are related, and what they mean: this catalogue will also provide information on whether data may be shared and on what terms: the digitalisation circular requires agencies to publish data that can be shared with others in the national data directory and on data norgeno. principles for publicly funded research data research that is publicly funded should benefit everyone. it is therefore important that research data be made accessible to as many as possible; to other researchers as well as to public administration and the business sector. better access to research data can boost innovation and value creation by enabling actors outside research communities to find new areas of application. it can also contribute to smarter service development in the public sector, opportunities for new business activities, and new jobs. there is no doubt that far more datasets from research can be made accessible, along with pertinent protocols, methods, models, software and source codes such access must be safeguarded by sound data protection practices and give due consideration to security, intellectual property rights and business secrets. however, the vast and growing amount of research data means that not all data can be archived and maintained for the same periods. the costs of making datasets genuinely reusable must be weighed against the benefit to research communities and society: the government has presented a strategy on access to and sharing of research data. the strategy sets out three basic principles for publicly funded research data in norway: research data must be as open as possible, and as closed as necessary: research data should be managed and curated to take full advantage of its potential value: decisions concerning the archiving and curation of research data must be made within the research community: framework for data sharing in the industry sector in germany, a framework for sharing data in the industry sector, international data spaces, was established in connection with the industry . initiative the initiative has been expanded to industry sectors in other countries, and in norway sintef has enabled norwegian companies to use the framework the framework offers a common infrastructure for the secure storage of industry data: the framework offers companies control of their own data while enabling them to share it if they wish to do so. sources: fraunhofer institut, sintef ministry of education and research (): national strategy on access to and sharing of research data  they long



principles for data sharing in the business sector in principle, companies own their own data, and it is up to each company to decide how it wants to use its data within the parameters of data protection regulations few industries and businesses are aware of the value of data sharing: many companies have a poor overview of their own data, and therefore have neither categorised it nor assessed its potential benefit to themselves or to other organisations norway has some examples of voluntary data sharing within the private sector and between businesses and the public sector: the oil and gas industry: in  the norwegian petroleum directorate and the oil companies operating in the norwegian continental shelf established the diskos national data repository (diskos) diskos is a national data repository of information related to exploration and extraction from the norwegian shelf: the data is directly accessible online to members of the diskos joint venture. the idea behind diskos is that the oil companies should all cooperate on storing exploration data and compete in interpreting it.  geodata: norway digital is a broad cooperation programme between agencies that are responsible for obtaining geospatial information and/or that are large users of such information: the cooperation partners comprise municipalities, counties, national agencies and private enterprises such as telecom and power companies."" geonorgeno is a national website that has been created for weather data and other geospatial information in norway under the norway digital partnership: the authorities are generally hesitant about requiring private enterprises to share data. the government's position is that private enterprises with a mutual interest in sharing data should do so on their own initiative. nonetheless, this can prove difficult to achieve in practice. the government has set out the following principles for sharing data from the business sector: voluntary data sharing is preferable, particularly between parties with a mutual interest in sharing data. the authorities can facilitate the sharing of data where the enterprises themselves don't see the value in sharing if sharing such data would enhance public benefit: data sharing may be imposed if necessary; for example for reasons of public interest. data must be shared in such a way that individuals and businesses retain control of their own data: privacy and business interests must be safeguarded: veritas technologies llc (): the databerg report: see what others don't ministry of petroleum and energy (): diskos  years of service for petroleum geology. wwwgeonorge no/enl  the principles are inspired by: dutch ministry of economic affairs and climate policy (): dutch vision on data sharing between businesses 



some activities in the business sector are performed for the public sector or under permits or licences granted by public authorities public agencies have taken little advantage of opportunities to set requirements for data access or sharing in connection with entering into contracts or awarding licences: the government will therefore consider whether the public sector can contribute to making more datasets from the business sector accessible by setting requirements for data sharing in conjunction with entering into public contracts wherever appropriate: the government will also consider evaluating requirements to make data publicly accessible in licensing areas where such access is considered to be of particular benefit to society: methods of sharing data variety of methods are available that can make it simpler and safer to share data between different stakeholders: data lakes data lake is a central repository for storing data, such as a cloud service: the data can be stored as is, in its original format; and can be a combination of structured and unstructured data: the data need not be structured or labelled: the data lake can then be used to retrieve data for machine learning or for other analyses: data trusts data trust is a legal structure where a trusted third party is responsible for the data to be shared: the third party decides which data should be shared with whom, in compliance with the purpose for which the data trust was set up. anonymisation interface an anonymisation interface allows various analyses to be carried out on register data containing personal data from multiple data sources without being able to identify individuals. the remote access infrastructure for register data (raird) is a cooperation project between the norwegian social science data services and statistics norway on such an anonymisation interface. the information model for raird is openly accessible and can be used by anyone13 synthetic data synthetic data can in many cases be an alternative to identifiable data or anonymised data. if synthetic datasets can be produced with the same features as the original dataset; they can be used to train algorithms or be used as test data: this means that even datasets which normally would be considered sensitive could be made openly accessible for use in research and innovation. common open application programming interfaces an application programming interface (api) makes it possible to search directly in a data source to retrieve the desired data. this is a prerequisite for being able to use data in real time. the digitalisation circular establishes that public agencies must make appropriate information available in machine-readable and preferably standardised formats, ideally using apis.  raird information model rim vi_0 accessible at  iistatswiki_unece org/displaylgsim /rard-informationtmodel+rimtvl q 



generation of synthetic test data for the national registry the norwegian tax administration is in the process of developing a solution in which machine learning is used to generate rich synthetic test data in a dedicated test environment for the national registry. the synthetic national registry will offer synthetic test subjects in addition to simulating events. the objective is to allow enterprises that use information from the national registry to test their integrations without using authentic personal data in the tests. initially the synthetic national registry will be made available to parties needing to test integration with the national registry. eventually it will be available to everyone who needs national registry data for testing purposes source: norwegian tax administration white paper on the data-driven economy the government will prepare a white paper on data sharing and the data-driven economy: the white paper will discuss important issues such as data ownership, incentives for sharing data, and possibilities for equitable sharing of the economic from a global digital data economy: other important issues are data protection, secure data sharing, and ethical use of data the white paper will also discuss issues relating to competence in data science and data sharing, and to infrastructure for data capture and sharing: as part of the work on preparing the white paper, the minister of digitalisation will appoint an expert group to examine the prerequisites and terms for sharing data within and from the business sector. the government will present a white paper on the data-driven economy and innovation establish a resource centre for data sharing; with expertise in the relationship between law, technology, business and administrative processes establish a set of principles for extracting and managing data from central registries, and a common api catalogue to promote better utilisation of basic data by providing an overview of data interfaces (apis) consider policy instruments that can make it easier for industry sectors to share data and that simultaneously safeguard privacy and data protection, security, and business interests give guidance to public agencies on how they can ensure access to data when entering into contracts by, for example, proposing standard clauses consider which areas it may be in the public interest to require that data from the business sector be made accessible, and examine whether requirements for data access in connection with licences might be a suitable policy instrument in this regard gains



. language data and language resources language technology in the form of, for example, speech recognition and language comprehension, represents a key component in al. natural language processing (nlp) involves registering natural language (text/audio) and understanding the meaning and context: natural language generation (nlg) involves producing text based on data: these technologies combined are important in the development of virtual assistants and in analyses based on unstructured data. to make systems like these accessible in written norwegian and sami and in dialects, the technology must be adapted to these languages and to local conditions. this requires language resources. sprakbanken, a service provided by the national library of norway, makes language data available for developing language technology in norwegian: the national library of norway and the language council of norway will cooperate by coordinating their efforts to further develop the resources held in sprakbanken: they also have a responsibility to make sure that the public sector as buyer, and developer communities in both the public and private sectors, be informed about and request these language resources the sami languages are particularly vulnerable. language technology and language technology resources in sami are important for contributing to future development and use of the language and eventually for developing services in sami based on artificial intelligence. divvun and giellatekno, the research group for saami language technology at the arctic university of norway, are both developing different language technology tools for sami: the government will return to the issue of sami language data and language resources in a white paper on sami language, culture and society: the main topic of the white paper will be digitalisation. one ofthe challenges in the work on facilitating language technology in norwegian and sami is obtaining sufficient amounts of language data within different domains, such as medicine, ict and transport: there is a need for both written and oral data that covers dialects and pronunciation variations examples of useful resources include analysis and classification of unstructured data in the mfa every year; the ministry of foreign affairs (mfa) receives up to , reports from norwegian embassies, delegations, etc. previously it was extremely difficult to navigate all this information. since the mfa adopted machine learning and nlp to analyse and classify the content of these documents, it has been possible to find almost all relevant information on a given subject matter. the solution is also used to extract information in reports and prepare summaries. in the work on developing this solution, the mfa cooperated with the university of oslo, which provided solutions for categorising the norwegian language. the plan is to gradually expand the solution with information from archives and external research reports source: ministry of foreign affairs  key



multilingual terminology lists, area-specific texts and speech recordings or parallel texts in different languages: the linguistic structures in text produced by the public sector constitute valuable data for language technology research and development: it is important to facilitate reuse for these purposes. there is reason to believe that the public sector possesses far more data that could be used in developing language technology than it realises the government will there- fore promote awareness of language data and language resources in the public sector by, among other things, addressing such data specifically in the digitalisation circular. the ministry of local government and modernisation has strengthened the infor- mation management resource centre in the norwegian digitalisation agency in order to facilitate closer cooperation with the national library and the language council of norway: the agencies will cooperate on strategies to ensure that public language resources can be used for language technology purposes, guidance on what can be regarded as language resources and on ensuring deposits of language resources for sprakbanken: language technology aids tuva is an aid for dictating text (speech recognition) and navigating a pc voice control the product was developed by max manus in  and is provided to people with permanent disabilities the solution uses al and builds on resources from sprakbanken: the dataset developed specially for this system is now openly accessible to other developers in sprakbanken: etranslation is a machine translation service developed by the eu that can be used by the public sector in the eea area_ the functionality for norwegian is built on translations by the unit for eea translation services in the mfa, translations by semantix for public agencies and from standards translated by standard norway: sprakbanken makes the datasets accessible to developers and researchers. source: ministry of culture the government will make a recommendation in the digitalisation circular that text produced by the public sector be made available for language technology purposes and deposited in sprakbanken at the national library and the national term bank: formulate standard clauses for use in public-sector contracts in order to give the public sector rights to the language resources produced by translation services and other language-related services present a white paper on language continue cooperating with the university of oslo on plain and digitalisation- friendly legal language present a white paper on sami language, culture and society that focuses on digitalisation using



. regulations norway has a tradition for modernising its legal framework to meet new technological developments, starting with the eregulation project'4in . the aim is to make laws and regulations as technology-neutral as possible so that they can be applied even when new technologies and digitalisation change our society and the way we live. at the same time; we often see that regulation is called for when new technologies give rise to problematic applications we have seen examples of this with artificial intelligence in connection with electoral manipulation in social media and 'deep fakes'. however; it is challenging and often inexpedient to regulate a technology that is still in an early phase. regulating too early can have unintended consequences on developments, disrupt the market and reduce the potential for innovation: moreover, any technology will often have both positive and negative applications. the same underlying technology used to produce deep fakes can also be used for example, create synthetic data, a technology that helps protect personal data. digitalisation-friendly regulations the government wants the legal framework to reflect the opportunities and challenges that come with new technology, including artificial intelligence. it also wants regulations to be digitalisation friendly. regulations ought to facilitate fully and partly automated administrative proceedings and not contain unnecessary discretionary provisions  regulations suitable for automated administrative proceedings ought to be machine-readable so that they can be used al-systems. there is a need to consider whether there are areas where regulations impose inexpedient and adverse limitations on the development and use of artificial intelligence. among other things, there is a need to review laws that apply to some public agencies to see how the regulations can better facilitate sharing and using data and developing and using artificial intelligence. such a process will require thoroughly reviewing sector-specific regulations and drawing on cross-sectoral expertise so that consideration is given to society's needs, the individual's right to privacy, and the technological possibilities. this work must be viewed in connection with the regulatory review aimed at removing barriers to digitalisation and innovation, as discussed in the government's digital strategy for the public sector. areas that create particular challenges: interoperability the fact that different sector-specific regulations use the same concepts in different ways can present challenges. income, for example; does not mean the same in the norwegian tax administration as it does in the norwegian labour and welfare administration (nav), and the concept of co-habitant is defined in a variety of ways in different regulations the government aims to achieve semantic interoperability in its ot:prp. nr:  (-) om iov om endringer i diverse lover for and fjerne hindringer for elektronisk kommunikasjon [draft resolution and bill to amend various acts in order to remove obstacles for electronic communication] ministry of local government and modernisation (): one digital public sector. digital strategy for the public sector -  to,



legislation to make it easier to be read by machines and used for artificial intelligence: if concepts do not have the same meaning it is important to have information on this to prevent the system from producing misleading results. personal data: consent and statutory authority personal data is covered by the personal data act: the principle of purpose limitation means that the purpose for processing personal data must be clearly stated and established when the data is collected: this is fundamental to ensuring that individuals have control of their data and can give informed consent to data processing: development and use of artificial intelligence often require different types of personal data; data which in some cases was originally collected for other purposes moreover, processing of data such as health data may be subject to other regulations, such as the health registries act: the most widespread way of gaining lawful access to personal data for use in al is consent: consent is often obtained by the users' approving an end user agreement and consenting to data processing when want to use a service. the agreement should state, among other things, how the will use the data collected and with whom it may be shared: it must also be possible to withdraw consent; and some services allow end users to administer how their personal data is used in more detail: the public sector often collects and processes personal data without the explicit consent of the user. in such cases, collection is based on a statutory provision that provides legal basis to collect and use data on citizens for specific purposes norway currently has no common system whereby citizens can see what information is collected and administered by the public sector, though solutions have been established in some important areas, such as helsenorgeno. here users can administer which healthcare personnel may access their summary care record and clinical documents; withdraw their consent to be registered in certain health registries; and grant power of attorney to family members datasets that are based on consent will in most cases be incomplete or contain bias that may influence the outcome of any analyses performed on the data. this is an important reason for having central registries where registration is statutory and mandatory: when personal data is collected pursuant to a statutory provision, opportunities to use the data for purposes other than the original purpose are limited unless the new use is also permitted by a statutory provision. this means that public agencies have little scope to use the data they collect to perform analyses on their own activities ai beyond the statutory authority provided for the relevant dataset: the government wants to expand the scope for public agencies to use their data to develop and use al regulatory challenges in the health area there may be a need to develop regulatory frameworks in some health-related areas before testing of methods based on al takes place. other areas are already safeguarded under existing regulations. for example, algorithms used in medical equipment software, such as surgical robots or software for enhancing or processing images in diagnostic imaging instruments, are subject to regulation of medical equipment: the norwegian medicines agency provides guidance and supervises compliance with regulations governing such equipment in the norwegian market;  they entity using



development and use of tools based on artificial intelligence are dependent on information from sources beyond the individual patients who receive health care in a specific case: use of data for patient treatment and use of patient data for research purposes (secondary use) are currently regulated differently. the current regulations provide no clear legal basis for using health data pertaining to one patient to provide healthcare to the next patient unless the patient gives consent: however, exemption from the duty of confidentiality may be granted to use patient data for research purposes: artificial intelligence challenges the distinction between research purposes and patient treatment because there is often a need to include patient data from research when al-based tools developed in a research project are used to provide treatment: exemption from the duty of confidentiality will no longer apply in such cases, and the use of personal data will no longer be legally permitted: in july  the ministry of health and care services distributed a proposal for consultation regarding access to health data and other health-related data in health registries. the proposal concerns access to health data for use in statistics, health analyses, research, quality improvement; planning, management and emergency preparedness in order to promote health, prevent disease and injury, and provide better health and care services. the ministry of health and care services is also considering amendments to regulations governing access to health data in connection with teaching and quality assurance: this work includes reviewing permission to use health data in decision support tools. moreover, the norwegian directorate of health, the directorate of ehealth and the norwegian medicines agency have, in consultation with the regional health authorities, been tasked with identifying the opportunities and challenges posed by artificial intelligence and what adaptations in regulatory conditions at national level night be needed: in the long term, more tasks which today are performed by healthcare personnel may be performed by autonomous systems and artificial intelligence: relevant examples span from automatic generation of patient records, patient logistics and fleet management of the ambulance service to autonomous surgical robots. although the scope of automation and autonomous tools will expand in the health sector, health personnel will still be responsible for ensuring proper provision of healthcare health analysis platform the government will establish a health analysis platform, a national system for making health data accessible for research purposes and for other, secondary uses: the platform will allow more advanced analysis of norwegian health data and will form the basis for new types of medical and health research. among other things, it will allow health data to be used more actively in developing medicines and medical technology. source: norwegian directorate of ehealth  helse- 0g omsorgsdepartementet (): horing tilgjengeliggjoring av helsedata (endringer i helseregisterloven m.m: [ministry of health and care services (): public hearing on making health data available and amending the health register act] 



regulatory sandboxes regulatory sandboxes are first and foremost a policy instrument for promoting responsible innovation. a regulatory sandbox is intended to give enterprises opportunities to test new technologies and/or business models within specific parameters in this strategy the concept is used to refer to: legislative amendments that allow trials, for example subject to application, usually within a limited geographical area or time period more comprehensive measures in areas where close monitoring and supervision is needed, usually by the relevant supervisory authority the concept of regulatory sandboxes is best known in the financial sector, where supervisory authorities in several countries have given enterprises opportunities to test specific products, technologies or services on a limited number of customers for a limited time period and under close monitoring: in december  the norwegian financial supervisory authority (finanstilsynet) established a regulatory sandbox for financial technology (fintech): the purpose of the sandbox is to expand finanstilsynets understanding of new technological solutions in financial markets, while at the same time expanding enterprises' understanding of regulatory requirements and how they are applied to new business models, products and services however, it makes little sense to talk about one regulatory sandbox for ai. al solutions do not represent a homogeneous group of services, and are subject to a broad spectrum of regulations and regulatory authorities, depending on their purpose and functionality: the government has already established regulatory sandboxes in the area of transportation, in the form of legislative amendments that allow testing activities. an act has been introduced allowing pilot projects on autonomous vehicles. the act entered into force on january . the norwegian maritime authorities established the first test bed for autonomous vessels as early as . a further two test beds have since been approved. in  the storting adopted a new harbours and fairways act'9which, subject to application, permits autonomous coastal shipping: such permission allows sailing in specific fairways subject to compulsory pilotage or in areas where no pilotage services are provided. where pilot projects depart from applicable laws and regulations, they can be conducted with statutory authority in special laws, as in the examples mentioned, or in the pilot schemes in public administration act: under the pilot schemes, public administration can apply to the ministry of local government and modernisation to depart from laws and regulations in order to test new ways of organising their activities or performing their tasks for a period of up to four years in the white paper on innovation in the public sector we will consider whether the pilot schemes allows sufficient scope to test new solutions based on ai: lov---- lov om utproving av selvkjorende kjoretoy [act relating to testing self-driving vehicles] sjofartsdirektoratet (): horten blir testomrade for autonome skip [norwegian maritime authority (): horten to be test bed for autonomous ships]  www sdir no/enl lov---- lov om havner 0g farvann (havne- 0g farvannsloven)  [act relating to harbours and fairways, section ] 



investment in autonomous ships the norwegian shipping industry is at the forefront of developing and exploiting new technologies. norway will have the world's first commercially operated autonomous ship: yara birkeland. on commission from yara, the kongsberg group is supplying equipment for the world's first electric, zero-emissions, autonomous container ship the ship will transport fertiliser from yara's factory on heroya to the ports of brevik and larvik the ship, which is due to be delivered in , will gradually move from manned operation to fully autonomous operation with remote monitoring in . the ship will replace a substantial volume of road haulage (estimated at , truck journeys annually), emit fewer greenhouse gas emissions, improve local air quality and produce less noise. in addition, norgesgruppen (asko) has received funds from enova (nok  million) to establish an autonomous transport chain across the oslo fjord, between moss and holmestrand: two sea drones will then replace  daily (approximately , annual) truck journeys between ostfold and vestfold. these all-electric, autonomous transport ferries are scheduled for commission in . sources: norwegian maritime authority/yara and enova the government will establish a regulatory sandbox for data protection under the remit ofthe norwegian data protection authority: this will fulfil several purposes: enterprises can a better understanding of the regulatory requirements placed on data protection and reduce the time from development and testing to actually rolling out al solutions to the market: systems that are rolled out after being developed in the sandbox can serve as leading examples, and can help other enterprises that are interested in developing similar systems: the authorities can a better understanding of new technological solutions and more easily identify potential risks and problems at an early stage so that guidance material can be produced to clarify how the regulations should be applied. the authorities and industries can identify sectors with a need for their own industry standards. individuals and society as a whole will benefit from new and innovative solutions being developed within responsible parameters. the government is positive towards developing new regulatory sandboxes in different areas responsibility for such regulatory sandboxes ought to lie with the communities best qualified to test new systems in some areas, such as further development of smart cities and autonomous transport systems, it may be natural for this respon- sibility to lie with local and regional authorities or other enterprises communities.  gain gain



the information commissioner's office's regulatory sandbox the information commissioner's office (ico) in the uk is testing a regulatory sandbox designed to support development of products and services that are innovative and widely beneficial: organisations can have the way use personal data in their systems reviewed and assessed. ico can provide some comfort from enforcement action during the testing and development phases of their systems ico wants to work on products and services that are at the cutting edge of development and that operate in areas where there is genuine uncertainty about how regulations should be interpreted. following an open application process, the ico selected  organisations of varying types and sizes and from different sectors to be provided with free, professional guidance from ico staff. one of the successful applicants is heathrow airport's project to assess whether facial recognition technology can be used for checking in, security checks, self-service drops, etc to create a frictionless journey through the airport another project selected comes from trustelevate, which is developing a model using al for age-checking children and young people under  in connection with accessing social media. source: the norwegian data protection authority public administration act and archival act the reports published by the law commission on the archival act2o and by the law commission on the public administration act2i will both have a bearing on public- sector administrative proceedings and on the use of al in public administration. administrative proceedings in the public sector are highly regulated, though some degree of discretionary assessment may be exercised in the process. this means that a system does not have to be either manual or automated. it can have solutions where only exceptional cases are processed manually or have processes where an executive officer must examine certain points in order to make an assessment; but where the rest of the process is automated and rule-based: many public-sector administrative proceedings are already automated: there are case management systems with integrated application dialogue making it possible to make automated decisions immediately: feature common to all of the current automated case management systems is that they are rule-based. the regulations are programmed into the solution, making it possible to give reasons for the decisions made: the public administration act requires grounds to be given for all decisions affecting individuals. this obligation to state grounds is important for safeguarding citizens' opportunities to verify and check decisions made concerning them.  nou :  fra kalveskinn til datasjo ny lov om samfunnsdokumentasjon 0g arkiver [official norwegian report on a new archival act] nou :  ny forvaltningslov lov om saksbehandlingen offentlig forvaltning (forvaltningsloven) [official norwegian report on a new public administration act]  they bag



nou :  ny forvaltningslov [new public administration administration act] the law commission on the public administration act was appointed in  and submitted its report in the spring of .a central element in the commission's mandate was 'to draft an act that facilitates and builds on the fact that most administrative proceedings are performed, or will be performed, digitally' . the commission points out that automated decision-making can generate substantial efficiency gains, particularly where case volumes are large. auto- mation can also promote equal treatment; given that everyone who is in the same situation, according to the system criteria, is automatically treated equally: automation enables consistent implementation of regulations and can prevent unequal practice: automated administrative proceedings can also enhance implementation of rights and obligations; for example; by automatically making decisions that grant benefits when the conditions are met: this can particularly benefit the most disadvantaged in society: more consistent implementation of obligations can lead to higher levels of compliance and to a perception among citizens that most people contribute their share; which in turn can help build trust wherever there is a need to exercise discretion, rule-based systems can filter out cases or checkpoints for manual assessment: the commission points out that machine learning can offer new possibilities for automating assessment criteria: the majority of the commission proposes that statutory authority be provided in the regulations to allow administrative bodies in specific areas to make decisions using fully automated administrative proceedings. decisions with a low impact on individuals may be made without providing statutory authority in regulations. the commission also proposes that the administrative body must document the legal content of automated decision-making systems. such information should be made public unless laws, regulations or special considerations dictate otherwise. the law commission on the public administration act sees the difficulty in implementing cohesive services without sharing data across agencies. the absence of authority to share information can make it difficult to organise the public administration appropriately, and prevent full automation of administrative proceedings in areas that lend themselves to this the commission therefore proposes that authority be given to share confidential information with other administrative bodies on a need-to-know basis. this constitutes a broader application than current laws: source: nou :  ny forvaltningslov lov om saksbehandlingen offentlig forvaltning (forvaltningsloven) there is huge potential to increase the use of artificial intelligence in public-sector administrative proceedings in the form of both rule-based systems and machine learning: the law commission on the public administration act emphasizes that automation can promote equal treatment and consistent implementation of regulations nonetheless, when case management systems containing al elements are implemented; the algorithm's judgement must be at least as sound and as trustworthy 



as the human discretion it replaces. to ensure this, we need systems that are transparent and explainable: in its report; the law commission on the archival act points to the importance of ensuring that al-driven processes and decisions are documented and that the documentation is protected in ways that render it authentic and usable: existing archiving procedures, archiving systems and archiving institutions in the public sector are currently not equipped to address this challenge: the commission therefore recommends that consideration be given to how archiving functionality can be built into the administrative processes and to identify any specific aspects resulting from the use of artificial intelligence. artificial intelligence can also be used to achieve better, more efficient classification and sorting of information and thereby simplify and improve record-keeping and archiving practices in the future: the government will review and assess regulations that hamper appropriate and desired use of artificial intelligence in the public and private sectors set requirements for transparency and accountability in new public administration systems in which al is part of the solution establish an advisory body and a regulatory sandbox in the area of privacy and data protection be receptive to requests from public and private enterprises to establish more regulatory sandboxes establish a health analysis platform to streamline and simplify access to health data for research and analysis and simultaneously strengthen privacy and data protection facilitate more active use of health data for testing the effects and safety of medicines and medical technology



. infrastructure: networks and computing power deployment of the electronic communication networks the electronic communication networks, and the mobile communication networks in particular, are a cornerstone in the digital transformation of society: norway has a well-developed fourth-generation (4g) mobile network with excellent coverage. there are plans to deploy a nationwide 5g network in the norwegian mobile market by . this will be important for leveraging the opportunities that lie in  technology and  networks, not least as an underlying technology for the internet of things (lot) lot is a term often used to refer to the ever increasing amount of sensors connected to the internet: it can cover everything from mobile phones and private smart home solutions to sensors measuring air pollution, water quality, noise levels, and so on: the data can be used in predictive maintenance; decision processes and development of new business models. iot solutions are already deployed in today's 4g networks, but because 5g is faster than 4g, has better capacity and detect weaker signals, it will play a significant role in the development of lot. better capacity is particularly important in densely populated areas 5g infrastructure will therefore be important for implementing a full-scale realisation of lot with a capacity that cannot be delivered by today's technology: this will enable completely new applications in different sectors of society, such as transport; health and care; and smart cities. the mobile networks will be a vital enabling technology for al, due not only to their role as a communication infrastructure but also to the vast amount of communication data generated by producing the services. anonymised metadata from the mobile networks can be used as input in systems that use al for analysis, improving the underlying data for decision-support; and processes controls. such data is already commercially available from mobile network operators (telenor, telia and ice): use of such data falls under a range of regulations, both sectoral laws and the personal data act: the government will monitor developments in this area and consider how to facilitate more use of this data in the transport sector, deployment of the electronic communication networks, expansion of lot technology and access to anonymised metadata from communication will represent elements in leveraging the opportunities that lie in al, such as: self-driving and autonomous cars, buses, trucks, drones, trains and ships intelligent traffic management; controlling and influencing behaviour in traffic early warning of the need to make replacements and maintain infrastructure prediction of travel behaviour more advanced route optimisation  telia (): telia skal bygge ut et nasjonal -nett lopet av  [telia to deploy a national  network by the end of ]. press release,  october   key



transport and communication infrastructure is also a key element in the development of smart cities and municipalities. smart city solutions such as personalised health services, smart energy supply, and building management systems based on big data and al will depend on fast and robust electronic communication networks: the government wants to accelerate the pace of further broadband deployment the draft legislation on broadband deployment includes measures to facilitate the common use of existing physical infrastructure; measures to ensure that developers of mobile and broadband networks receive information on, and can participate in, ongoing and planned building and construction projects; and measures to ensure that developers receive information on existing physical infrastructure: the new act will require new buildings and buildings that undergo renovation to be made ready to connect to high-speed networks. the government will present a white paper on electronic communication. high-performance computing (hpc) the amount of data in many areas of research and public administration is growing rapidly: in addition to experiments and theory development; calculations and data- driven research have become important work methods for researchers this creates a growing need not only for storing and accessing data, but also for the computing power to process the data: scientific calculations make it possible to analyse and identify new theoretical relationships in the vast datasets generated by, for example, genetic sequencing; satellite observations or research vessels. many research projects that process large datasets can use local resources or capacity from one of the large cloud service providers. if the chosen provider stores and processes data in compliance with the general data protection regulation, most unclassified data can be processed in cloud services: use of cloud services from large commercial players like google, amazon and microsoft offer more capacity (for storage and computing power) and various commercially available analytical tools. however, these services are often insufficient for processing larger datasets or data requiring large-scale parallel calculations. such situations call for larger computing resources, which are more cost-effective to establish at national or international level. uninett as develops and operates norway's high-speed research and education network: uninett's subsidiary, uninett sigma2, is responsible for procuring; operating and maintaining national resources for hpc and data storage in norway: for some research areas, such as astrophysics and marine research, the datasets are s large and require such high computing speeds that our national resources lack the necessary capacity. we are dependent on cooperation and on buying capacity in international consortia. such high-performance computing centres can have up to  times more capacity than the national resources: in  the european commission took the initiative to establish the european high- performance computing joint undertaking (europhc), which is jointly funded by the european commission and national contributions from  norway's continued participation in europhc will depend on norway's participation in the horizon europe framework programme and the digital europe programme (dep): uninett sigma2 is norway's national competence centre for high-performance computing in the eurohpc partnership.  buy



hpc produces vital knowledge about major societal challenges life cycle assessments and material flow analyses are key elements for gaining an overall picture of the environmental impacts of different products from cradle to grave. such analyses demand large datasets and immense computing power. combining data from the oceans with atmospheric measurements will provide a better data source for climate modelling: climate models require increasingly higher resolution in time and space, and thereby more calculations, if are to provide the necessary local insights into climate change will affect the risk of floods, land slides and extreme weather. similarly, modelling of space weather will be essential for avoiding paralysis of critical infrastructure by severe solar storms: health research has been revolutionised in recent years by genetic sequencing and advanced algorithms, which in turn have opened the door to personalised medicine and new advanced forms of treatment: these methods generate vast amounts of sensitive data that must be analysed by high-performance computers and stored in highly secure environments source: ministry of education and research some areas require high levels of cyber security while simultaneously allowing the data to be processed efficiently: relevant examples are high-resolution mr images, dna data, videos of patients and other sensitive data. solutions for storing and processing such data are mainly provided through the service for sensitive data (tsd), which is operated and developed through collaboration between the university of oslo and uninett sigma2. norwegian data centres as a resource for al cloud services are fundamental for enabling enterprises to exploit the potential of ai technology: cloud services provide access to computing power and frameworks for machine learning; which are not available locally: factors are driving the increase in data, among them lot and the possibility to perform more and increasingly advanced analyses on complex data sources. this increases the demand for storage and processing capacity 'in the cloud', which in turn increases the need to establish more data centres. the government wants norway to be perceived as an attractive host country for data centres and other data-driven industry. a national data centre strategy was published in . several measures laid out in the strategy, such as reduced electricity supply costs for data centres, removal of the 'machinery tax' and a more straightforward site zoning process for data centres, have made norway even more attractive to the data centre industry. clean energy, communications infrastructure and political and geological stability are other important arguments for choosing norway as a host country for data centres. ministry of trade, industry and fisheries (): powered by nature norway as a data centre nation. strategy  they how many - good



the number of data centres established in norway has grown in recent years many norwegian data centres have major international customers, and several large international cloud service providers have opted to establish their own data centres in norway: we are also witnessing a trend whereby customers including international companies are moving tasks that require large amounts of computing power to norwegian data centres because they can offer scalable capacity based on renewable energy: this is a positive trend from a business perspective, and provides norway's business and public sectors with a wider choice of suppliers. it is particularly important for enterprises with stringent latency requirements or that process data that needs to be stored and processed in norway due to legal requirements the national security act): the government will consider how to facilitate increased use of anonymised metadata from the mobile networks present a bill on broadband deployment that will contribute to accelerating the pace of deployment of high-speed networks in norway facilitate the rapid rollout of 5g present white paper on electronic communication consider further participation in eurohpc in connection with horizon europe and the digital europe programme (dep) establish a marketplace for cloud services which will, among other things, guide public agencies on procuring cloud services, with particular focus on security follow up the data centre strategy powered by nature strategy: norway as data centre nation (e.g:

norwegian al research consortium (nora) in  a consortium was set up aimed at strengthening norwegian research and education in artificial intelligence; machine learning; robotics and related disciplines: the consortium comprises norwegian universities and research institutions engaged in research and education in artificial intelligence: the university of agder, the arctic university of norway, oslomet; the university of bergen; the norwegian university of life sciences, simula research laboratory as, the university of stavanger, norce and the university of oslo. source: noraai biginsight statistics for the knowledge economy and sirius centre for scalable data access are centres for research-based innovation that focus on al-relevant technologies (big data and data analysis) the research council of norway is now witnessing a trend whereby most centres for research-based innovation have one or more activities related to artificial intelligence: sirius is affiliated with the bigmed project; to which the research council of norway has allocated nok  million for personalised medicine and use of large-scale data analysis in healthcare: industrial phd scheme under the industrial phd scheme; companies can get funding from the research council of norway to allow an employee to undertake a phd project in an area that is relevant to the company's activities the scheme enables companies to enhance their long-term research competence and innovation ability and to strengthen their collaborative relationship with academia. the scheme is a alternative for companies in need of targeted research activities but with no possibility or capacity to initiate large-scale randd projects. figures from the research council of norway show that artificial intelligence is the area of knowledge in ict showing the strongest growth in the industrial phd scheme. the government's ambition for norwegian al research the government considers norway to be well placed to succeed with human-friendly and trustworthy al, and with al in industrial applications norway has a technologically advanced industry with the ability and will to adopt new solutions. although large countries such as the united states and china have resources with which neither norway nor europe can compete, there are areas where norway and europe have competitive advantages, such as certain industrial applications of al and trustworthy al that takes data protection and ethical considerations into account to ensure that norway remains internationally competitive in areas where we have comparative advantages, it is important that al research is integrated with investments in these areas: as a small country, norway does not have the capability to build knowledge and expertise to high international standards across the full spectrum of al. nevertheless, the quality and scope of our national expertise must be sufficient to exploit the technologies and innovations that emerge internationally. another goal must be to  good



leverage our position as a nation with a digitally advanced population and business sector in order to take the lead in applying al, not least in industry: our national research and study programmes in artificial intelligence must hold a high international standard. artificial intelligence falls under one of the five long-term priorities in the government's long-term plan for research and higher education: enabling and industrial technologies. the government is increasing allocations to this priority area through, among other things, the technology initiative escalation plan, which is one of the stated measures in the long-term plan: private investments in al research wallenberg al, autonomous systems and software program (wasp) wallenberg al, autonomous systems and software program (wasp) is a swedish research institution funded by the knut and alice wallenberg foundation. wasp cooperates with sweden's five leading ict universities wasp focuses on two areas in al: the main focus area covers machine learning; deep learning and next- generation al (explainable al) and the other focus area is the mathematical foundations of al: wasp also aims to recruit outstanding international researchers and to enhance competence in sweden and in swedish industry by training at least  new phd candidates, of which at least  should be industrial phd candidates. wasp has a budget of sek  billion up to and including . norwegian open al lab the telenor-ntnu al lab was established at the norwegian university of science and technology (ntnu) in  after telenor donated approximately nok  million: the donation was made to help boost research, innovation and education in artificial intelligence; machine learning; big data analysis and iot in norway: in  several business partners were included in the cooperation project; and the research centre changed its name to the norwegian open al lab. the new partners dnb, dnv gl, equinor and kongsberg have donated funds towards general research at ntnu and to research where al is a central component the contributions from industry are donated primarily to fund researcher positions and professorships but also physical facilities and equipment that can be used by both researchers and students. these types of donations from industry strengthen relationships between the partner companies and the university: the connection to industry forms a better platform for exploiting the opportunities that lie in artificial intelligence: this form of cooperation will, among other things, give students and researchers opportunities to work on authentic problems and datasets from industry, contributing to innovation and moving the frontier of al research forward cooperation is continually being expanded to include new cooperation partners from research and industry: sources: www wasp-swedenorg and norwegian open al lab 



it is also important that norwegian research communities take full advantage of the opportunities offered by the eu framework programme, and that we leverage the opportunities that lie in our bilateral research and technology agreements with strong academic communities in leading research nations worldwide: norway must be a trustworthy and attractive partner in international cooperation, networks and consortia dealing with research and education in artificial intelligence: key research policy objective is to stimulate private investment in research. this includes stimulating private individuals and organisations to make donations to research. there are general policy instruments to support this: under the gift reinforcement programme, donations of at least nok  million made to long-term, basic research can trigger a gift reinforcement from the state worth  per cent of the donated amount: this programme is administered by the research council of norway: the norwegian tax administration has a scheme under which deductions from taxable income may be granted for monetary donations made towards scientific research conducted by pre-approved organisations participation in eu programmes norway has actively participated in the eu's framework programmes for research and innovation for many decades the research council of norway's policy instruments should be designed in such a way that they stimulate and qualify for participation in the eu programmes artificial intelligence and high-performance computing are areas where we are dependent on international cooperation. al is included in several calls for proposals in horizon , and will have an even more prominent place in the next eu framework programme; horizon europe investment in innovation will also be strengthened compared with the current period. the eu has proposed establishing a comprehensive digitalisation programme; digital europe programme (dep) for the period -. this is the first time the eu has proposed a programme dedicated specifically to digitalisation. the programme has a proposed budget of eur . billion divided into five main areas: high-performance computing, artificial intelligence; cyber security, digital transformation and interoperability, and advanced digital skills. dep is a core element in the european commission's efforts in digital transformation: the programme targets areas where individual countries alone lack the necessary resources to succeed. the resources in the programme will be used in areas where they are expected to be most effective, such as health, justice, consumer protection and public administration. the programme also aims to help small and medium-sized enterprises to adapt to changes brought about by digitalisation and artificial intelligence: norway has made a non-binding declaration of intent to participate in the next programme period for the research and innovation framework programme, horizon europe. this will give us the opportunity to participate in the strategic planning process. the government is considering norways possible participation in dep. report to the storting no_  (-) long-term plan for research and higher education and the granavolden platform of  january

subjects that can be classified as artificial intelligence are part of several study programmes, but are most common in programmes in information technology and cyberneticsrobotics. in these programmes at both bachelor and master level students may, to varying extents, choose courses in al or decide to specialise in al by both choosing al-relevant subjects and writing their bachelor or master's thesis in that subject area: typical subjects in these types of study programmes are: algorithms, machine learning, computer vision, deep learning and big data analysis. some educational institutions also offer dedicated programmes in al, but up to now these programmes could offer relatively few study places since , however, we see that a growing number of educational institutions are offering separate programmes in al at both bachelor and master level. institutions already offering such programmes are expanding the number of study places more than  new study places dedicated to al, robotics and data science are planned from , compared to . more than  master degree candidates with a clear al profile are estimated to have graduated every year from  to . these were candidates from study programmes dedicated to al and candidates whose choice of course and thesis define them as 'al candidates'.  the majority of these students graduated from the university of oslo and ntnu. in addition, just over  bachelor candidates graduate every year with al profiles some of them pursue master programmes in the same subject area: informal learning arenas: eik ideverksted eik ideverksted is a makerspace for technological innovation: the makerspace is a cooperation project between the norwegian university of life sciences (nmbu), inkubator as, the savings bank foundation dnb and the sparebank foundation: eik ideverksted offers a range of courses, workshops, seminars and projects to students and employees at nmbu. the aim is to serve as an active meeting place that is open to the academic, student; local and business communities: many of the students who participate in eik ideverksted learn to use al tools at quite advanced levels, even though they do not necessarily have the same in- depth knowledge and academic background as students taking formal courses in ai. al is becoming increasingly accessible because companies like google and facebook offer low-threshold tools in areas such as image processing, natural language processing; prediction, and so on; sources: norwegian university of life sciences (nmbu), eikide_org data on, among other things, the number of students and the number of candidates which the institutions report to the database for statistics on higher education are not tagged to such a level of detail as to enable retrieval of reliable figures on programmes in al. to gain picture of the current situation, the ministry of local government and modernisation therefore asked the educational institutions to count the number of candidates who graduated from study programmes in al and the number of candidates with an 'al profile'. the enquiry regarding the numbers of study places and graduated candidates in al was sent to all the universities as well as to ostfold university western norway university of applied sciences, inland norway university of applied sciences, and kristiania university college. all of them submitted reports_ as well as reporting the number of study places and the number of candidates who took examinations at bachelor, master and phd levels in al, they also reported on new study programmes in al and on increases in the number of study places in existing al programmes_ the institutions may have used different definitions of what constitutes an 'al profile' or an 'al programme"" and thus which candidates were counted.  college,



development of study programmes in al the faculty of mathematics and natural sciences at the university of oslo hosts a centre of excellence; the centre for computing in science education (csse) which makes an important contribution to further developing study programmes in al. the faculty, through ccse and the centre for teaching and learning in science and technology (kurt) offers comprehensive continuing education to schoolteachers in order to integrate programming into school subjects. this is done through the profag programming course for schoolteachers what subjects are taught in schools is key factor in raising the level of higher education in artificial intelligence, including machine learning; robotics and data science: source: university of oslo the number of phd degrees in topics that can be defined as artificial intelligence is also steadily growing: moreover, methods from artificial intelligence are increasingly used as tools by phd candidates and researchers in other areas as well as seeking candidates with specific training in al and data science; business and industry is also interested in candidates with sound knowledge in information technology, mathematics and statistics. candidates like these will possess the necessary prerequisites for understanding and learning more about al, either through formal education or through training in the workplace need for interdisciplinarity knowledge of artificial intelligence, and related fields such as ethics and data protection associated with al applications, will be important in study programmes oriented towards the educational sector, health, crime prevention, law and several other fields. for example, an introductory course in artificial intelligence has been established at the university of bergen, in which students of medicine and bioengineering learn about how al can be used in clinical practice: one of the aims is to promote interdisciplinary cooperation between physicians and engineers. the universities of bergen and oslo also offer courses in artificial intelligence and machine learning oriented towards social scientists: institutions of higher education ought to evaluate how topics with relevance to artificial intelligence can be integrated into their programmes in areas that will be affected by artificial intelligence in the coming years. need for knowledge about study programmes with relevance to artificial intelligence during the work on preparing this strategy, it has become clear that official statistics on higher education are not sufficiently detailed to provide reliable information about the scope of the different study programmes needed to succeed with artificial intelligence in norway: this knowledge base must therefore be strengthened. the eu is also working on models that can produce better knowledge on this issue, based on official statistics and existing databases norway is engaged in this work, and will evaluate whether new measurements can be based on these models.

. skills the government wants digital skills and technology literacy to be given more prominence already at primary and lower secondary school level: under the curriculum renewal; natural science will be made a more exploratory and practical subject already at primary school level, with a distinct technology element that also includes programming: programming will be introduced in more subjects; among other things, programming and computational thinking skills will be included in the new mathematics subject. the new curricula will come into effect in . it will take a long time before the children starting school in the autumn of  complete their education and are ready to start work or take further studies, perhaps in technology or artificial intelligence. in the meantime there will be a need to manage the new skill requirements expected of today's adult population in both their private and working lives. courses and further education programmes an analysis from  estimated a high probability that  per cent of jobs in norway would be automated over the next  years these figures have subsequently been modified, and a  report from the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) estimated that only  per cent of jobs in norway were at risk of automation. this figure is the lowest of all oecd member countries: it also emerged that norwegian employees both those with and those without higher education were among those who receive most training in the workplace. nav's horizon scan29 deals with the most important societal trends that will affect the future labour market it shows that the pace of change in the labour market will accelerate. oecd estimates that every fourth job will undergo major changes technological developments will likely lead to many new jobs, but will just as likely lead to employees having to change jobs, change the formal relationship they have with employers, and their skills more often. opportunities for upskilling and reskilling both in the workplace and through study programmes will therefore become increasingly important: development and use of artificial intelligence make up part of this picture: like elsewhere, technological developments in artificial intelligence are bringing about changes in many jobs; some work tasks will disappear, while tasks that require other skill types will emerge. meanwhile, ever fewer jobs will require little or no formal skills. the government considers it important that people who already have jobs be given opportunities to take courses and further education. in  the government will present a white paper on a skills reform for lifelong learning (laere hele livet). the objectives of the skills reform are that no one should be left behind and that more employees should remain longer in their jobs: the curriculum renewal refers to the work on renewing all the curricula in primary and lower secondary education and in upper secondary education. the new curricula will come into effect at the start of the school year in  nedelkoska, l. and quintini, g.

al for everyone: elements of al elements of al is a series of free online courses in artificial intelligence. the course was developed in the spring of  by the finnish company reaktor, its norwegian sister company feed and the university of helsinki: the aim of the course is to teach as many as possible about what a is, what it can and cannot be used for, and how to start using methods based on al. the course combines theory with practical exercises, and requires no prior knowledge elements of al has quickly become extremely popular, and ranks top in several overviews of massive open online courses (moocs) eighteen months after it was launched, more than , people had registered to take the course; of which  to  per cent have completed all the modules: the course has attracted much larger proportions of female students ( per cent) and students aged over  ( per cent) than is normally the case for ict courses in sweden and finland the proportion of female students taking the course is more than  per cent: since elements of al was launched, the university of helsinki, which is the host university, has seen increases in the number of ordinary applicants to ict programmes and in the proportion of female applicants. key factor in motivating people to complete the course is the #aichallenge: the #aichallenge encourages companies and public agencies to commit to supporting their employees to complete elements of ai. by the autumn of  more than  finnish and swedish organisations had taken up the challenge, among them telia, nokia, systembolaget; nordea, bonnier, swedish tax agency and volvo. elements of al will be launched in norwegian in cooperation with ntnu in . source: feed/reaktor employers must ensure that their employees possess the necessary skills. this includes assessing the need for continuing and further education. individual employees must also take responsibility for their own skills development in a labour market with ever increasing requirements. nonetheless, some skill needs may not be met; and the public sector ought to find new ways of addressing these: to help enterprises meet new skill needs that arise, the government has established a range of schemes that support the development and operation of flexible further education programmes several programmes in digital skills have already been established as a result of cooperation between universities, university colleges or tertiary vocational colleges and the labour market the idea is to enable people to undertake this type of further education while they are employed. from  the government will reinforce these efforts through a new skills programme and through increased allocations to a competition-based scheme administered by the norwegian agency for international cooperation and quality enhancement in higher education (diku): the target group for the programmes developed with funding from these schemes are employees who need new skills due to restructuring needs created by digitalisation and the transition to a green society: 



workplace training norway has positive experiences with handling restructuring in the labour market due various changes. norwegian employees are at adapting, and cooperation between employee organisations, employer organisations and the authorities is good: this may be one of the reasons why norwegian employee organisations tend to seek dialogue on how employees and employers can work together to meet the coming challenges rather than focus their concerns on the potential negative consequences of al for jobs and work tasks. several large enterprises have launched their own further education programmes in al and data analysis for example, dnb bank has offered its employees opportunities to train as data scientists in order to meet the bank's need for competence in this area. the government is also cooperating with the employee and employer organisations on an industry programme for the municipal care sector and an industry programme for industry and construction: the costs of the industry programmes are shared among the state, which pays for developing and operating the programmes; the enterprises, which invest their own resources; and the employees, who invest some of their free time. the industry programmes will also be included in the skills programme in , and work on the programmes will be strengthened and further developed in cooperation between the partners. norwegian state educational loan fund: testing al as training measure when the norwegian state educational loan fund (lanekassen) was introducing a new collaboration platform in ,it wanted to find out whether an al chatbot could make training users of the platform more effective: lanekassen decided to use a technology supplied by the norwegian company boost.ai, a market leader in conversational ai. because testing the chatbot involved all lanekassen employees, all gained insight into what a chatbot is and how it is trained: after two weeks, lanekassen's employees had performed close to , chats with the robot: the system made an important contribution to the launch of the collaboration platform, as well as illustrating how use of al created an opportunity to involve a whole organisation: this measure is an example of successful public - private cooperation on new technology and modern development methodology: the test project has also provided experience transfer for other public agencies such as vy, nav and the norwegian government agency for financial management (dfo): source: lanekassen (): sluttrapport fra konseptutreding av muligheter for effektivisering ved bruk av kunstig intelligens [norwegian state educational loan fund (): final report from the concept study of the rationalisation potential of ai]  nav (): nav's horizon scan  developments, trends and consequences towards  _ report   good to they using

the government wants norway to take a leading position in exploiting the innovation potential in applying artificial intelligence. the government will evaluate how industrial policy instruments can best <aerial bipedw, azumi maekawa (p) be designed to support potential value creation and use of al in the and shunji yamanaka (p) business sector: photo: ars electronica public agencies ought to actively explore the potential of the technology, and increased interaction between the sector and the business sector should promote innovation and value creation:  enhancing innovation capacity using al norway can take a leading position in applying artificial intelligence, particularly in areas where we already are well positioned and have strong business and research communities, such as health, oil and gas, energy, the maritime and marine industries and the public sector. the foundation we lay in the form of access to good infrastructure, data sharing; research and competence building will also provide a starting point for increased innovation and value creation for small but technologically advanced companies. the largest public agencies already serve as a driving force in al by actively exploring the potential that lies in this technology: the government facilitate sharing of best practice across sectors and enterprises. increased interaction and cooperation between the public and business sectors, and between research communities and the business sector, are vital to unlocking the innovative potential of applying artificial intelligence in the form of both established and new models of cooperation.  public good will



the public sector ought to actively explore opportunities in the market in connection with procurements, and innovative public procurements should be used wherever appropriate: to facilitate innovative solutions, agencies ought to focus on their needs rather than on specific products or services . industrial policy instruments the authorities play an important role in facilitating business development; also with regard to al. however, the business sector also has a responsibility to develop and adopt technologies that can create better, more profitable services or more efficient operations. the underlying assumption is that companies and enterprises invest less in research and development than what is profitable for society as a whole. as part of norway's research and innovation system, public authorities therefore facilitate innovation through grants and other schemes administered by the system of policy instruments for research and innovation. several policy instruments currently available promote research in, and development; testing and commercialisation of, artificial intelligence: support for the early phase, where more emphasis is placed on research and research- based innovation, is usually provided through the research council of norway: innovation norway has a responsibility to promote innovation, value creation and growth in business and industry through, among other things, financial contributions and expertise. in recent years innovation norway has arranged the tech city executive accelerator (tea) initiative for companies oriented towards al and iot. the aim is to make executives in expanding norwegian companies aware of the opportunities for leveraging al and iot. tea is based in london: the industrial development corporation of norway (siva) facilitates innovation through infrastructure such as business gardens, incubators and initiatives such as the norwegian catapult scheme. investinor is a state-owned venture investment company whose purpose is to improve access to capital in the early-stage market (the market for investment capital for companies in the process of developing new products or processes): export credit and guarantee schemes help norwegian businesses enhance their competitiveness in the international market innovation project: machine learning in seismology earth science analytics as leads an industry innovation project that receives funding via the research council of norway's petromaks  programme machine learning in geoscience: the project shows how digitalisation and artificial intelligence are in the process of transforming the seismic industry: today geologists spend around  per cent of their time on seismic interpretation. artificial intelligence could automate some parts of the interpretation process. this would make retrieving relevant information from seismic data far easier and more efficient: the technology can also be combined with tools for analysing well data. this will help the oil companies make better decisions based on large amounts of reliable data: source: ministry of petroleum and energy 



digital21 digital21 is a strategy developed by and for businesses the goal has been to make recommendations to the authorities on how businesses can better develop and benefit from competence; technology, research and development in order to succeed in digitalisation. an important message in the strategy is that norway cannot be best at everything, and should therefore give priority to the technology areas where norwegian business and industry can most: digital21 highlights artificial intelligence, big data, the internet of things and autonomous systems as particularly important technologies for norway in the time ahead. source: digital2lno some countries have introduced grant schemes for businesses that start up al projects. in sweden; for example; vinnova has established a scheme to which companies and public enterprises can apply for grants of up to sek , to start up their first al project: norway has no schemes specifically for randd in al; instead we have a broader scheme, skattefunn; through which norwegian companies can apply for tax deductions on randd costs. skattefunn is a rights-based scheme with simple application processes and reporting requirements: forskerpool [researcher pool] is a scheme affiliated to skattefunn to which businesses can apply for up to  hours of assistance from a researcher to develop an idea or get feedback on a problem: this scheme may be particularly relevant for smes, which often lack this type of in-house expertise. in al, where there is a shortage of personnel with advanced skills, schemes like these where resources are shared can more companies gain access to the expertise they need to start their projects or pilots. business clusters represent a policy instrument that can be suitable for promoting business development in al: innovation norway, the research council of norway, and siva currently fund a cluster programme: the business community takes on the roles of leading and coordinating the business clusters, but research institutions and public agencies are often members: cluster for applied ai in halden, esmart systems, the institute for energy technology (ife), ostfold university college and the research and innovation company smart innovation norway have taken the initiative to develop a new cluster, the cluster for applied al. the ambition is to create an optimal platform for developing norwegian companies' international competitiveness and sustainable social development through applied al. the purpose of the cluster is to create new jobs and sustainable development based on rapid development and application of ai. focus areas will be technological development; commercialisation, ethics, security and accessibility. the cluster will facilitate the sharing of data, infrastructure and other technologies that its members would otherwise be unable to invest in source: smart innovation norway  profit help key



digitalnorway digitalnorway is non-profit organisation whose mission is to make it easier for norwegian businesses to succeed with digitalisation. digitalnorway cooperates with research and educational institutions, business clusters and several of norway's best competence and innovation communities. among other things, the organisation provides tools for companies that want to make the transition from idea to product or service, and networks for sharing knowledge and experiences the conversion engine service helps companies build their in-house expertise in digitalisation and advanced production. together with smart innovation norway, nce ikuben and nce kongsberg innovasjon, digitalnorway leads the work on the conversion engine for digitalisation while nce raufoss has corresponding responsibility for manufacturing/advanced production: the aim is to help small and medium-sized enterprises throughout the country succeed in their digital transformation. innovation norway supports the programme. source: digitalnorway there are also good examples of the business sector launching its own initiatives measures such as the al village in trondheim, where several companies have joined forces to leverage synergies and create a stronger community, are examples of how cooperation within the business sector can produce positive effects. review of the system of policy instruments in  the government launched a comprehensive review of the system of business policy instruments. the purpose is for norway to derive maximum value creation and economically sustainable jobs within sustainable parameters from the resources that are channelled through the system of policy instruments. eu policy instruments for al targeting smes: digital innovation hubs digital innovation hubs (dihs) is a policy instrument that was launched by the european commission in  to help small and medium-sized enterprises (smes) to digitalise faster. the first generation of dihs was created under horizon . four norwegian dihs have been set up, affiliated with gce node in agder, sintef, oslo cancer cluster and digital norway, all of which are active enablers for smes: in the transition to the new eu programmes for -, a new generation of larger and more binding dihs will be introduced: these will be one-stop shops, and will cover an ecosystem (national and international) that can offer expertise and competence and contribute to enabling smes in particular to become digital and leverage the potential of artificial intelligence. funding for the projects will come from the digital europe programme, among others: the dih programme and norway's catapult scheme share some common features the government has established norwegian catapult; a scheme that gives norwegian industry access to test facilities in order to enhance innovation and value creation: updated information on the review of the system of business-oriented policy instruments is available (in norwegian) at wwwregjeringen nolvmg  good



nok  million was allocated to the scheme in the  national budget siva has given priority to further developing the catapult scheme in ,in cooperation with innovation norway and the research council of norway: in norway the clusters will be participants in the dihs that are set up. one important task for the system of policy instruments will be to further develop complementarity between the hubs, the cluster programme and the catapult scheme intellectual property rights protecting intellectual property rights is important for ensuring that the al market develops in the right way: uncertainty about ownership of the various elements that make up solutions based on al (data, development framework, pre-trained algorithms; etc.), how are licensed or how access to the solutions is paid for, will have negative impacts. the government wants norwegian companies to make informed and competent decisions regarding protection, use and enforcement of their intellectual assets and rights, and to have a professional and conscious approach to the way they handle the rights of others. norwegian companies should secure the increased market access and value creation which professional protection and use of copyright law can afford them. protecting their ownership rights can be particularly decisive in connection with internationalisation: the ministry of trade, industry and fisheries has begun mapping competence levels and needs in the area of intellectual property rights in norwegian industry, and will assess whether the guidance offered on the system of policy instruments is adequate. public agencies can find it particularly difficult to know to deal with rights when development of an al-based solution is conducted through cooperation between the public sector and a private company: for example; how should a public agency handle ownership and user rights in a partnership where a commercial party develops and trains algorithms the public agency's data? this type of issue will likely arise in the future, and perhaps especially so in connection with using health data for commercial purposes. one important exception here, of course, is open data, which may freely be used by both commercial and public actors, pursuant to the norwegian licence for open government data (nlod) or under a creative commons licence: google deepmind and the national health service (nhs) in the uk in the uk the national health service (moorfields eye hospital nhs trust) has cooperated with google deepmind on developing an algorithm that can identify eye diseases based on images of the eye. the agreement makes deepmind the owner of the final system but entitles moorfields to the right to use it free of charge for a given number of years after it is approved for clinical use. source: moorfields eye hospital nhs trust  key any they how using



standardisation norway can contribute to ensuring that artificial intelligence develops in the desired direction by exerting influence on international standards related to al: such influence is exerted by participating in international standardisation activities and by chairing working groups in areas that are important for us at global level, al activities are conducted in the standardisation organisations iso and eic and at european level in cen and cenelec. it is most often the large companies that take an active part in standardisation activities the threshold for participating in this type of activity can be high for many smes for various reasons, such as travel costs or the time involved: standard norway has created a mirror committee (sn/k  kunstig intelligens) to follow up international standardisation activities in al. the committee is composed of representatives from research; business and industry, national authorities and various interest organisations. the government will work towards enabling the digital innovation hubs to help smes get started on applying ai engage in dialogue with digital norway on how it can enable smes to take more advantage of the potential of al promote the work on international standardisation activities related to al, particularly with regard to stimulating smes to participate in these activities develop guidelines, including proposals for standard agreement clauses, on how public agencies should deal with ownership rights when cooperating with the business sector on developing artificial intelligence



. al-based innovation in the public sector the government believes there is vast potential for the public sector to rationalise and create better services through digitalisation: artificial intelligence is one aspect of this. in the future the public sector will use artificial intelligence to deliver more targeted and user-adapted services, enhance the social benefit of its own activities, rationalise operations and work processes, and reduce risk artificial intelligence in the public sector can contribute to: more relevant advice and services to citizens in different situations in life better decision-making support for public-sector employees rationalising processes and optimising resource utilisation improving the quality of processes and services by automatically detecting possible deviations predicting trends based on data from both agencies and their environments natural language processing for sorting and categorising, and for translating between different languages and language forms use of al in the public sector is still in an early phase; however a survey32 shows that many agencies are still in the planning or testing phase; where they try to find out what al can be used for. some agencies have begun testing through proofs of concepts. the survey shows that more than half ofthe agencies regards organisational culture, legal and regulatory issues, and data protection and security as the major challenges with respect to al: lack of competence is highlighted as another challenge for example, agencies can find it difficult to assess which areas are suitable for al. one area that raises several dilemmas is the use of al for control purposes such controls can involve, for example; identifying individuals who may be violating regulations (that is to say where an algorithm identifies a high probability for this) for applications like these; consideration must be given to rule of law and protection against self-incrimi- nation for individuals subjected to regulatory checks the risk and consequences of false positives i.e,, of someone wrongly identified and of the undue hardship this would impose on them must be part of a data protection impact assessment; which must be included when a solution is under evaluation: such assessments related to the use of al in public administration can prove challenging, particularly if the agency lacks the relevant in-house expertise: uncertainty over regulations for processing personal data, relevance to the public administration act or assessments of when it is acceptable to use al may make agencies unduly reticent: this may deprive the public sector of important opportunities to improve its services or rationalise its processes: the government will therefore ask the norwegian digitalisation agency to prepare guidance on this matter, in cooperation with the norwegian data protection authority:  broomfield, heather and reutter, lisa (): kunstig intelligens/data science: en kartlegging av status, utfordringer 0g behov i norsk offentlig sektor forste resultater. [artifical intelligenceldata science: mapping of status, challenges and needs in norway's public sector. initial results]: september   being



projects using al in administration the government wants public sector organisations to facilitate experimenting with artificial intelligence to gain knowledge about and experience in the technology: trial projects or pilots in al will provide valuable experience that can be used when evaluating large-scale projects and can enhance understanding of the technology at all levels in the organisation: artificial intelligence is one of many important tools for developing sustainable public administration in both central government and the municipal sector. cooperation and exchange of best practice across organisations will contribute to better insights into al, and experiences gained by the large agencies, which often have their own it and analysis units, can help smaller organisations get started on al projects. the municipal sector is in a unique position when it comes to potential cooperation, because all municipalities have an obligation to provide the same services to their inhabitants, which means they hold datasets covering the same areas. the possibility to share best practice and to cooperate on procurements and training measures may therefore be particularly important for the municipalities: cooperation on data, algorithms and competence in al may also create possibilities to see interrelationships across sectors_ examples of projects using al in the public sector several public agencies have conducted projects in which they have used artificial intelligence: artificial intelligence in residence verification the norwegian state educational loan fund (lanekassen) has conducted a project using artificial intelligence to select students for residence verification. in  lanekassen's residential verification process covered , students, of which , were selected using artificial intelligence (machine learning) and , were selected randomly (control group): the results showed that the selection made using machine learning was twice as effective at identifying students who had not documented previously submitted residence information compared to the control group. automatic posting of invoices customers of the norwegian government agency for financial management (dfo) spend considerable time and resources on posting incoming invoices due to uncertainty about the correct posting: in some cases this can lead to invoices being after the due date and can create extra costs for the agency in the form of interest and charges. dfc is currently testing solutions from two companies, one of which involves an accounting robot that uses al to propose the correct posting: the model is trained using historical data before making a prediction of the posting based on a combination of historical data and information obtained from the actual invoice sources: norwegian state educational loan fund and norwegian government agency for financial management  public paid



the government will therefore ask the norwegian digitalisation agency to facilitate cooperation in al for example by establishing common use cases/user journeys and sharing of best practice. public-private partnerships norway's public sector procures goods and services worth more than nok  billion annually: these procurements can be used to promote innovation and use of new technologies. a study conducted by menon33 shows that most public procurement processes are conducted without any market dialogue and without encouraging suppliers to supply systems that are radically new and innovative: the companies report that young, innovative companies in particular find it difficult to know what they need to do to win contracts. an innovation partnership is a procurement procedure that facilitates product and service development through cooperation between buyers and developers/suppliers. innovation partnerships are used for procuring solutions that are not currently available in the market: preliminary experiences show that startups and technology companies win assignments in innovation partnerships more easily than in other public tendering processes one of the measures in the government's digital strategy34is to establish a programme for increased interaction between the public sector and start-up companies, modelled on similar programmes in the united states and the united kingdom: such a programme would also benefit companies whose activities are based on artificial intelligence:  menon economics (): midtveisevaluering av nasjonalt program for leverandorutvikling [midway evaluation of the national programme for supplier development] ministry of local government and modernisation (): one digital public sector. digital strategy for the public sector - the government will develop guidance on responsible use of artificial intelligence in public administration facilitate cooperation and exchange of experience and best practice for al in both central and municipal administration establish a new programme for interaction between startups and the public sector present white paper on innovation in the public sector



the government wants norway to lead the way in developing and alwith respect for individual rights and freedoms: in norway, <ghosthousex, h.o. (int) artificial intelligence will be based on ethical principles; respect for photo: electronical martin hieslmair privacy and data protection; and good cyber security.  trustworthy al norway is known for the high level of trust citizens have in each other and in public and private institutions the government wants to maintain and strengthen this trust at the same time as artificial intelligence is adopted in new and innovative ways. the government believes that: artificial intelligence that is developed and used in norway should be built on ethical principles and respect human rights and democracy research, development and use of artificial intelligence in norway should promote responsible and trustworthy al development and use of al in norway should safeguard the integrity and privacy of the individual security should be built into the development; operation and administration of al solutions supervisory authorities should oversee that al systems in their areas of supervision are operated in accordance with the principles for responsible and trustworthy use of al using ars cyber



. issues related to artificial intelligence developing and using artificial intelligence can create challenges and raise many complex questions. this particularly applies to al that builds on personal data. big data versus data minimisation a certain amount of data is needed to develop and use artificial intelligence at the same time; one of the principles of data protection is data minimisation, which requires the amount of personal data collected to be limited to what is necessary for fulfilling the purpose for collecting it: consequently, the need for large datasets can conflict with the principle of data minimisation. although enterprises planning to implement a project based on al will want to obtain as much data as possible; the starting point must be to select a relevant sample and a dataset that is sufficiently large enterprises can also consider whether there are other more privacy-friendly methods of gaining access to the personal data needed, such as anonymised data, synthetic datasets or various encryption methods. the norwegian data protection authority has published a guide on artificial intelligence and privacy which covers this and other issues. data quality it is not only the amount of data that is important for artificial intelligence; the quality and structure of the data must also be errors in the data can have an impact on the analyses performed: moreover; there must be metadata describing the content of the different data fields. a good start is for individual organisations to put their own house in order36, meaning that they an overview of what data they manage, what the data means, what it is used for, what processes it is used in, and whether legal authority exists for sharing it. one challenge to quality that particularly applies to artificial intelligence is what is known as bias. bias occurs if we have datasets which only contain information about part of the relevant source data. if an algorithm that is meant to recognize images of dogs is only trained using images of dogs playing with balls, the algorithm may reason that it cannot be a picture of a dog if no ball appears in the image. similarly, it is problematic if an algorithm meant for facial recognition is trained on images of faces from a single ethnic group. bias can occur for other reasons; for example, a training dataset for supervised learning may contain bias resulting from human misjudgements or historical bias in the source data (on account of, for example, the conventional view of men as holders of certain types of positions, or if the data contains more images of women than men by a kitchen sink) artificial intelligence can also be influenced by who defines the problems: norwegian data protection authority (): artificial intelligence and privacy: www datatilsynet no/en/regulations-and-tools/reports-on-specific-subjectsiai-and-privacyl difi (): veileder for orden eget hus [guide to putting one's own house in order]:  key good. any gain



lack of transparency one challenge with artificial intelligence is the lack of transparency in some solutions based on deep learning: some deep learning algorithms can be likened to a 'black box' , where one has no access to the model that can explain why a given input value produces a given outcome most systems based on al are not black boxes, however, and render it possible to understand and document how decisions are made: in areas where explainability is important; an alternative approach to deep learning might be more appropriate at the same time, much research is being conducted in the field of 'explainable al' , which aims to make black box algorithms explainable. this is not the same as publishing the code behind an algorithm or allowing full access to full datasets, because such an approach may breach intellectual property rights and data protection laws. instead, explainable al can analyse what data had significance for the outcome and what significance the different elements had, and thereby explain the logic behind the outcome: autonomy finally, the fact that artificial intelligence is characterised by autonomy, and that it can make decisions and initiate actions without human interaction, presents a challenge: although the degree of autonomy will vary, it nonetheless raises questions about responsibility for the consequences of such decisions and how such autonomy can be limited. the initial discussions on ethics for artificial intelligence originated in issues of  autonomy. . ethical principles for artificial intelligence in its global risk report ,the world economic forum characterises artificial intelligence as one of the emerging technologies with the greatest potential benefits but also the greatest risks. there is therefore a need to continuously discuss what is responsible and desirable development and what we can do to prevent undesirable development in this area_ the european commission set up an expert group which has drawn up ethical guidelines for trustworthy use of artificial intelligence. the guidelines are based on the charter of fundamental rights of the eu and on international human rights law. the purpose of the guidelines is to promote responsible and sustainable development and use of artificial intelligence in europe: for development and use of al to be defined as trustworthy, the european commission's high-level expert group believes that it must be lawful, ethical and robust: on this basis, the expert group has proposed seven principles for ethical and responsible development of artificial intelligence. the government will adopt these principles as its basis for responsible development and use of artificial intelligence in norway:  see for example isaac asimov's three laws of robotics. asimov, isaac (): runaround' i, robot (the isaac asimov collection edition.). new york city: doubleday independent high-level expert group on artificial intelligence set up by the european commission (): ethics guidelines for trustworthy al 



the principles largely address artificial intelligence that builds on data from or that affects humans, but they are also relevant for industrial use of al built on data that does not constitute personal data: satisfying all seven principles simultaneously can prove challenging: tensions may arise that create a need to make trade-offs. such trade-offs should be addressed in a rational and methodological manner. where no ethically acceptable trade-offs can be identified, the development and use of the al solution should not proceed in its current form. ail decisions made regarding trade-offs must be reasoned and documented. if unjust adverse impacts occur in a solution built on al, mechanisms should be in place to ensure that such impacts can be reported. particular attention should be to vulnerable persons or groups, such as children. ) al-based solutions must respect human autonomy and control the development and use of artificial intelligence must foster a democratic and fair society by strengthening and promoting the fundamental freedoms and rights of the individual. individuals must have the right not to be subject to automated processing when the decision made by the system significantly affects them. individuals must be included in decision-making processes to assure quality and give feedback at all stages in the process ('human-in-the-loop') ) al-based systems must be safe and technically robust al must be built on technically robust systems that prevent harm and ensure that the systems behave as intended: the risk of unintentional and unexpected harm must be minimised: technical robustness is also important for a system's accuracy, reliability and reproducibility: ) al must take privacy and data protection into account artificial intelligence built on personal data or on data that affects humans must respect the data protection regulations and the data protection principles in the general data protection regulation. ) al-based systems must be transparent decisions made by systems built on artificial intelligence must be traceable, explainable and transparent: this means that individuals or legal persons must have an opportunity to gain insight into how a decision that affects them was made: traceability facilitates auditability as well as explainability: transparency is achieved by, among other things, informing the data subject of the processing: transparency is also about computer systems not pretending to be human beings; human beings must have the right to know if they are interacting with an al system. ) al systems must facilitate inclusion, diversity and equal treatment when developing and using al, it is especially important to ensure that al contribute to inclusion and equality, and that discrimination be avoided: datasets that are used to train al systems can contain historical bias, be incomplete or incorrect: identifiable and discriminatory bias should, if possible, be removed in the collection phase: bias can be counteracted by putting in place oversight processes to analyse and correct the system's decisions in light of the purpose  paid



) al must benefit society and the environment artificial intelligence must be developed with consideration for society and the environment; and must have no adverse effects on institutions, democracy or society at large ) accountability the requirement of accountability complements the other requirements, and entails the introduction of mechanisms to ensure accountability for solutions built on al and for their outcomes, both before and after the solutions are implemented. aili al systems must be auditable: the government wants public debate on the ethical use of artificial intelligence and on what applications of artificial intelligence we want to adopt in norway: norway has a number of bodies whose mandate is to invite public debate on technology and ethics, such as the norwegian data protection authority, the norwegian board of technology, and the norwegian national committees for research ethics: privacy by design and ethics algorithms can be controlled by facilitating access or audit; but it is more appropriate for developers as well as users to build privacy and ethical considerations into systems from the outset: such a mindset has already been established with regard to privacy. privacy by design is a requirement in the general data protection regulation, and means that consideration must be given to privacy in all phases of development of a system or solution: this is so as to ensure that information systems meet the requirements of the personal data act and safeguard the rights of the individual. likewise, ethical considerations should be built into algorithms during development: among other things, it will be important to assess whether an algorithm may lead to discrimination and whether it is sufficiently robust to withstand manipulation: ethical evaluations may also call for considering potential environmental impacts and whether a system contributes to achieving the un sustainable development goals. work on privacy by design and ethics require those who work on solutions based on al to possess or acquire the necessary competence: higher education institutions ought to evaluate how privacy and ethics can be integrated into their programmes in, for example, information technology and data science: artificial intelligence and research ethics the act relating to the organisation of work on ethics and integrity in research (lov om organisering av forskningsetisk arbeid) imposes a duty of care on researchers and research institutions to ensure that all research be conducted in accordance with recognised standards for research ethics. research institutions have a responsibility to ensure that candidates and employees receive training in recognised standards for research ethics and that everyone conducting or participating in research be familiar with them. the national committee for research ethics in science and technology recently submitted a report on research ethics in which it proposes nine principles for al research in three areas:  den nasjonale forskningsetiske komite for naturvitenskap og teknologi (): forskningsetisk betenkning om kunstig intelligens  key



a) responsibility for development and use of autonomous systems: research in al must safeguard human dignity, assign responsibility, be explainable, and promote informed public debate: b) social implications and responsible research: research in al must acknowledge uncertainties and ensure broad involvement: big data: research in al must protect privacy and the interests of individuals, ensure reproducibility and quality, and promote equal access to data: challenges for consumers use of al offers many advantages to consumers, such as the development of an ever increasing range of new services that simplify everyday life. but it also presents challenges with respect to privacy, transparency and consumer rights consumers are particularly vulnerable when al is used to develop personalised services and targeted marketing based on collecting and processing consumers' personal data: there is growing concern internationally that businesses are failing to take consumers' privacy seriously enough. survey from consumers international4 shows that consumers appreciate what al technology can do; it gives them independence; entertainment and motivation in new and interesting ways. but the survey also shows that consumers are unsure about how their personal data is used and who is behind the data processing: they seek more clarity and control: when services and marketing are made increasingly personalised, consumers risk subjected to discriminatory treatment and arbitrary non-transparent decisions such as price discrimination: moreover, personalised marketing and other commercial practices developed using al can manipulate and mislead consumers into making decisions that are not in their interests. al affects many aspects of consumer's social life and will encompass different sectors of society. the use of al raises legal issues under various sectoral legislation, particularly in competition, privacy and data protection, and consumer protection. it is therefore important that the relevant supervisory authorities cooperate on this issue. they should develop competence and information, and participate in international forums such as the digital clearinghouse, the european forum for consumer, competition and data protection enforcement bodies. in the white paper on the consumer of the future, the government announced that it will create a similar cooperation forum at national level: digital clearinghouse norway: regulation of artificial intelligence in the consumer sector norway has a tradition of strong consumer protection laws. efforts are being made in norway and the eu to provide consumers with strong and enforceable rights that are adapted to digital life. as part of these efforts, the eu has adopted a number of regulatory acts that will strengthen consumer rights online, such as the proposed package of measures called the new deal for consumers while these regulatory acts consumer international (): artificial intelligence: consumer experiences in new technology meld. st_  (-) framtidas forbrukar gron, smart 0g digital.

do not specifically address al, the european commission has stressed that al will be one of the key areas in the time ahead. norwegian authorities have been closely monitoring the eu's work on modernisation of consumer rights and will continue to do so_ international cooperation on ethical and trustworthy ai norway is engaged in an array of international forums that work on strategies and guidelines for ethical and trustworthy artificial intelligence, among them the un, eu, oecd and the nordic council of ministers. united nations norway participates in processes, activities and discussions across the un system dealing with applications of al. thematic areas in which al is given attention span from eliminating hunger, combating climate change and efforts to promote good health for all to discussing disarmament and international security. european union norway, represented by the ministry of local government and modernisation, has participated in eu activities related to al from the start; and was involved in, among other things, preparing the european commission's coordinated plan on artificial intelligence from december . the eu is working towards human-centric and trusted ai: norway participates in this work and sits on the steering group that is developing a coordinated approach to al together with the european commission and the member states: the european commission is expected to submit a legislative proposal on ai regulation in . a new regulatory framework for al is expected to build on the ethical principles for developing and using al published by the eu's high-level expert group in april ,on which the government has based its ethical principles for al. norway will be actively involved in the work carried out on any future regulatory framework for al. oecd the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) is working on al and has published several reports on the topic norway, represented by the ministry of local government and modernisation, has participated in oecd's work on preparing a recommendation on artificial intelligence. this was finally approved on  may . the recommendation identifies values for trustworthy al, namely: inclusive growth, sustainable development and well-being; human-centred values and fairness; transparency and explainability; robustness, security and safety; and accountability. in addition, oecd makes recommendations pertaining to randd in al, fostering a digital ecosystem for al and shaping public policy on al. the importance of building human capacity and preparing for labour market transformation is also highlighted: european commission () communication from the commission to the european parliament; the council and the european economic and social committee a new deal for consumers in  the international telecommunication union (itu) published a summary of un activities on al: handle ituint/1l1002lpub/8120d5d5-en european commission (): coordinated plan on artificial intelligence (com()  final) oecd (): recommendation of the council on artificial intelligence, oecd/legal/  key -



furthermore, the oecd points out the importance of international cooperation for ensuring ethical and trustworthy al: council of europe the council of europe is concerned with the potential impacts f al on human rights. the european court of human rights (echr) has as of  not yet heard any cases in which artificial intelligence has been the central issue, though it has touched on the topic in some contexts. in the autumn of  the council of europe set up an ad-hoc committee to examine the opportunities and risks posed by al in respect of human rights norway, represented by the ministry of justice and public security, participates in this work nordic council of ministers and nordic-baltic cooperation nordic cooperation on digitalisation will promote the nordic and baltic countries as a cohesive and integrated digital region: through binding cooperation and projects, the nordic countries will find solutions to problems encountered by citizens and businesses, promote innovative technologies and services, and make it easier to develop new services for individuals and businesses throughout the region: nordic - baltic agreements have been signed on closer cooperation on 5g, al and data sharing: the government will encourage development and use of artificial intelligence in norway to be based on ethical principles and to respect human rights and democracy encourage industry and interest organisations to establish their own industry standards or labelling or certification schemes based on the principles for responsible use of artificial intelligence encourage the educational institutions to consider how privacy and ethics can be given a central place in their programmes in artificial intelligence expect the supervisory authorities to have the competence and authority to supervise artificial intelligence systems within their areas of supervision in order to, among other things, ensure compliance with the principles for responsible and trustworthy artificial intelligence establish a cooperation forum for consumer, competition and data protection enforcement bodies: digital clearinghouse norway continue to participate in european and international forums, including the eu's work towards creating a regulatory framework to promote responsible and trustworthy use of artificial intelligence and towards modernising consumer rights in light of digital developments stimulate public debate on the ethical use of artificial intelligence



. security to ensure a well-functioning digital society, we must minimise the risk of affected by adverse cyber incidents. the government therefore considers cyber security to be a priority area. in january  the government presented a national strategy for security46 and national strategy for cyber security competence. the cyber security strategy defines goals for five priority areas: norwegian companies shall digitalise in a secure and trustworthy manner, and improve their capability to protect themselves against cyber incidents. critical societal functions shall be supported by robust and reliable digital infrastructure. enhanced cyber security competence shall be aligned with the needs of society. norwegian society shall improve its capability to detect and manage attacks. the police shall enhance its capability to combat cyber crime. the ministry of justice and public security and the ministry of defence have overarching responsibility for following up the national cyber security strategy for norway: the individual ministries are responsible for ensuring that the strategys priorities and measures are followed up in their respective sectors. cyber security and artificial intelligence have two aspects: security in solutions based on artificial intelligence, and solutions based on artificial intelligence for enhanced cyber security. the competence needs in these areas will largely overlap. there is also need for in-depth specialisation in security architecture for protecting al systems, and for specialisation in algorithms/big data for alto protect it systems and society: security in al-based systems implementing an al system entails applying conventional technologies such as sensors, communication networks, data centres, big data and software: an al system will inherit vulnerabilities from these technologies and will also introduce new vulnerabilities as part of the new al-based solution: in this respect; al systems are no different from conventional it or from conventional methods of working on cyber security: as with other it systems, a structured, holistic approach to cyber security is needed before an al system is deployed: the norwegian national security authority's basic principles for cyber security provide all norwegian organisations with a starting point for identifying what they should consider in their security activities, regardless of size, maturity and competence: ministries (): national cyber security strategy ministry of justice and public security (): national strategy for cyber security competence being cyber cyber using good



artificial intelligence in law enforcement the norwegian police university college and ntnu in gjovik are cooperating on a project that examines the use of different forms of artificial intelligence for analysing big data, aimed at detecting, preventing and investigating economic crime: the objective of the ars forensica project is to produce new knowledge that can improve prevention, investigation and prosecution of incidents without compromising privacy and the rule of law: some examples of the research challenges are: i) vast amounts of electronic data that need to be analysed ii) fragments of evidence that are hidden in chaotic environments iii) varying quality in digital trails, and possibilities to plant/distort digital trails iv) dynamic environments and continually changing situations/contexts v) lack of knowledge, and vi) decisions characterised by uncertainty and conjecture the project is funded by the research council of norway's iktpluss programme: sources: ntnu/ars forensica for many organisations, al as a service will be provided by external parties with the necessary competence and computing power. this can create challenges in terms of transparency, integrity, accountability and traceability. this must be taken into account when procuring the service. both the norwegian digitalisation agency and the norwegian national security authority have issued guidance material on security in connection with outsourcing and procuring cloud services. an ai-based it system must be trustworthy as well as robust; secure, safe and accurate: depending on the system's purpose, error or manipulation can in some cases have significantly more far-reaching consequences for an al system than for a conventional it system: this must be taken into account when performing a risk assessment of such systems: protection of digital infrastructure the existing early warning system for digital infrastructure has been used to detect targeted cyber attacks for almost  years. the norwegian national security authority is now developing new sensor technology that will build on and eventually replace the sensors used in the existing early warning system. a new platform will be developed to use artificial intelligence and machine learning on the data collected: the platform will enable automatic analysis of malware detected as well as automatic sharing of results source: norwegian national security authority  any



use of al for enhanced cyber security systems built on artificial intelligence are becoming increasingly widespread, and will be one of the prerequisites for the success of norway's future digitalisation efforts. this also applies to organisations engaged in security activities and in cyber security in particular. most security organisations regard the use of al systems as necessary for identifying threats and threat agents, and for being able to withstand and manage attacks. ai-based cyber security solutions contribute to faster detection and management of incidents and to more precise and detailed analysis: machine learning and data-driven technology can also help prevent vulnerabilities in software development: simula researches technologies aimed at helping software developers predict vulnerability in source code during development and thereby prevent security holes which subsequently could be exploited by threat agents. the government will develop norway's capacity to detect and respond to cyber attacks using al develop the norwegian national security authority as a tool for guidance, problem solving and cooperation, with the aim of building its expertise in securing al systems and in using al for enhanced cyber security cyber

introduction iti aayog released the national strategy for n artificial  intelligence (nsai) discussion paper in june , in pursuance of the mandate entrusted to it by the hon'ble finance minister in the budget speech of  . nsai while highlighting the potential of artificial intelligence (ai) for   accelerating   growth also emphasised the social potential of large scale adoption of al with a focus on themes of inclusivity, adopting the theme of al for all' . towards promoting development as well as adoption of al, the nsai made broad recommendations for supporting and nurturing an al ecosystem in india under four heads, (a) promotion of research; (b) skilling and reskilling of the workforce; (c) facilitating the adoption of al solutions; and (d) the development of guidelines for 'responsible al' . while underlining the role of private sector and collaboration, nsai identified focus sectors where the government was expected to play the lead, viz. health, education, agriculture, smart cities and mobility: nsai recommended establishment of clear mechanisms to ensure that the technology is used in a responsible manner by instilling trust in their functioning as a critical enabling factor for large scale adoption in a manner that harnesses the best that the technology has to offer while protecting citizens need for a fine balance between protecting society (individuals and communities) without stifling research and innovation in the field was underlined: the future of al is determined by a diverse group of stakeholders, including researchers, private organisations, government; standard-setting bodies, regulators and  general citizens: around the world, various countries and organisations have defined principles to guide responsible management of al for various stakeholders. 'towards the development of responsible 'al for all' , proposes principles for the responsible management of al systems that may be leveraged by relevant stakeholders in india. case studies of al systems in india and around the  key



world are studied and the principles for responsible al are derived from the constitution of india and various laws enacted thereunder: the case studies and considerations in this paper are limited in context to 'narrow al' solutions. have been grouped into two broad buckets: 'systems considerations' arising as a result of the system design choices and deployment processes, and have the potential to impact stakeholders interacting with a al system; and 'societal' considerations, that are broader   ethical challenges pertaining to risks arising out of the very usage of al solutions for functions, and have potential repercussions on the society beyond the stakeholder interacting directly with specific systems. the paper examines following system considerations: lack of understanding an al system's functioning makes it difficult to reliably and safely deploy al systems challenges in  explaining specific  decisions of al systems makes it difficult to trust them inherent bias could make the decisions prejudiced against segments of population potential for exclusion of citizens in al systems used for delivering important services and benefits difficulty in assigning accountability privacy risks security risks; and following societal considerations: impact on jobs malicious psychological profiling the supreme court of india, in various cases such as naz foundation and navtej johar has defined the prevailing morality of our country to be based on the principle of constitutional morality: the supreme court has stressed time and on adherence to constitutional morality over social morality, with the formers reach extending beyond the mere text of the constitution to encompassing the values of a diverse and inclusive society while remaining faithful to other constitutional principles the   paper studies the various  they specific specific again



considerations under the lens of the constitutions and identifies 'principles for responsible management of artificial intelligence in india' . on the basis of systems and societal considerations, the paper identifies the following broad principles for responsible management of al:  _ principle of safety and reliability   principle of equality 3_ principle of inclusivity and non-discrimination 4_ principle of privacy and security 5_ principle of transparency 6_ principle of accountability 7_ principle of protection and reinforcement of positive human values the manner and degree of implementation of principles must provide an enabling environment for promoting a responsible al ecosystem in india. the measures may be suitably calibrated according to the risk associated with different al applications in a manner that keeps pace with technology advances: this is an evolving area of work: niti aayog is already working on part- of the paper that would provide the approach towards ongoing update of principles and enforcement mechanisms of the responsible al in the sector; private sector and academia. this paper is expected to be released shortly: consider this document to be a critical step towards #alforail and hope it starts a dialogue on ensuring that the significant and transformative potential of artificial intelligence is used for the benefit of indian citizens and humanity overall amitabh kant ceo, niti aayog specific public wm)



the need for responsible ai 



the need for responsible al rtificial intelligence (al) systems have gained prominence over the last decade due to their vast potential to unlock economic value and help mitigate social challenges: thus not only the development but also adoption of al has seen a global surge in recent years it is estimated that al has the potential to add usd  billion, or  percent of current gross value added to india's economy in . it is projected, that the al software market will reach usd  billion by , up from usd . billion in . the rapid increase in adoption can also be attributed to the strong value proposition of the technology: the national strategy for artificial intelligence (nsai) has successfully brought al in the centre-stage of the reform agenda of the government by underlining its potential to improve outcomes in sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, or education. role that al plays in facilitating improved scale of delivery of specialized services (remote diagnosis or precision agriculture advisory) and improved inclusive access to government welfare services (regional language chatbots or voice interfaces)   implies a whole new for  government interventions in these sectors. further the nsai underlines the need for a robust ecosystem that facilitates cutting edge research to not only solve for these societal problems and serve as the test bed of al innovations but at the same time enable india to take a strategic global leadership by scaling these solutions globally: as these factors continue to favour the increased application of al to a variety of private and use cases, it is expected that al usage will become ingrained and integrated with society: in india, large scale applications of al are being trialled everyday across sectors? . in uttar pradesh, for example, , cctv rewire for growth: accelerating india's economic growth with al, accenture ()  artificial intelligence market forecasts omdia; dc futurescape: worldwide it industry  predictions   gov.in/case-studies path public



cameras were installed for the 'prayagraj kumbha mela' in . the cameras would raise an alert when the crowd density exceeded a threshold, and the connected integrated command and control centres provided the security authorities with relevant information'. wadhwani al is testing an al-powered smartphone-based anthropometry tool that will empower health workers to screen low-birth-weight babies without any specialised equipments. niramai, a startup, has developed an early-stage breast cancer detection system using a portable, non-invasive, non-contact al-based device. researchers from iit madras are looking to use al to predict the risk of expectant mothers dropping out of healthcare programmes, to improve targeted interventions and increase positive healthcare outcomes for mothers and infants? . box : artificial intelligence in this document, the scope and definition of al is similar to the one mentioned in the national strategy for al,  (nsai, )- a constellation of technologies that enable machines to act with higher levels of intelligence and emulate the human capabilities of sense, comprehend and act: computer vision and audio processing can actively perceive the world around them by acquiring and processing images, sound and the natural language processing and inference engines can enable al systems to analyse and understand the information collected. an al system can also take decisions through inference engines or undertake actions in the physical world. these capabilities are augmented by the ability to learn from experience and keep adapting over time. this paper studies the ethical implications of 'narrow al' , which is a broad term given to al systems that are designed to solve challenges that would ordinarily require domain experts both systems and societal considerations are explored from the perspective ofnarrow al only: broader ethical implications of 'artificial general intelligence' (agi) or artificial super intelligence' (asi) are not considered in this paper: further; systems considerations considered in this document mainly arise from decisions taken by algorithms: artificial intelligence real showstopper of kumbh mela    /wwwwadhwaniai.org/work/maternal-newborn-child-health/  /wwwniramai.com/  // dia-.html speech. specific 



while the potential of these solutions to improve productivity, efficiency and outcome is well established, the nsai () also advocated for managing the al systems responsibly: around the world, instances of harm caused by deployment of al systems have been realised: al systems appear to have prejudices in certain decisions and this amplified when used in large scale, such as when the system to allocate healthcare in the usa was found to discriminate against black people8. the blackbox nature of a/ and its 'self-learning' ability make it difficult to justify its decisions and in apportioning liability for errors. al systems often lack transparency and the user is unaware that are dealing with a chatbot or an automated decision-making system, this awareness being to build trust with the user: safety and robustness of al systems can pose serious challenges especially in high risk prone applications; unequal access to al powered applications for marginalized populations can further accentuate digital divide. according to a capgemini report, % of the  surveyed organisations in india have encountered ethical concerns from the use of a/"". there are also concerns of al systems leading to job loss due to automation: the usage of al for malicious intent for e.g: fakes to create misinformation have shown to have serious repercussions on society with instances of al system enabled targeted propaganda, leading to social discord. the risks ofnot managing al systems responsibly also has a significant economic impact  multiple firms placed a moratorium on facial recognition technology after   issues   around bias  against  specific  population  groups   emerged? . a survey by capgemini shows that ethical al interactions drive customer trust and satisfaction- with al systems that are seen as ethical have a  net-promoter-score (nps) advantage over the ones that are not: over % executives agreed that it is important to ensure that al systems are ethical and % of senior executives report to have abandoned an al system due to ethical  concerns_ this paper aims to study the risks from the use of al systems in india and around the world: in this regard, the impact of al systems may broadly be divided into following two groups:  /wwwnature com/articles/d41586---   com/articles////ibm-quits-facial-recognition.aspx .  /www capgemini com/wp-content/uploads///a-in-ethics_web-pdf  gets they key deep point



a_ direct impacts-defined as the implications that are caused due to citizens (or primary affected stakeholders') being subject to decisions of a al system. these   typically result from system design choices, development and deployment  practices and are studied under systems considerations. for example, al for cancer screening needs consideration for the patients privacy in its design b_ indirect impacts-defined as implications caused due to the overall deployment of al solutions in society: this has potential repercussions on society beyond the stakeholder directly interacting with the system and are studied under societal considerations. such considerations may require policy initiatives by the government: this document examines the potential risks, followed by a study of legislative practices and technology approaches of managing them and goes on to recommend principles for responsible management of al systems. the principles are expected to safeguard interest and also promote innovation through increased trust and increased adoption. besides establishment of principles there is a need to formulate enforcement mechanisms that would ensure the   principles are adopted across board, including the sector; private sector and academia in a manner that balances innovation and potential risks. part-ii of the series on responsible al for all will the enforcement mechanisms to translate principles to practice. specific public public explore



exploring the ethical considerations he considerations in this section were chosen on the basis of expert consultations, desk review of examples of al deployment globally, and interviews with agencies deploying al solutions in india. the causes for considerations may be deeply interconnected and, in some cases, partially overlapping: considerations have thus been divided in a manner that identifies distinct risks pose to various stakeholders.  they



systems considerations box : the blackbox problem while the advances in machine learning algorithms and techniques have greatly contributed to higher accuracy, the underlying al systems have also become increasingly opaque: such systems have been successful in using a large number of features to make complex and sometimes consequential decisions but without exposing the underlying rationale. in traditional statistical approaches, human programmers influence the choice of parameters and the mechanism to influence a prediction: in al systems, input to the model (called features) are provided with the correct' output through annotated labels during the training: the al system then identifies the relationship between input features and the labels. understanding this relationship becomes harder as the models become increasingly complex this manifests itself as the inability to fully understand an als decision-making process and the inability to predict the al's decisions or outputs-also known as the black box problem'  the blackbox problem does not exist for all forms of machine learning solutions, and there are means of performing similar functions using more rule-based"" techniques, although the accuracy may be significantly lower the accuracy vs interpretability trade-off has limited the applicability of al systems in several high-stakes decision making: one of the major global research efforts is around identifying models that are highly accurate and explainable.  . bathaee, yavar: the artificial intelligence black box and the failure of intent and causation: harvard journal of law and technology volume , number  spring  .  /arxiv org/pdf/..pdf .  / mil/program/explainable-artificial-intelligence  along



the considerations emerging from this property of  deep learning technology manifest themselves in several ways. for example, it is difficult to establish if an al system can be deployed safely and reliably without understanding and  controlling how it works;   trusting an al system's decision becomes a challenge if there is a disagreement due to lack of explanation; improving a model performance is difficult when the root cause is unknown. systems consideration : understanding the al system's functioning for safe and reliable deployment as mentioned in box , machine   learning models learn by   identifying relationships between input features and output labels. model evaluation is typically done by holding out a portion of the datasets as a test dataset: this may not necessarily reflect the various real world deployment scenarios and when the relationship between the input features and output is not understood, it becomes difficult to predict its performance in a new environment: this makes it difficult to reliably deploy and scale such al systems. the issue its implications while accuracy gives a reasonable the system could pick spurious view into how a system performs, correlations, in the underlying data, understanding decision making leading to accuracy in test process is important to ensure safe datasets but significant errors in and reliable deployment deployment box : wolf or husky? in an example referenced in ribeiro et al,, (),an image classification algorithm performed reasonably well in its prescribed task-classify the image of an animal as either a or a husky: when the model was analysed, it was found that the system was classifying images based on the background and not the animal itself. while the model performed reasonably well on the data used to test- it would clearly not do as well in the real world.   com/cloud-ai-whitepapers/al%2oexplainability%2owhitepaper:pdf . ribeiro, m:, singh, s,, and guestrin, c (, august ). why should trust you?"": explaining the predictions of classifier: retrieved august , , from  org/abs/.  good wolf any



left: husky classified as wolf. right: explanation- shows that the model is looking at the environment for classification. systems consideration : post-deployment-can the relevant stakeholders of the al system understand why a specific decision was made? while the previous consideration was on understanding the overall principles behind decision making, in certain cases, individual decisions may have significant impact and may require an explanation. there are various examples for such decisions-credit scoring, fraud detection, loan eligibility, insurance qualification, access to government services, etc: as algorithms make these decisions, very often, an end user has an expectation of factual assessment: particularly in blackbox systems, the user is sometimes neither aware of the inputs considered nor of the exact contours of the decision made by the algorithm. such explanations also satisfy a strong imperative for reason giving, a component of procedural fairness in law. in addition to providing   explanations, the deployment environment and stakeholders interacting with the al system should also be considered: the stakeholders may come from diverse backgrounds and the explanation offered by the system must be in a manner that can be understood by them: it is also important to note that the stakeholders are not only limited to the users, but also audit agencies, regulatory bodies, standard-setting entities, people affected by the decisions, etc: . c. coglianese and d. lehr; 'transparency and algorithmic governance' ()  admin: l. rev:  key



the issue its implications with 'deep learning' systems leads to: have become opaque, leading to a lack of trust by users, discouraging the 'bblack box' phenomenon; adoption; simple linear models, offer difficulty in audit for compliance and interpretable solutions but their liability; accuracy is usually lower than difficult to debug/maintain/verify learning models; and improve performance; inability to comply with sectoral regulations; box : ibm watson for oncology the absence of explanation of output or decision may affect the adoption of the technology depending on the severity of implications in a deployment of ibm watson, for  example in particular, watson for oncology-when watson's results   agreed with physicians, it provided confirmation but didn't reach a diagnosis. when watson didn't agree, then physicians simply thought it was wrong: this resulted in the system being abandoned in many hospitals around the world., lack of understanding of in individual decisions has several consequences which discourages   adoption, especially for consequential decisions. individual decisions are difficult to audit by regulatory, standards and compliance agencies besides the lack of redressal available to an aggrieved recipient given the difficulty in determining the grounds for challenging it in a court of law: for the developers of the system, identifying  specific errors and making improvements to its performance is a challenge as the inability to track the source of the error makes targeting interventions difficult: in cases where the law requires an explanation of individual decisions, it becomes prohibitive to use, even if the models are highly accurate: . forbes: time to the al 'black box .  /theconversation com/people-dont-trust-ai-heres-how-we-can-change-that-  deep specific specific help specifics open



systems consideration : consistency across stakeholders though automated solutions are often expected to introduce  objectivity to decision making, recent cases globally have shown that al solutions have the potential to be 'biased' against sections of society: this can lead to inconsistent output across a diverse demography who are otherwise similarly placed: real life manifestations of such bias tie into historically discriminatory behaviour; where members of a certain caste, class, sex r sexual orientation, among others , are denied  opportunities on the basis of an identifying characteristic even though are completely similar in all ways relevant to the decision being made:"" the emergence of bias in al solutions is attributed to a number of factors from various decisions taken across different stages of the lifecycle and the environment in which the system learns. in more rule-based machine learning techniques, the performance of the al solution is largely dictated by the rules defined by its developers in deep learning methods, the performance of the solution is defined by the data used, models chosen, parameters used, defined, etc, and the inherent complexity of such models makes it difficult to identify sources of bias. while individual human decisions are not without bias, al systems are of particular interest due to their potential to amplify its bias across a larger population due to large-scale deployment: the issue its implications different types of cognitive biases large scale deployment of ai, have been identified and tend leads to a large number of high to be unfair' for certain groups frequency decisions, amplifying (across religion, race, caste_ the impact of unfair bias. gender; genetic diversity); leads to lack of trust and since al systems are designed disruption of social order and trained by humans, based on examples from real-world data, human bias could be introduced into the decision-making process;   edu/blog/techtank////highlights-addressing-fairness-in-the-context-of-artifi- cial-intelligencel  specific they arising goals specific



box : bias in the real world bias has already led to instances of discrimination in the real world. in  amazon  experimented a machine learning-based solution to evaluate applicants by observing patterns in resumes submitted to the company a previous -year the system rated male applicants higher than females because historically, there was a higher number of male applications and trends in the data showed a historical preference for male candidates, as well: in effect, amazon's system taught itself that male candidates were preferable another example that has made headlines recently was when a passport checker used al to check if a person has blinkedi. this model, however had issues when checking people of asian descent- which was mostly attributed to the lack of asian faces in the training dataset systems consideration : incorrect decisions leading to exclusion from access to services or benefits al systems are inherently probabilistic systems and it is uncommon to find systems that are  percent accurate in their predictions for consequential decisions, like the   beneficiary identification   system, criminal identification system, the social cost of an incorrect decision is very high and typical performance indicators may not be sufficient: in a beneficiary identification system, an incorrect decision could lead to exclusion of services and benefits guaranteed by the state and in criminal identification systems, it could lead to loss of fundamental rights. when the al systems are used, particularly for critical services by the government, it is important to have processes and systems in place for raising an objection. the 'systematic' exclusion from access to services and benefits could undermine trust in the system: general lack of awareness could also lead to over-dependence due to false or exaggerated belief in such technologies (automation bias) and may further aggravate the problem. typical approach towards this is to introduce a human intervention whenever such consequential decisions are made. .  / com/articlelus-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool- that-showed-bias-against-women-iduskcnimko8g  .   periodzo. photo

total amount of cases: on the other hand, in order to ensure genuine fraudulent cases do not pass undetected, a minimum criterion is defined for the total number and the total value of fraudulent cases identified by the al system?. systems consideration : accountability of al decisions this consideration emerges mainly in more opaque forms of al in which a decision, action or inaction of the system is influenced by a variety of parameters, such as data used for training, algorithms, processes, training parameters, deployment environment etc different entities may be involved in each step of the development and deployment process in self-learning systems, the deployment environment  itself  could influence the decision- process the 'many hands problem' , associated with complex computer systems, complicates the issue of assigning responsibility under extant regimes of accountability and  legal recourse. establishing cause of action is the first step of a civil suit and an opaque al system coupled with a large number of interconnected factors  behind individual   decisions makes it  difficult for attribution of errors and assigning liabilities. examples of real-world instances of such issues is presented in box  and box and. the issue its implications decisions by al systems are lack of consequences reduces influenced by a complex network incentive for responsible action of decisions at different stages of its lifecycle. difficulty in grievance redressal deployment environment also influences self-learning al assigning accountability for harm from a decision is a challenge  rfp; ""selection of an agency to design, develop, implement, operate and maintain fraud control analytics platform for national health authority .  /stanford library sydney edu.au/archives/sum201o/entries/computing-responsibility/#..  specific making specific



box : the case of elaine herzberg in , elaine herzberg was hit by a test vehicle operating in a self-driving mode. the collision led to the first recorded case of fatality involving a self-driving car: the advanced technology at uber technologies had modified the vehicle with a proprietary automated driving system. human-backup safety driver was sitting in the car during the collision but was looking at a cellphone during the crash: the road was and illuminated by the street light: following the collision, the national  transport   safety board (ntsb) launched an investigation and identified the following: the uber atg automated driving system detected the pedestrian . seconds before   impact: although the system continued to track the pedestrian until the crash, it never accurately identified the object crossing the road as a pedestrian or predicted its had the vehicle operator been attentive, the operator would likely have had enough time to detect and react to the crossing pedestrian to avoid the crash or mitigate the impact: while uber atg managers had the ability to retroactively monitor the behaviour of vehicle operators, rarely did so_ the company's ineffective oversight was exacerbated by its  decision to remove a second operator from the vehicle during testing of the automated driving system. uber atg made several changes to address the deficiencies identified, including the implementation of a safety management system? in this situation, it was difficult to ascertain liability (safety driver or atg group or the technology itself). after the incident, uber stopped testing its self-driving vehicles across all cities the incident also caused other companies to cease road testing of their self-driving vehicles?s. in nov  , the ntsb released a report? with the following recommendations, .  /wwwntsb-gov/news/press-releases/pages/nr2o191119c.aspx .  ieee org/view-from-the-valley/transportation/self-driving/jensen-huang-on-the-uber-tragedy- and-why-nvidia-suspended-testing  group dry path. they

legal and regulatory approaches for managing al systems



legal and regulatory approaches for managing al systems malicious use of al he previous sections highlighted a number of ways in which al systems may impact the rights of citizens: it must be noted, however; that not all of these concerns are new relating to an emerging technology but already exist in various forms. in certain high-risk sectors such as health and finance, various sector legal protections and guidelines for products and services exist: however; a simple applicability of these laws to al-based decision-making processes may not be appropriate: for aspects of algorithmic decisions, new legal protections may be needed: for example, while no anti-discrimination law directly regulates decision making by al, the extant laws are equally silent about the means of decision-making that do govern41. therefore , it will fall within the jurisdiction of anti-discrimination legislation to regulate decisions arrived at through the use of al as well; particularly when the decision-making al is being used by an entity having constitutional or legal obligations to be unbiased: in the study of regulatory and legal approaches, it is important to identify the role legislation may play: the greatest risk of adopting this approach to manage al systems is that regulations have historically not kept pace with technology: al is still an evolving field and the risks are not well understood, making it difficult to design concrete  long term regulatory   approaches. regulating al is a complex topic and there are diverse views regarding what degree and what forms of regulation will be effective for its varied applications. al is a rapidly advancing technology, and a one size fits all approach may not be the most suitable approach. there is a need to balance soft governance measures with regulation depending on the use case and risks involved.  while .

principles for responsible management of al systems 



principles for responsible management of al systems he previous section identifies the need for   guiding principles for responsible management of al in india. the principles are expected to serve as a guide for various stakeholders in the al ecosystem. these principles, to be effective, must be grounded on the nation's accepted value system and compatible with international standards. different stakeholders of the al ecosystem shape the future of al, and it is essential to have a common set of principles which can guide all stakeholder groups towards responsible ai. box : al ecosystem stakeholder groups different groups shape the future of al the government citizens regulators develop policies that may impact al influenced by al systems, oversee sector specificl sector agnostic procure al systems either directly or indirectly rules and regulations private sector research community standard setting bodies develop al products and solutions research across social sector; set standards for research or technology use al products and solutions regulation; technologies that use al. ex: bis,rdso innovation in ai security auditors assess security of computer networks a common set of principles across these entities helps ensure al is used beneficially the supreme court of india (supreme court) in cases such as naz foundation and navtej johar, has defined the prevailing morality of our country to be based on the principle of constitutional morality: the supreme court has stressed time and again on adherence to constitutional morality over social morality,  and may



with the former's reach extending beyond the mere text of the constitution to encompassing the values of a diverse and inclusive society while remaining faithful to other constitutional principles: constitutional  morality has been described as the basis on which the rights of minorities can be in the face of majoritarianism, and is to be followed over societal morality, especially when the latter infringes the basic rights guaranteed by the constitution of india (constitution). box : considerations in the context of constitution of india the considerations mentioned in the previous section also find expression in the constitution under fundamental rights the relevant articles are summarized below, article : right_to_equality the constitution guarantees equal treatment of equally placed persons and groups before the law, and equal protection of the law to all. articles _  and : right against discrimination the constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion, race_ caste, sex, descent, place of birth or residence in matters of education, employment, access to spaces, etc: while the constitution prohibits discrimination based on certain markers, it also provides for positive discrimination in the form of affirmative action: article , while prohibiting discrimination, empowers the government to make provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes, and to make provisions for their admission to educational institutions, whether private, aided or unaided: article : right to _life and healthcare the constitution guarantees the right to life to all persons. various high courts have read the right to healthcare, including the right to avail health insurance, to be part of the right to life. article : right _to _privacy the supreme court has held that the right to privacy is an intrinsic part of  upheld public special

1_ principle of safety and reliability: al should be deployed reliably as intended and sufficient safeguards must be placed to ensure the safety of relevant stakeholders. risks to all stakeholders should be minimized and appropriate grievance redressal, care and compensation structures should be in place, in case of any unintended or unexpected harm: the al system needs to be monitored through its lifecycle so it performs in an acceptable manner; reliably, according to the desired goals.  principle of equality: al systems must treat individuals under same circumstances relevant to the decision equally . principle of inclusivity and non-discrimination: al systems should not opportunity to a qualified person on the basis of their identity: it should not deepen the harmful historic and social divisions based on religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth or residence in matters of education, employment; access to spaces, etc: it  should also strive to ensure that unfair exclusion of services or benefits does not happen. in case of an adverse decision, appropriate grievance redressal mechanism should be designed in a manner affordable and accessible to everyone irrespective of their background. . principle of privacy and security: al should maintain privacy and security of data of individuals or entities that is used for training the system: access should be provided only to those authorized with sufficient safeguards. . principle of  transparency: the   design and  functioning of the al system should be recorded and made available for external scrutiny and audit to the extent possible to ensure the deployment is fair; honest, impartial and guarantees accountability: . principle of accountability: aii stakeholders involved in the design, development and deployment of the al system must be responsible for their actions. stakeholders should conduct risk and impact assessments to evaluate direct and indirect potential impact of al systems on end- users, set up an auditing process (internal and if required external) to oversee adherence to principles and create mechanisms for grievance redressal in case of any adverse impact  deny public



. principle of protection and reinforcement of positive human values: al should promote positive human values and not disturb in any way social harmony in community relationships it is important to ensure that these principles are updated in the future to reflect the latest knowledge, innovation and technology advances. a mechanism for the same and a framework for the enforcement of these principles will be in part  of the paper: subsequent versions will also explore policy interventions for responsible ai:  explored specific

appendix  review of global regulatory landscape european union the eus ethics guidelines for trustworthy al is based on an approach founded on fundamental  rights. it offers   sector-agonistic  guidelines that require al practitioners to respect the proportionality between means and ends, and carefully create a balance between competing interests and objectives: it also states that the development; deployment and use of al systems must account for both substantive and procedural fairness. under general data protection regulation,  (gdpr), entities processing personal data or determining the means for the processing of personal data are required to implement technical and organisational measures that ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk involved in processing such personal data these measures include the pseudonymization and encryption of data; preserving the confidentiality, integrity and resilience of processing systems and services; and restoring the availability of, and access to, personal data in a timely manner the eu cybersecurity act,  (cybersecurity act) entrusts the european union agency for cybersecurity (enisa) with the responsibility of developing certification frameworks for cybersecurity, including the development of sectoral frameworks for cybersecurity with regards to products. in a white paper on artificial intelligence, the european commission highlighted the importance of suitably amending the product liability directive to enhance security related aspects for ai. the paper noted that the existing product safety legislation already protects against all kinds of risks arising from the product according to its use, including al products. however; it noted that certain amendments may be introduced in the product liability directive to address risks arising out of new technologies: these amendments   include 



risk assessment; human oversight at the time of design, requirements addressing the risk of faulty data at the design stage and provisions discussing and requesting cooperation between economic operators in the supply chain to ensure that safety standards are adequately preserved. singapore the privacy and security regime in singapore is consolidated under a single law the personal data protection act,  (pdpa) regulating privacy issues in al is rooted in two core data protection principles, consent  obligation and purpose limitation. the personal data protection commission (pdpc) is singapore's data protection regulator pdpc published a revised model artificial intelligence governance framework (framework) in , containing a roadmap for data protection compliance for organizations deploying ai the pdpa also requires an organization to protect personal data in its possession or under its control by employing such reasonable security arrangements' to prevent unauthorized access to data and mitigate   similar risks. these arrangements also intend to cover an assessment of the adequacy of existing safeguards, with the pdpc stressing the importance of covering all foreseeable scenarios that can potentially lead to a data breach/security risk to the personal data. towards this, it proposed a framework that stressed on the importance of having a 'human in the loop' or a 'human over the loop' based on the degree of severity and harm occasioned by the particular processing of personal data. the equivalent  data   protection standard for cross-border transfers is also adopted by the pdpa businesses deploying al systems in a manner that moves personal data from one jurisdiction to another must ensure that the entity receiving such data is bound by a series of safeguards that provide the same standard of data protection as the pdpa itself. the model al governance framework (model framework) , was drafted based on a discussion paper issued by the personal data protection commission and part of singapore's national al strategy. it provides a means for entities . benjamin wong yongquan, 'data privacy law in singapore: the personal data protection act ' [] () international data privacy law  . in the matter of an investigation under section () of the personal data protection act  and l'oreal singa- pore pte: ltd, case no. dp--b3091.

national artificial intelligence strategy for qatar executive summary artificial intelligence (al) based technologies have been steadily permeating into our lives. however; this is just the beginning: al has the potential of upending how we conduct our lives, how the economy is transacted, and how our communities are organized. in this document we provide an overview of al in the context of qatar as a country, identify the pillars to build a great al research and innovation ecosystem in qatar and follow those with recommendations for action: our vision is to have al so pervasive in all aspects of life, business and governance in qatar that everyone looks up to qatar as a role model for seamlessly transitioning into an al+x future. qatar: al+x future race for talent al augmented jobs knowledge economy strong academic and encourage local businesses attractive jurisdiction experiential learning to embrace new al solutions. to incorporate al-driven curriculum for the al+x businesses: future. invest in people and their lead and participate in ideas for qatar's future international efforts to doha as a global hub through training, immersive standardize the use of al: for attracting al talent: experiences and startup funds data and computing infrastructure launch and lead multilateral level diplomatic efforts for data-sharing among countries with small populations. world-class cloud and computing infrastructure with strict data-residency requirements. ethics and governance of ai strong ""al ethics and governance"" framework rooted in local context and aligned to international norms. guidelines for the level of explainability required for different types of decisions made by al algorithms: key



introduction qatar needs an overarching al strategy that supports the national vision and is rooted in its local context: the goal of this strategy is to leverage al to secure qatar's economic and strategic future, as envisioned in qnv2030,and prepare the society for effective adoption of al technology that is aligned with local needs and traditions. the al strategy is structured around six thematic pillars which together will guide qatar to transform itself for an al+x future. the moniker ""al+x"" refers to the emerging consensus that al technology will permeate into all secular aspects of human endeavors: health, entertainment; business activity, education and research. modern al is predicated on the use of data as a strategic resource. raw data needs to be coupled with technological capability to produce new al-driven products which will transform the normative basis of how societies operate and function. having invested heavily in an education and research infrastructure, qatar is poised to play a leadership role in an al+x future. the global ai race artificial intelligence (al) is a transformative technology of the 21st century and one of the main arenas in which nations of the world will compete: the ceo of google has stated that al may be ""more important than fire or electricity:"" this is an exaggeration, but it has become very clear that al will transform all facets of human society education, healthcare, transportation, business, entertainment; warfare, and more. the origins of al lie in the usa and the most recent developments in the field have come from north america: however; other countries are vying for ""al superpower"" status. china aims to be the global leader in al by  and is investing heavily to achieve this goal, especially in the use of ""data"" as a strategic asset. countries such as canada, japan; and the uk have also adopted al strategies that aim at global leadership. other countries such as denmark; taiwan, and south korea have developed al strategies that do not necessarily aim at global leadership, but rather at promoting the use of al throughout society and developing al solutions for local needs'. increasing local al adoption is the beginning of a journey to become competitive as a society in the global economy: the leadership in many advanced countries have concluded that capacity building in al technology is vital for a sustainable and viable economy: as al's leverage increases in a connected world economy, we will increasingly see a winner takes all"" trend dominating in businesses. this will have a serious implication on how nations, organizations, or even individuals think about building al capacity and applications that are viable. in a world where innovative ideas and software can originate anywhere and thrive, excellence is not just a lofty goal to achieve but a necessary requirement: there is no escape from excellence in the impending al future:



national artificial intelligence strategy for qatar why qatar should participate in the ai race qatar is a forward looking nation and has a clearly stated vision of using its economic advantage derived from fossil fuels to transform itself into a knowledge-based economy: indeed, the investments that qatar has already made in research and development efforts in al can serve as a foundation to build strong capabilities in the area and provide a head start to make globally recognized al-based solutions. for qatar; following are the threats and opportunities in an al future: threats in qatar; economic diversification has been identified as an inescapable step towards becoming knowledge-driven society: this implies that qatar must become globally competitive in selective niche areas. as al permeates into all sectors f human activity, not competing in the al arena will significantly hurt qatar's plans of diversification. al-enabled automation will have a profound impact on the employment landscape in all countries as qatari citizens are overwhelmingly employed in administrative white collar occupations, the threat of job tasks becoming susceptible to automation is very real in qatar: opportunities qatar has a small; educated and information technology savvy population. using al derived automation to augment human capability that enhances both capacity and capability of the qatari workforce is entirely possible in a reasonably short time horizon. by making judicious investment in al technology, qatar can accrue downstream benefits by owning the future ""means of production"".



al spring big data, algorithms, and cloud the term artificial intelligence is not new: it was coined in the summer of  by a group of renowned american scientists?. however; the field of al in its early days had a history of over-promising and under delivering: the public in the 's and 's were fascinated by promises of ""thinking machines"" that can understand language; play chess, and diagnose diseases, only to be disappointed when none of these predictions materialized in a meaningful way: this led to periods of disenchantment with al and withdrawal of funding for al projects, the so called ""al winters."" since the 1990s al has been able to deliver on its promises and there has been a much better understanding of its capabilities and its limitations. a narrow form of al grounded in data has taken root and won over skeptics. al was finally able to beat a world chess champion, drive a car autonomously, and defeat the two greatest champions in the jeopardyl game show:. al became an integral part of many technologies such as web search engines, natural language processing, logistics optimization, robotics, and medical diagnosis. the period since  onwards can be truly called an ""al spring:"" al is no longer a technology component, but rather the main enabler for many business and scientific solutions, from image recognition to self- driving cars to targeted political advertisements. the confluence of big data, algorithms and access to cheap computing power through cloud computing has created: the virtuous cycle enabling al revolution computing power big data computers become over the last two years increasingly powerful alone % of the data in and inexpensive the world was generated every year al algorithms new algorithms learn from many data examples but require extensive computing power



pillars of qatar's ai strategy the national al strategy of qatar has six pillars: education; data access, employment; business, research, and ethics it envisions two roles for qatar: first; qatar must become capable of producing world class al applications in areas of national interest and have a business environment enabling the use al as a driver for innovation. second, qatar must be an efficient consumer of al, with a properly educated citizenry, sound laws, and ethical guidelines. the national al strategy would be a powerful technological enabler for the qatar national vision . qnv  is itself organized around four pillars: economic, social, human, and environmental, and al is indispensable for all the four pillars. for example, the economic pillar calls for the development of a 'knowledge-based economy:"" by investing in al education and homegrown al solutions, the effort to ground the economy on knowledge capital can be accelerated: similarly, developing an endogenous al-based capacity for promoting transportation efficiency can help reduce pollution and foster environmental development: there are six pillars that we have identified for qatar's al strategy: these cover all aspects of al relevant to qatar and provide a framework for organizing action plans and investments in the future:



pillar : race for talent in the ""al+x"" era developing and even using al technology requires special skills that are in short supply all over the world. al is likely to be embedded in all aspects of human activity, a phenomenon that can be called ""al+x"". there is massive demand for al talent; driving up salaries and creating intense competition among companies to hire in al related roles such as data scientists and software engineers. data science and al courses at major universities and through online providers attract literally thousands of students: thus, the first pillar of qatar's national al strategy should be education and training: qatar is uniquely positioned to reap the benefits of al. more than % of the qatari population uses the internet; one of the highest rates in the world. widespread internet usage indicates that qatari citizenry is constantly being exposed to al-enabled technology including computer vision, language and speech processing and digital maps. when it comes to al, the future has already arrived. designing and producing al-products that are optimized for local needs and usage is not as far-fetched as it might seem and can be enabled by necessary education and training: al+x paradigm: al education should be an integral part of the curriculum at all educational levels in all disciplines. at the k- level, younger students should learn to deal with the recommendations of al. for example, al typically provides its recommendations in the form of probabilities, so students should learn the basics of decision-making in the face of uncertainty: the move away from sense-based towards intellectual perception is rooted in medieval islamic philosophys. students should also learn about interacting with al as part of their environment: for example, learning to reject the recommendations of al that clearly disagree with common sense. older students should have the opportunity to learn technical and philosophical aspects of al. it is also important to ""teach the teachers""about al by developing professional learning courses or online training: at the university level, computing-related departments should prepare their graduates for careers in stem and al disciplines. other academic departments should be attuned to the use of al in their disciplines and educate their graduates to be prepared when encounter it: al education also encompasses al coursesor boot camps that prepare those already in the workforce to work in al-related jobs, especially if their current jobs can be replaced by al. in addition, management and executive training that educates business leaders on the necessary basics of al should be availables. finally, in addition to growing iocal al talent; qatar should attract top al international talent in education, research, and entrepreneurship by introducing fast-track residency permits and creating a tech-friendly investment environment: recommendations: develop a strong academic and experiential learning curriculum for the al+x future (i.e-, projects/ activity driven) for k- to build local capacity for managing interactions with al, imagining/planning al solutions from a young age, and building strong foundations in computational methods and stem curriculum to develop al applications in the future. quantify the amount of necessary talent required in stem disciplines to inculcate an al ecosystem: design degree programs with in-built apprenticeship pathways (e.g-, al based medicine) where students can interact with researchers and businesses for building qatar-relevant al applications: promote a vibrant research and entrepreneurship ecosystem for innovative al applications that naturally align with qatar's national interest: adopt strategies for attracting top al talent from all over the world such as: internationally competitive incentives, fast-track residency, easy yet well-regulated data access to facilitate innovation, and policies to encourage integration of locally developed al solutions. they



national artificial intelligence strategy for qatar pillar : data access is paramount the current al revolution is based on big data, and modern al models require large amounts of data to train them: data is the key asset that underpins the resurgence in al and its usage and release needs to be strategically shepherded: one way for qatar to quickly gain an al advantage is to develop data governance rules and guidelines that facilitate broad access to and sharing of data consistent with the recently released qatar data privacy laws? . data sharing among organizations or even within an organization is impeded by two considerations. first; data has strategic and monetary value to the organization there is a saying that ""data is the new oil8 second, data sharing can violate the privacy of users. people with data are (justifiably) worried about these two considerations when they share data, so the tendency is not to share data release and sharing needs to be driven by a strategic imperative of enabling and promoting local al ecosystem: for example, china has been at the forefront of using data as a strategic tool to promote indigenous technology: data is the ""new source code"" and this perspective needs to be adopted by decision-makers in qatar: qatar has the unique advantage of being a small country that is well connected administratively: this makes development of broad data sharing guidelines possible, and it can be one of the competitive advantages of qatar in the area of ai. recommendations: qatar should create a data strategy office responsible for educating government and business organizations and developing guidelines for the use of data as a strategic resource. qatar should develop guidelines for data sharing that encourage people with data to share it and make clear the best practices for doing so. the guidelines should spell out the obligations of the receiver of the data. for government entities, these guidelines can be elevated to be mandatory policies. qatar should launch and lead multilateral level diplomatic efforts for data-sharing among countries with small populations. for most countries including qatar; developing successful al applications that can generate export revenue won't be possible without greater data sharing at a global level. there is no such multilateral initiative in the world, hence this is an opportunity for qatar to take a leadership role: being a small country with a very diverse population, qatar should leverage locally collected data by integrating and curating in ways that allow it to be repurposed and hence democratizes development of novel futuristic applications.



pillar : the changing landscape of employment there is an intense ongoing debate among experts about the impact that al technology will have on the future of employment and jobs in the coming years. the extreme view is that al technology will result in massive employment disruption as many tasks that currently require human involvement have the potential of being replaced by al. in a highly cited work carried out by researchers at oxford university, over % of jobs in the us are under risk of becoming automated? economic theory suggests that the long-term financial returns on capital tend to be higher than labor and thus those who own capital will benefit disproportionately from al technology: this has the potential of causing social upheaval and disequilibrium. the impact of al technology on qatar is likely to be very different from what other countries may experience: in fact; qatar can leverage the al revolution to realize its vision of transforming into knowledge based economy by carefully investing in strategically important al technologies  qatar is home to around . million people out of which approximately % are local qataris and the rest are non-qataris who reside in the country specifically on the basis of employment: most qataris working outside the military and security forces have white-collar occupations, primarily in the public sector: many of these white-collar jobs are, in principle, susceptible to outright al replacement or al augmentation""o . for example, according to the  qatar labor survey, % of the qatari male and % of the qatari female workforce is employed in clerical positions"" . single-skill white-collar positions such as these are most susceptible to automation: however; nearly % of economically active qataris have a university education one of the highest rates in the world. by embracing al and encouraging its citizens to be al-skilled, qatar can become one of the first countries in the world where citizens and al technology can work together in harmony: sidra medicine 



national artificial intelligence strategy for qatar consider the example of qatar's burgeoning medical tourism industry: qatar is ranked 30thin the world1z for medical tourism and is rapidly developing a world-class medical infrastructure with several hospitals having already obtained highly sought after international accreditation. al technology can help qatar accelerate the growth in medical tourism and provide knowledge jobs for qatari citizens and residents. for example, international standards for the ratio of nurses to patients range from : to : depending on the nature of the medical treatment: however; many of the procedural tasks that a nurse carries out, like checking patient health parameters and delivery of medication, can be automated by existing al technology: the replacement of these tasks will not only be cost-efficient; but will lead to higher quality of service as machines are likely to make fewer human errors"" . similarly qatar is home to people from over eighty countries and there are at least eight large subpopulations which speak distinct languages an al-based speech and language translation system for medical communication can be built bottom up in qatar and exported to the rest of the world. however; the more human-interaction aspects of the nurse and patient relationship cannot be automated and qatari residents can be trained to carry out this particular aspect of the nursing function: thus, the augmentation of a nurse's job with al technology can be used to admit more patients per nurse, provide higher quality of care, and create specialized knowledge-intensive jobs. history shows that once the cost of using a new technology falls below a certain threshold then that technology rapidly permeates through society13. it is hard to predict what new applications will emerge that will take advantage of the emerging al technology: what remains constant is that economics is often the driver of technology adoption: one of the factors affecting the cost of adopting al in qatar compared to other countries is the ability of qatar to import low cost labor from the developing world. thus, the cost of labor intensive and inefficient solutions is often less than the cost of an al solution leading to a situation where long-term efficiencies are sacrificed for short-term benefits. recommendations: provide financial incentives to local businesses to embrace new al solutions and resist the temptation of using low-cost labor as a substitute for embracing al technology: educate/ train qatari citizens in managing, building and investing in al solutions for continuously improving the standards of living and economic productivity in qatar: key



pillar : new business and economic opportunities qatar has a modern; diverse, technology-driven business landscape. besides a world leading oil and gas industry, qatar is home to a major international airline, an influential financial sector; and a robust power generation enterprise. al will transform the economic and business landscape in qatar; and the national al strategy should address this transformation: al is already being adopted by businesses worldwide; mckinsey estimates that global technology companies such as google and baidu spent a total of s20- billion on al in . these technology companies are the early adopters of al, but investment in al is also happening in other sectors such as financial services, manufacturing, and agriculture: early adopters are already seeing the benefits of al, which is accelerating adoption by other companies. the national al strategy of qatar should enable existing businesses to adopt al, and catalyze the creation of new businesses based on al technology: for example, the qatari government can provide guidelines and best practices for businesses that plan to adopt al, or even direct financial and technical assistance to these businesses to help them in adopting al technologies. startup funds and incubators should be directed to focus on al-based companies. since data is essential for modern al, enabling access to the data that businesses need for developing their al models can be a major driver of the adoption of al in businesses. the other component of modern alis a powerful computing infrastructure. this infrastructure can be partly provided by the private sector but the government needs to play a role in ensuring that the computing infrastructure available to businesses is powerful enough to meet the demands of al. for example; the internet connectivity within qatar and internationally should support the capacity requirements of al. the government can accelerate the adoption of al in the business sector by adopting al in its own public services that way businesses interfacing with al-enabled public services will feel the need to become al-enabled themselves: in addition, al-enabled public services can be a quick success for al that is felt by qatari citizens. the qatari government has a solid foundation on which to base al adoption in public services, since qatar already has a strong digital government; with services such as metrash, hukoomi; and baladiya/oun"". it is befitting to augment these services with al capabilities, resulting in more efficient service delivery that better responds to citizens' needs. recommendations: make investment commitments to develop programs for leveraging al in areas of strategic importance for qatar; e.g., oil and gas. build a regulatory and incentive framework that is stable, and makes qatar an attractive jurisdiction to incorporate by al driven businesses around the globe: develop and maintain cutting edge computing and connectivity infrastructure with a high degree of resilience. launch and participate in international efforts to bring standardization in all aspects of ai, e.g-, network and systems architecture; data and application integration protocols, requirements on test case coverage, services, etc. that ensure a level playing field. 



national artificial intelligence strategy for qatar pillar : qatar al + x focus areas in some cases,it is appropriate to procure existing al solutions and deploy them in qatar: however; there will be cases where it is imperative to develop local homegrown al solutions. the reason can be that the solution addresses specific local needs of qatar; that qatar is uniquely positioned to be a global leader in developing the solution, or that the solution is highly strategic and must be controlled locally: qatar must ensure it has global al research leadership in areas of national interest; and that local technology enterprises have sufficient technical capacity to develop al solutions. some example areas where it is imperative for qatar to develop local al solutions are as follows arabic language processing: as an arabic speaking country, the use of al arabic language processing should be a national priority for qatar: qatar has a wealth of content in arabic that can be used to develop al models, and arabic language processing capabilities can enable impactful applications in education, media, security, and other areas of strategic importance. to illustrate, qatar computing research institute (qcri) has developed multiple arabic language processing systems such as an automatic speech-to-text system for arabic that is in use by the al jazeera media network, a suite of arabic text processing tools known as farasa that is considered the best in the world, and a powerful arabic-to-english translation system: qatar can be a world leader in the use of al for arabic language processing and generation. national security: cyber security has become an al problem. advanced techniques for identifying and mitigating cyber threats depend to a high degree on data analytics and ai. additionally, using al to analyze publicly available data can provide advanced warning of threats. such highly strategic infrastructure should rely on homegrown and locally controlled solutions. signals from social-media now constitute a major focus of attention by intelligence agencies around the world to infer security threats to a nation. by building local systems, which correlate network, and social media traffic can go a long way in creating another layer of security for qatar precision medicine and systems biology: al will radically transform the way healthcare and medicine is practiced. the holy grail of personalized and precision medicine and the concept of ""from bench to bedside"" is realizable with ai. a consensus is emerging within the medical research community that a systems biology perspective which harnesses multiomic (genomic, proteomic, metabolomics) data is necessary to make next generation medical breakthroughs: the qatar genome project provides fine-grained data about citizens f qatar and should serve as the basis of uncovering persistent disease patterns in the local population: a high rate of consanguinity in the local population makes the qatar genome data highly unique and its usage and release needs to be strategically guided. more lifestyle and clinical data can be acquired from wearable devices, electronic health records and even social media. high quality data with world class medical and bioinformatics research infrastructure; including hamad medical corporation, sidra medicine; weill-cornell medicine-qatar; qbri, and qcri, can catapult qatar to the forefront of personalized medicine, emergency services, and al based medical education and research.  for along



transportation and fifa world cup : qatar is undergoing a rapid expansion in transportation infrastructure, whether it is road networks, the new hamad port and airport; and expansion of qatar airways and qatar rail. this is a unique opportunity to in place al-enabled infrastructure from the get go. additionally, al can help in managing the logistics challenges of world cup ,and enhance the experience of fans in the stadium and viewers at home. these al use cases would then help build the tourism industry post . through it tasmui6 program, the motc has already proposed several use cases to transform qatar into a digitally ""smart' nation. many of these use cases already have a strong data-driven focus using al qatar can become a role model for sustainable urban development by cutting emissions in energy production and manufacturing from its current globally highest per capita levels food security: food security has been identified as a national priority by qatar: there is a tremendous potential for applying al technology at the food-energy-water nexus and many countries, mostly notably the netherlands, have taken the lead in promoting next generation precision agriculture and vertical farming techniques. there is a to generate massive amounts of data at the finest granularity level in agriculture and create customized water and fertilizer usage plans which increases crop yield and is environment friendly at the same time. al will play a big role in achieving food security in qatar and everywhere in the future when severe strain on yields and arable land is expected due to climate change. furthermore qatar should develop customized al-driven simulations to prepare contingency plans to maintain food supply pipelines in face of regional disruptions and threats. oil and gas: qatar's mature oil and gas industry stands to benefit significantly from ai. qatar-based companies have access to the most fine-grained logging data from gas operations which can be leveraged to create niche al-products in the oil and gas sector: for example the use of this data to develop solutions for predictive maintenance enabled could help realize tremendous efficiency gains and reduce production downtimes. al will also enable data driven revenue management and logistics optimization: recommendations: build applications using arabic language processing for business use cases to become the leader in this domain among the arab nations: leverage al expertise available within the country in strategically important domains for qatar like oil and gas, transportation; health, and cybersecurity to build competitive advantage in specific use cases that could also generate export revenues in the future: use fifa  to collect data and pilot al application ideas that could also benefit qatar in the run_  put push long



national artificial intelligence strategy for qatar pillar : ethics and public policy the increasing pervasiveness of al in our personal lives and work poses many ethical and public policy questions al methods tend to acquire ""black box' characteristics and sometimes are not amenable to fairness, accountability and transparency principles that are vital for the long-term viability of societies and countries. al algorithms will inherit any biases' consecrated in data and mechanisms are required that guarantee outputs which are consistent with societal norms"". transparency and accountability require al models to be explainable, i.e,, the output of an al algorithm be describable in plain natural language: explainability and interpretability in al is emerging as an important al research topic in its own right: for example consider an al algorithm that decides how patients should be prioritized to receive scarce organ transplants. if a ""pure data"" solution is used then an algorithm may inadvertently use longevity as a criterion and rank the patients based primarily on age. modern al relies on data including personally identifiable information (pii). for many technological companies the user is a product and advertisers are the customers who pay a fee to access user information: there is an increasing worldwide to treat private information as a human right and qatar should use the recently introduced general data protection regulation (gdpr) by the european union as a template to introduce guidelines that protect its citizens from online exploitationi8. qatar's ministry of transportation and communication (motc) and previously ictqatar (which is now part of motc) had issued guidelines for qatar on privacy and data sharing that are in alignment with qatar's traditions and ambitions these would form an excellent starting to develop a larger and comprehensive set of guidelines for the country: recommendations: the qatari government should introduce guidelines for the level of explainability and interpretability required for different types of decisions made by al algorithms: build up from the existing guidelines on privacy, data sharing, etc. developed by the ministry of transportation and communications (motc) and previously ict qatar: qatar should develop an ""al ethics and governance"" framework for addressing ethical and public policy questions, which will become increasingly important as the use of al expands into sensitive areas of society such as policing, courts, health, and warfare: the framework to be developed must be consistent with both qatari social, cultural, and religious norms and international guidelines while ensuring that qatar emerges as a leading proponent of ai.  push point



conclusion the proposed strategy provides specific recommendations for the leadership of qatar to set course, embark and flourish in the brave new world of artificial intelligence. globally, the consensus has been building that the advent of artificial intelligence (ai) is the next technological inflection point at par with the industrial revolution, the benefits and consequences of which we are still witnessing: those who can develop mastery in using and developing al applications will reap its benefits and thrive. qatar is well positioned to take advantage of this golden opportunity and become a critical player in the al economy of the future. however; we need to act with a sense of urgency to realize this opportunity before it becomes too late as the al race among countries is becoming very competitive. qatar needs to act on the recommendations listed under the six pillars of the proposed national ai strategy to ensure it builds sustainable competitive advantages and remains a critical player in the global economy and society: this would require significant investments in the education and retraining of its citizenry to augment their existing capabilities with al technologies and build an ecosystem conducive to developing path breaking al technologies in qatar: hbku research complex

the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan strategy : measure and evaluate al systems through standards and benchmarks. develop a broad spectrum of evaluative techniques for al, including technical standards and benchmarks, informed by the administration' s blueprint for an al bill of rights and al risk management framework (rmf): strategy : better understand the national al randd workforce needs improve opportunities for randd workforce development to strategically foster an al-ready workforce in america: this includes randd to improve understanding of the limits and possibilities of al and al-related work, and the education and fluency needed to effectively interact with al systems strategy and: expand public-private partnerships to accelerate advances in al. promote opportunities for sustained investment in responsible al randd and for transitioning advances into practical capabilities, in collaboration with academia, industry, international partners, and other non-federal entities: strategy : establish a principled and coordinated approach to international collaboration in al research: prioritize international collaborations in al randd to address global challenges, such as environmental sustainability, healthcare, and manufacturing: strategic international partnerships will help   support   responsible progress in al randd and the development and implementation of international guidelines and standards for ai. the federal government plays critical role in ensuring that technologies like al are developed responsibly, and to serve the american people. federal investments over many decades have facilitated many discoveries in al innovations that power industry and society today, and federally funded research has sustained progress in al throughout the field's evolution. federal investments in basic and applied research have driven breakthroughs enabled by emerging technologies like al across the board, including in climate, agriculture, energy, public health, and healthcare: strategic federal investments in responsible al randd will advance a comprehensive approach to al-related risks and opportunities in support of the public good. viii key



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan_ introduction to the national ai randd strategic plan:  update advances in generating, collecting, processing, and storing data have enabled innovation in al, allowing this technology to become ubiquitous in modern life and touch nearly every facet of daily activities, directly or indirectly. besides the al-enabled applications in smartphones and personal computers, applications of al have streamlined logistics, accelerated scientific discovery, enabled more efficient design and manufacturing, and aided in detecting financial fraud: however, realizing al's potential social and economic benefits and aligning it with american values requires considerable research investments, pursued in accordance with the principles of scientific integrity: in february , the office of science and technology policy (ostp) issued a request for information (rfi)  requesting input from all interested parties on the development of this plan. over  responses were submitted by researchers, research organizations, professional societies, civil society organizations, and individuals; these responses are available online. many of the rfi responses reaffirmed the analysis, organization, and approach originally outlined in the  and  strategic plans. it is noteworthy that a majority of the rfi responses referred to aspects of ethical, legal, and societal implications of al (strategy ) or safety and security of al systems (strategy ): these responses underscore a heightened   priority across academia, industry, and the public for developing and deploying al systems that are safe, transparent, and improve equity, and that do not violate privacy: responses to the rfi also emphasized the importance of supporting al randd that will develop systems capable of helping to address some of the foremost challenges and opportunities before the nation today, including advancing personalized medicine; improving cybersecurity; addressing inequities; bringing efficiencies to manufacturing, transportation, and other critical sectors of the economy; ensuring environmental sustainability; and enabling the scientific discovery and innovation that will power the next generation of technological breakthroughs. al as a national priority the biden-harris administration is committed to advancing responsible al systems that are ethical, trustworthy, and safe, and serve the public the fiscal year (fy)  president's budget request included substantial and specific funding requests for al randd, as of a broad expansion of federally funded randd to advance key technologies and address societal challenges e the chips and science act of  and consolidated appropriations act,  reflect administration and congressional support an expansion of federally funded randd, including al randd. the memorandum on multi-agency research and development priorities for the fy  budgetl issued jointly by the office of management and budget and ostp likewise calls for agencies to prioritize randd funding toward advancing national security and technological competitiveness, including trustworthy al, among other critical and emerging technologies of national interest. this plan pursues the advancement of fundamental and translational al research to make al trustworthy, equitable, and both rights- and privacy-preserving: the national al initiative act (naiia) of  established the national al initiative office (naiio) to coordinate al activities across the federal government: this office, based in the white house ostp, is the central point of contact for technical and programmatic information exchange on activities related to the national al initiative across the federal government, academia, industry, nonprofit organizations, professional societies, civil society, and state, local, and tribal governments. in addition, the naiio helps advance progress on the priorities outlined in this plan and implements a comprehensive approach to al- related risks and opportunities in support of the public good.  good. part for key



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan while randd activities and outputs inform governance and regulatory approaches, this plan leaves discussions of regulation or governance to other federal documents, such as the blueprintfor an al bill of rights and the al risk management framework in addition, issues related to scientific integrity and public access, while directly relevant to al randd, are largely left to other federal government documents as well. 



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan strategy : make long-term investments in fundamental and responsible ai research the united states has maintained its leadership in al in large part because of continued and consistent investment in long-term, fundamental al research: for example, many of today' s al-enabled products and services have their roots in federally funded fundamental research dating back decades this trend has continued since the release of the  strategic plan, with a notable increase in al randd funded by the federal government: for example, the al initiative and companion efforts funded by the department of energy (doe) office of science have enabled groundbreaking discoveries in areas from fusion energy to sars-cov- understanding: the nation must continue to foster long-term, fundamental, and responsible research in al to allow for further discoveries and innovations with long-term benefits. investments in fundamental al randd span the spectrum from foundational to use-inspired research: for example, foundational investment in al randd drives forward learning, reasoning, planning, knowledge representation, computer vision, and beyond, with potential for scale-up and adoption in practice: use - inspired al research, meanwhile, contributes to advances in al while also advancing areas such as agriculture, healthcare, manufacturing, economics, critical infrastructure, and sustainability, with the goal of engaging and improving all of society while respecting individual freedoms. of particular importance is the investment in the development of assurance and trust in al systems, as reflected in strategy  and strategy . research in these areas is essential for using al in all fields, but it is particularly important in systems that involve safety or applications in which al decisions affect individuals, groups, communities, and the environment: most al randd thus far has focused on the advancement of al for individual tasks. additional work is needed to solve increasingly difficult science and technology challenges covering multiple domains and applications, moving toward the vision of general-purpose ai. al randd increasingly attempts to consider how various areas of al work can fit together into an integrated system. as result, this strategy includes priorities that continue to advance al for individual tasks but also aim toward the vision of general-purpose al systems the priorities involve the significant amount of available data for machine learning (ml) and knowledge discovery, improving the abilities of al to perceive and act, and developing scalable, general-purpose systems to work in real and virtual environments finally, developing a theoretical understanding of the capabilities and limitations of al systems can inform what randd should be done and is critical for enabling safe use of al. for example, a better understanding of how deep networks construct effective representations could lead to new network designs that can reason about uncertainty more directly and without requiring as much data to train: this strategy is divided ten lines of effort: advancing data-focused methodologies for knowledge discovery; fostering federated ml approaches; understanding theoretical capabilities and limitations of al; pursuing research on scalable general-purpose al systems; developing al systems and simulations across real and virtual environments; enhancing the perceptual capabilities of al systems; developing more capable and reliable robots; advancing hardware for improved al; creating al for improved hardware; and embracing sustainable al and computing systems. advancing data-focused methodologies for knowledge discovery as discussed in the federal big data research and development strategic plan from , new tools and technologies are needed to achieve intelligent data understanding and knowledge discovery. for example, progress on the development of more advanced al systems will help identify useful information hidden in big data. open research questions revolve around the creation and use of data, including its veracity  using along many



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan_ and appropriateness for al system training and its role in creating interpretable, reproducible algorithms: while much research has dealt with veracity through data quality assurance methods to perform data cleaning and knowledge discovery, further study is needed to improve the efficiency of data cleaning and labeling techniques, to create methods for discovering inconsistencies and anomalies in the data, to address privacy considerations, and to develop approaches for   incorporating human feedback: researchers also need to explore new methods to enable data and associated metadata to be mined simultaneously: another major issue is the lack of adequate and representative data in many domains, such as healthcare. techniques need to be developed to deal with the generation and curation of redacted data to facilitate ml for domains with sensitive data. these and other data concerns are addressed in strategy . many al applications are interdisciplinary in nature and involve heterogeneous data. further investigation of multimodal ml is needed to enable knowledge discovery from a wide range of heterogeneous data types (e.g , discrete, continuous, text, spatial, temporal, spatiotemporal, graphs) in addition to data, one of the fundamental challenges in current al systems is the lack of a standard infrastructure to encode knowledge al systems must process and interpret significant amounts of data to approximate human-like responses hence, it is important to have different kinds of data (e.g , causal, temporal, heuristic) encoded in a form that is open and accessible. as an example, an open knowledge network12 is one concept for making this knowledge accessible, but there is need for considerable research, including developing domain-specific knowledge repositories in standardized formats. fostering federated ml approaches new federated approaches to ml will be important in an increasingly interconnected world and amid growing concerns around data privacy and security. federated learning allows multiple computers or devices to collaborate in building a shared global ml model based on the data that is locally stored on each device: the overall process is back-and-forth iteration that involves each device training a local model on its own data and then sharing only the model updates (not the data) to improve the global model: the global model is distributed back to the devices for further local training until the global model reaches a specified level of accuracy. federated learning can improve the accuracy and fairness of such global ml models by including locally-protected data from a diverse and more representative range of users, devices, and other sources that may have data-sharing restrictions due to competitive, regulatory, or privacy concerns the ability to process confidential information is critical to industries such as healthcare; finance, and telecommunications federated learning is one among a range of approaches for privacy-preserving data sharing and analytics16 major research challenges arise in dealing with the heterogeneous characteristics of devices (memory capacity, computing power, network connectivity) and data (skewed data samples, different modalities such as images, video, text) . improved efficiency in ml model communication and updating from multiple devices into a shared global model, as well as better data protection and security approaches, are areas for continuing research focus. understanding theoretical capabilities and limitations of al while the goal for many al algorithms is to address open challenges with general-purpose systems, there is not yet a understanding of the theoretical capabilities and limitations for al, nor of the extent to which such solutions are even possible with al algorithms.  theoretical work is needed to better understand how some al techniques, especially generative al, work and their emerging properties. building this understanding of what advanced systems can and cannot do is important for enabling safe and responsible use of al: while different disciplines (including mathematics, control sciences, and computer science) are studying this issue, the field currently lacks unified theoretical models or good



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan frameworks to understand al system performance: additional research is needed on computational solvability, which is an understanding of the classes of problems that al algorithms are theoretically capable of solving, and likewise, those that they are not capable of solving: this understanding must be developed in the context of existing hardware, to see how the hardware affects the performance of these algorithms. understanding which problems are theoretically unsolvable can lead researchers to develop approximate solutions to these problems, or even open new lines of research on new hardware for future al systems. pursuing research on scalable general-purpose al systems development toward scalable general-purpose al is the emergence of so-called foundation models that are trained on large amounts of unlabeled data, usually using self-supervised learning, and can be adapted to many application domains such as law, healthcare, and science: innovations continue to advance the frontiers of what foundation models can do on language and image tasks. familiar examples of large pre- trained language models include bert (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers), gpt- (generative pre-trained transformer), and other al systems with skills that might begin to resemble intelligence within certain domains. additional randd is necessary to minimize unwanted fabrications and harmful biases in generative al: these models are prone to 'hallucinate"" and to recapitulate biases derived from unfiltered data from the internet used to train them. further research is needed to enhance the validity and reliability as well as security and resilience of these large models, especially in response to adversarial attacks: further research is also needed to develop techniques for explaining and interpreting model outputs. additional work is needed to address privacy concerns related to training models on such large corpuses of data. finally, appropriate safeguards will need to be conceptualized and designed into these systems. developing al systems and simulations across real and virtual environments an emerging trend in modeling and simulation is the development of ""digital twins.' a digital twin is a virtual representation or model that serves as the real-time digital counterpart of a physical object or process. real-world applications include predictive maintenance of aircraft engines, urban planning and the management of smart cities, and additive manufacturing: requirement is that the physical system is instrumented so that the collected data is interactively shared with the digital or computational model of itself: the digital-twin approach enables smart automation of physical systems across real and virtual environments challenges specific to various applications, such as data completeness, quality, latency, and privacy, and the varying accuracies with which different phenomena can be modeled, are likely to lead to additional challenges for digital twins18 enhancing the perceptual capabilities of al systems perception is an intelligent system's window into the world. perception begins with sensor data, which come in diverse modalities and forms, such as the status of the system itself or information about the environment: sensor data are processed and fused, often along with a priori knowledge and models, to extract information relevant to the al system's task, such as geometric features, brightness, velocity or vibration: integrated data from perception forms situational awareness to provide al systems with the comprehensive knowledge and a model of the state of the world necessary to plan and execute tasks effectively and safely. al systems would greatly benefit from advancements in hardware and algorithms to enable more robust and reliable perception. sensors must be able to capture data at distances with high fidelity, often in real time. systems for perception need to be able to integrate data from variety of sensors and other sources, including edge devices and cloud systems,to determine what the al system is currently perceiving and to allow the prediction of future states detection, classification,  key long



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan_ identification, and recognition of objects remains challenging, especially under cluttered and dynamic conditions, and privacy considerations add additional complexity to designing systems for real-world applications in addition, the perception of humans, including the states of their attention and emotion, must be greatly improved by an appropriate combination of sensors and algorithms so that al systems can work more effectively with people, and as discussed in strategy . methods and techniques for calculating and propagating uncertainty throughout the perception process are needed to quantify the confidence levels that al systems have in their situational awareness and to improve overall accuracy: developing more capable and reliable robots robotics continues to harness most   fields of al, with   special  emphasis on perception,  physical manipulation, and navigation. significant advances in robotic technologies over the last decade are leading to potential impacts applications including manufacturing, logistics, medicine, healthcare, defense and national security, agriculture, and consumer products. one noteworthy development involves the introduction of al-controlled robots into the research environment, vielding autonomous laboratories"" that can enable closed-loop synthesis characterization and testing systems capable of designing new drugs, chemicals, advanced electronic materials, and countless other materials far faster and with greater variety and precision than previously possible: introducing autonomy into manufacturing can further accelerate the efficiency of product design coupled to product performance, while in biological systems, it can drive evolution of organisms to act as sensors of specified environmental signals. while robots were historically  deploved in static   industrial randd environments, recent advances involve close collaborations between robots and humans robotic technologies are now showing promise in their ability to complement; augment, enhance, or emulate human physical capabilities or human intelligence. however, scientists and engineers need to make these robotic systems more capable, reliable, easy-to- use, and safe: researchers need to improve robot perception to better extract information from a variety of sensors to provide robots with real-time situational awareness to inform decision-making: progress is needed in cognition and reasoning to allow robots to better understand and interact with the physical world: an improved ability to adapt and learn, building abstract representations of low-level physical tasks, will allow robots to generalize their skills, self-assess their current performance, and learn a repertoire of physical movements from human teachers mobility and manipulation, especially when dealing with heavy objects, are areas for further investigation so that robots can move across rugged and uncertain terrain and handle a variety of objects dexterously. robots need to learn to team together in a seamless fashion and collaborate with humans in a way that is trustworthy and predictable: robotic systems must safely and cooperatively interact with humans and other actors in complex built and natural environments research is also needed to deal with adversarial systems, or systems that operate in disguise to collect data or interfere with legitimate operations in general, robotic systems require research advances that will make them more capable and reliable, easier to use, and safer. advancing hardware for improved al while al research is often outwardly associated with advances in software, the performance of al systems has been heavily dependent on the hardware on which they run: the current renaissance in deep learning and generative al is directly tied to progress in graphics processing unit (gpu)-based2 and accelerator- based hardware technology and the associated improved memory, input/output, clock speeds, parallelism, and energy efficiency: using living



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan_ developing hardware optimized for al algorithms will enable even higher levels of performance than those of gpus: one example is ""neuromorphic"" processors that are inspired by the organization of the brain and, in some cases, optimized for the operation of neural networks. hardware advances can also improve the performance of al methods that are highly data intensive: advances in storage technology would also benefit the deployment of al systems continued research is also needed to allow ml algorithms to efficiently learn from high-velocity data, including distributed ml algorithms that simultaneously learn from multiple data pipelines. more advanced ml-based feedback methods will allow al systems to intelligently sample or prioritize data from large-scale simulations, experimental instruments, and distributed sensor systems (e.g., smart buildings and the internet of things). such methods may require advances in input hardware, including dynamic input or output decision-making, in which choices are made in real time to store data based on importance or significance, rather than simply storing data at fixed frequencies. creating al for improved hardware just as improved hardware can lead to more capable al systems, al systems can also improve the performance and resource (e.g,, energy) usage of hardware. this reciprocity will lead to further advances in hardware performance, since physical limits on computing require novel approaches to hardware designs. one example is where al is being used to predict high-performance computing (hpc) performance and resource usage and to make online optimization decisions that increase efficiency; more advanced al techniques could further enhance system performance: al can also be used to create self- reconfigurable hpc systems that can manage system faults when  they occur, without human  intervention: improved al algorithms can increase the performance of multicore systems by reducing data movements between processors and memory: in practice, the configurations of processes in hpc systems are never the same, and different applications are executed concurrently, with the state of each different software application evolving independently over time. al algorithms need to be designed to operate online and at scale for hpc systems. hpc systems are governed by physical and mathematical laws, which both determine and constrain their performance, and al algorithms that incorporate these laws into their design will be able to more efficiently optimize al hardware design in a virtuous leading to even more powerful al implementations.  loop,

the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan strategy : develop effective methods for human-ai collaboration effective methods for human-al collaboration have become an increasingly important priority as al becomes more prevalent throughout society: fully autonomous systems that involve little or no human interaction will continue to be crucial for applications in industry (e.g-, automated factories, control of energy systems), hazardous domains (e.g;, deep space, radioactive environments), and other areas_ however, other applications, ranging from disaster recovery to scientific discovery, are most effectively addressed by a combination of humans and al systems working together in a way that leverages their respective strengths and mitigates risk indeed, the promise of future al applications requires fully understanding human-al teaming and collaboration this strategy recognizes the growing importance of sociotechnical and human factors and addresses the need for multidisciplinary research in enabling effective human-al collaboration. it is divided along five lines of effort: developing the science of human-ai teaming; seeking improved models and metrics of performance; cultivating trust in human-al interactions; pursuing greater understanding of human-al systems; and developing new paradigms for al interactions and collaborations. developing the science of human-al teaming teaming is complex relationship requiring a deep understanding of human decision-making processes and their interactions. human-human teaming is supported by a substantial body of knowledge, models, and methods for enhancing team performance. the relevance of this body of work for enabling more effective human-al teams is unclear. research is needed to understand the human side of human- machine interactions. studies are needed to gain an understanding of the attributes and requirements of successful human-machine teams for efficient and effective task performance: these studies will involve understanding the additional capabilities that a machine needs in order to become an effective teammate for the relevant tasks and environments and includes the modeling of human interactions the first national al randd strategic plan defined three functional roles for al systems in teaming contexts: al performs functions alongside the human: al systems perform peripheral tasks that support the human decision-maker. for example, al can assist humans with working memory, short- or long-term memory retrieval, and prediction tasks. al performs functions when the human encounters high cognitive overload: al systems perform complex monitoring functions (such as ground proximity warning systems in aircraft), decision- making, and automated medical diagnoses when humans need assistance: al performs functions in iieu of a human: al systems perform tasks for which humans have very limited capabilities, such as for complex mathematical operations, control guidance for dynamic systems in contested operational environments, aspects of control for automated systems in harmful or toxic environments, and in situations to which a system should respond very rapidly (e.g-, in nuclear reactor control rooms): fully understanding human-al teaming requires moving beyond these three functional roles, or today's models of humans as operators, and on to the idea of teammate relationships. to become true teammates, machines will need to be flexible and adaptive to the states of their human counterparts, as well as to the environment-to intelligently anticipate their    human teammates'   capabilities and intentions, and to generalize specific learning experiences to entirely new situations. each of these capabilities represents a research challenge. other open questions that impact human-al teaming include team composition, management of situational awareness, and interaction paradigms that govern the 



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan amount of control given to the al system, when that control is granted, and how that control is distributed and transitioned.  seeking improved models and metrics of performance traditional approach for building effective human-al teams is to consider the capabilities of the humans and al systems separately, and then to investigate how the team can be brought together in an optimal fashion. qualitative and descriptive models of human-al performance will need to develop into predictive computational models that can assess the relative value of teaming compositions, processes, interface mechanisms, and other characteristics. human-al team collaborations are difficult to model well. ensuring that the team's collective abilities are significantly better is a grand multidisciplinary challenge across such areas as psychology, decision sciences, economics, and human factors engineering, among others. the challenges are compounded when accounting for unexpected events and the issues of situational awareness, trust, andthe potential for human and al biases the collaboration types of human-al teaming models will also differ among human-assisted al decision-making, al-assisted human decision-making, pure al decision-making, and al-assisted machine decision-making: significant amounts of research are required on the theories, models, data, and computational tools needed measuring,  modeling, simulating, analyzing, and understanding the effectiveness of human-al teams cultivating trust in human-al interactions the opaque nature of the programming and decision processes within al systems is a potential barrier to the trust needed for effective human-al teaming: one challenge for humans is an expectation that mechanical and automated systems will behave in deterministic way_ given similar conditions and inputs, the system should respond in the same way as before. however, al systems may behave in non- deterministic, or unpredictable, ways in response to imperfect, noisy, and complex real-world information or even simply because they are stochastic by design. furthermore, continuous learning systems will evolve over time. another challenge is related to the accuracy of al systems and appropriately calibrating understanding of system outputs that could be incorrect: trust is recognized as a factor associated with the use of al systems33 research is needed on how to establish and maintain appropriately calibrated trust among teammates in uncertain conditions and environments. pursuing greater understanding of human-al systems greater trust in and overall success of human-al teaming will stem from the lessons learned from failures that can be replicated and studied to determine what went wrong: ""recorders"" are important in all al applications, and diagnosing failures in human-al teams is particularly acute need: as the science of teaming evolves, the need for testbeds and methodologies to measure the effectiveness of human-al teaming in settings that replicate the complexity of the operational environments also becomes critically important: pursuing research in virtual environments and developing testing methodologies that measure human teaming components and the user experience are important next steps for the deployment of  successful systems that provide assurance developing new paradigms for al interactions and collaborations usability and human-centered design research demonstrate that interaction mechanisms, designs, and strategies highly influence user performance. similar research is required to understand the usability and impact of interaction design in human-al teaming: specifically, research is needed to understand the influence of interaction design on decision-making, skill retention, training requirements, job satisfaction, and overall human-al team performance and resilience: research should also include the development of new paradigms for human-al interaction to facilitate collaboration, decision-making actions, human  for key key



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan oversight, accountability, and control. a particular challenge is conveying enough information to the user while avoiding cognitive overload. other interaction challenges include enabling the user andthe machine to understand when to pass control back and forth, and how to maintain user engagement for proper situational awareness. early research has shown that relying on a ""human in the loop"" is not a universally effective method for catching errors or ensuring sound decision-making, even though these human-in- the-loop applications may give the impression of a more robust or fair system. finally, research into human-al interactions and paradigms requires controlled experiments with end users there is currently little research on the application of usability, human factors, and human-centered design to the development of al-teaming applications. open research areas include understanding user needs and user requirements; the role of context in al-teaming application use; the use of task analysis and iterative design  methods; and ways to measure   efficiency, effectiveness, and  performance of al-teaming applications: a research focus that includes end users, including the public where appropriate, provides a lens for studying how best to address existing structural inequalities in human-al collaboration, promote the development of tools for safe and effective human-al collaboration, and effectively train the human in human-al collaborative situations. 



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan strategy : understand and address the ethical, legal, and societal implications of ai al technologies hold significant opportunity, but also pose risks  that can negatively impact individuals, groups, organizations, communities, society, the environment; and the planet: like risks for other types of technology, al risks can emerge in a variety of ways and can be characterized as or short-term, high or low-probability, systemic or localized, and high- or low-impact. without proper controls, al systems can amplify, perpetuate, or exacerbate inequitable or undesirable outcomes for individuals and communities_ since the national al randd strategic plan:  update, investment in al and public awareness of the technology have increased. this has been accompanied by an increasing focus on the ethical, legal, and societal implications of responsible al. according to the  al index report, publications addressing al fairness and transparency have quintupled over the past decade. as step toward addressing concerns related to the use of al in society, the white house issued a blueprint for an al bill of rights that out five core protections to which everyone in america should be entitled when interacting with al and automated systems: safe and effective systems; algorithmic discrimination protections; data privacy; notice and explanation; and human alternatives, consideration, and fallback39 in january , nist published framework to better manage risks to individuals,  organizations, and  society associated with ai: these complementary frameworks provide useful guidance to researchers as well as important avenues for further research: this strategy identifies randd priorities that can help to instantiate these principles-viewing them as design objectives, system properties, or requirements. centering these principles in the development process is to ensuring that al broadly benefits the american people. the interdisciplinary field of values in design develops methods and approaches to build support and protection for rights and values into sociotechnical systems, or systems that integrate social and technical aspects. the study of ethical, legal, and societal aspects of al is critical because decisions about the use and design of al can require trade-offs between competing values, such as equity, fairness, privacy, and autonomy. these issues are challenging, even outside the realm of al. but al systems bring these concerns to the fore because often do not attempt to model the decision-making processes, including the ethical and legal constraints on them, of humans or organizations, but rather analyze the results of such decision-making processes to develop their own heuristics for decision making: the extent of work in developing al principles and guidelines highlights growing concerns about the ethical, legal, and societal implications of al. ensuring that al can be developed and used in accord with these principles will require an expansive randd program: this strategy divides this randd program along four lines of  effort: making investments in fundamental research to advance core values   through sociotechnical systems design and on the ethical, legal, and societal implications of al; understanding and mitigating social and ethical risks of al; using al to address ethical, legal, and societal issues; and understanding the broader impacts of ai. making investments in fundamental research to advance core values through sociotechnical systems design and on the ethical, legal, and societal implications of al there are several areas in which fundamental research is needed to advance our ability to design values- aligned al systems and to understand the ethical, legal, and societal implications of al. the use of design, in addition to policy, to protect security, accessibility, privacy, and accountability is an active area of research and practice. it moves beyond the retroactive analysis of impacts, developing the tools and  they long- lays key they



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan_ methodologies to reason about how best to protect values through mixed technical and policy choices. research that supports values-aligned design approaches that consider multiple values, rather than one at time, are essential to support the development of safe, equitable, and accountable al systems. technical work on issues such as explainability and interpretability are important to this work, as is technical work on privacy, harmful bias mitigation, and accountable design. for example, with many types of al, such as deep learning models, explainability, and effective auditing of the model are difficult technical problems. resolving the technical problems is only part of the challenge: ensuring that users can make sense of system behavior in context (i.e-, interpretability) is also essential: this is a sociotechnical problem that requires understanding the context in which the model will be operating, the needs and capabilities of the people who require the explanation, and the most effective methods of communicating the explanation: research into communications and psychology finds that individuals generally overestimate how well they understand others' perspectives and how well their communications are understood.  given this reality, interpretability will require fundamental research into communications there is also a need for technical research to develop metrics and frameworks for accountability, fairness, privacy, and bias this includes research into language models and other generative al systems to mitigate  the production of harmful and biased outputs. this must be accompanied by basic social science research into ai governance, which will include understanding how to engage stakeholders most effectively on al issues throughout the al life cycle, establishing legitimacy for al development and implementation  decisions, and performing intersectional research into how different   people and communities understand, interact with, and are impacted by technology: this work must be accompanied by research examining the potential implications of al and developing evaluation and mitigation strategies. this research is needed to inform policy and governance approaches understanding and mitigating social and ethical risks of al there is an immediate need for research to identify effective al governance structures that can mitigate risks, build systems and implement al worthy of public trust, and foster appropriately calibrated public trust in it through effective engagement: one possibility is to study and adapt approaches from other fields, such as medicine, that have robust governance and regulatory ecosystems. for example, institutional review boards for al research to consider al randd's potential harm could be explored: such an ethics, scientific integrity, and society review board could steer the research community away from research questions that pose risks of downstream harm without any clear benefits, and could learn from past engagement with nuanced questions of harm and value tradeoffs similarly, the random control trials, validation, and ongoing monitoring used for drugs and medical devices may provide models for al governance more generally. however, the governance of al will vary depending on the context of use and approaches to validating efficacy and safety vary across sectors in relation to risk: the need for robust governance and oversight structures appropriate to domains of use, which is relevant to all fields of scientific endeavor, is particularly acute in ai as the pathways from ideas to impacts have become especially short: social science research exploring the introduction of al systems into organizations, professions, and fields is necessary to develop a richer understanding of how al alters the production of knowledge, shapes understandings of professional responsibility, shifts accountability across institutional actors, and shapes the relationships between organizations and the populations they serve_ stakeholder engagement can be advanced by studying how to adapt deliberative civic engagement processes to al governance and develop new methods to elicit stakeholder feedback: these social science and regulatory tools can empower communities to weigh in on al's public- and private-sector uses, legal  help



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan_ and ethical issues, and societal implications broadened participation can also promote diversity and equity in shaping data collection, storage, and management practices; developing regulatory oversight  and guidance; and creating equitable policy solutions. finally, randd can determine how best to teach and communicate about al governance structures and sociotechnical approaches for various audiences, be they researchers, research subjects, technologists, policymakers, other stakeholders, or the public as previously stated, a fundamental truth in the field of communications44 is that people overestimate how well they are understood by others there are ethics and scientific integrity requirements in some technology curricula, but it is important to systematically identify and promulgate the most effective ways to integrate these concepts into the learning process to ensure that people have the tools to engage with these issues effectively and consider their actions and decisions in broader contexts. there are other urgent technology issues that require ongoing randd as well. for example, the use of personal data in al systems raises privacy concerns, highlighting the importance of privacy-enhancing technologies such as homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, and secure multiparty computation to mitigate these concerns. there is also a need for tools to identify and mitigate harmful bias across datasets, particularly in new training data: overall, mechanisms to develop, assess, and maintain al systems that mitigate risk and maximize benefit are keenly needed: using al to address ethical, legal, and societal issues al system development; when approached in a manner that mitigates bias and harm and is done in accordance with the civil rights, civil liberties, and interests of those affected by the system, can help address complex societal challenges. properly developed,al can help provide data-driven inputs as society tries to address issues in domains that advance equity, climate change adaptation and mitigation, employment, and healthcare, especially for those traditionally underserved. al often exacerbates bias, but ongoing research has shown that it can also be used to identify and mitigate harmful bias in current practice. different al tools need to be developed and adapted to face the challenges in different domains: the al capabilities needed to optimize healthcare will differ from those needed to address environmental   sustainability: there is also reason for caution in these endeavors, as technology solutionism, where   technological   solutions are advocated for challenges for which may be inappropriate or ineffective, has been problematic in a number of scenarios few general capabilities are needed for al to better be able to help address broader societal issues first, as noted above, al can be used to counter harmful bias. understanding al can reduce inequities stemming from systemic, structural, and individual bias is an important area of research: this would enable a range of analyses of the use of al in managing harmful bias. existing research has shown that some well-known mathematical definitions of bias47 make inherently conflicting recommendations, so an ongoing challenge is developing sociotechnical mechanisms to resolve conflicts in the decision-making pipeline: indeed, research in this area must be sociotechnical, focusing on real world implementations, in particular institutional and regulatory contexts, and account for the   policies,  professional and organizational obligations that structure interactions and reliance between humans and al results second, research is needed to ensure that use of al capabilities advance equity rather than exacerbating inequity: for example, if wealthy hospitals can take advantage of al systems, the benefits of these technologies will not be equitably distributed: research to make beneficial al accessible in historically underrepresented communities will help ensure that those in greatest need of these capabilities can use them. this research will include making al capabilities affordable and ensuring that al is understood and can be integrated into existing systems.  they how only



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan_ many historically underrepresented communities may not be represented in datasets typically used to train al systems, nor included in development processes. this limits the ability of these communities to benefit from the al systems. while noteworthy efforts are being made to connect with a broader set of communities, additional research is needed to identify these types of gaps and address them more fully: finally, there is an international dimension to these challenges. for truly global concerns (e.g-, pandemics), international approaches are needed, as discussed in strategy . in addition to the concerns about access and serving the underserved, al that can be adapted to societies with different legal, ethical, and political commitments while respecting human rights and democratic values is essential: understanding the broader impacts of al al promises to bring vast changes to society. while many of those changes will be positive, there are likely to be negative consequences, and these impacts are also likely to be unequally distributed: randd in the ethical, legal, and societal implications of al is needed to understand, anticipate, and mitigate harm as well as understanding the distribution of likely benefits large-scale research into sociotechnical feedback loops, using the tools of systems engineering and complexity theory, is needed to understand how al interacts with society. this includes the systematic study of the tradeoffs in societal benefits and risks of using in different permutations, or not using al in each context:  one specific area that requires this approach is the future of work. there has been some attention to the future of work, the potential for al to displace workers, and the need to retrain workers for a rapidly changing economy. there is also a need to understand what al does to workplaces and how it impacts work safety and overall well-being:  this is especially needed with the growing popularity and abilities of generative al systems. similar inquiry is needed across social institutions, such as research into how al will change how patients experience the healthcare system and how students are educated: finally, randd is needed to identify means to counter malicious uses of al, for example the generation of deep fakes and manipulation of social media.  here, there may be technical responses, but sociotechnical study is needed as well: the information integrity research and development interagency working group (iwg) recently published recommendations, which will in turn require innovative approaches to implement in future al systems51  using, too,



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan strategy : ensure the safety and security of ai systems while al systems offer promise in providing performance improvements in several different applications, their increased complexity, rapidly evolving technology base, and significant data needs can lead to increased risks derived from their deployment. the result is an emerging emphasis on the safety and security of al systems, which requires an inherently interdisciplinary approach: for the purposes of this strategy, to appropriately discuss the needs surrounding these risks, the terms ""safety"" and ""security"" will carry the definitions laid out in the ""assessing and improving al trustworthiness: current contexts and concerns"" workshop report, which defines safety as mitigating against a system producing new harm, and security as monitoring a system's integrity: this usage is consistent with the nist al rmf. critical areas for research focus include the development of testing methods that can scale with the increasing demands of modern al systems and complex systems-of-systems, and improved methods ensuring the security of al systems against input data manipulation, model inversion, and other forms of adversarial attack: ultimately, a combination of additional investment in standards, systems, and research is needed to calibrate trust in the performance of deployed al systems. to this strategy is addressing the fundamental question of what level of testing is sufficient to ensure the safety and security ofnon-deterministic and/or not fully explainable systems before their deployment: the process of securing and making safe al, as discussed in the first national al randd strategic plan and the  update, must be incorporated in all stages of the al system life cycle, from the initial design and data/model building to verification and validation, deployment, operation, and monitoring: ""safety by design"" must therefore be an important part of the al randd portfolio, particularly as models are increasingly used by non-technical users and incorporated across broad range of platforms and applications adopting al systems thatare unsafe or insecure will potentially lead to harm, and uncertainty about the safety and security of these systems will stymie al adoption (as discussed in strategy ). standards setting (discussed in depth in strategy ) is critical in the effort to develop safe and secure al; it requires research into how effective and meaningful standards can be developed and adapted to the broad array of applications in which ae will be used: this strategy divides the safety and security randd program along two lines of effort: building safe al and securing ai: building safe al as al becomes commonplace and its applications proliferate, the need for a national approach to research on al and safety becomes increasingly urgent: this research includes developing methods for creating, evaluating, deploying, and monitoring al that are focused on safety: with datasets and models growing larger and more complex, there is an urgent need for solutions that can scale with these larger systems additionally, there is a need for a national innovation ecosystem53 that can democratize the tools for accessing a= models at this scale, making analysis of such large models accessible to the broader community and beyond the groups that are capable of investing in the infrastructure to develop and deploy them. this approach would enable a larger field of researchers to address safety and security concerns relating to these larger models, including those related to bias, accuracy, and functionality: more research is needed to develop safe human-machine interactions. exploration of new formal methods could characterize boundaries of behavior and bring much-needed rigor to safety-critical al algorithms and applications. these techniques include novel programming languages and compilers to  for key -



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan develop more robust formal verification techniques for al systems that could provide assurances of safety, and neurosymbolic programming that could bridge the areas of deep learning and program synthesis. addressing al systems-of-systems, in which the al system is only one component of a larger system, or large system composed of many al and classical subsystems, is one of the most pressing challenges in testing systems at scale: methods and approaches need to be developed to independently verify subsystems within the context of their operating framework and to evaluate the performance of the overall construct to ensure that the ensemble will operate safely, and that security of the overall  system is not harmed by subsystem interactions. new testbeds and prototyping facilities could enable this area of research: long-term risks remain, including the existential risk associated with the development of artificial general intelligence through self-modifying al or other means other long-term risks are related to the possible deep entangling of al systems into all parts of daily life and systems, which may cause large-scale societal or environmental issues that are currently difficult or impossible to predict; or specification gaming, whereby an al system gradually learns to achieve   numerical requirements but   somehow avoids accomplishing the desired task these risks are difficult to quantify currently and need additional research. securing al the national need for secure al is growing as software and systems are growing more complex but also increasing our collective vulnerability to cybersecurity threats55 this is echoed in both the desire for additional training among practitioners within government agencies, and in the recognition of al security as an independent field of study adjacent to cybersecurity and al. such a field is needed to address the many open questions still surrounding the multifaceted issues of al security, such as the need for appropriate metrics for alignment, protection against adversarial attack, scalable methods, and trade-offs between interpretability and accuracy: adversarial al includes ""data poisoning;' in which al training or input data are manipulated, and other forms of adversarial attacks against al, such as targeting systems linked to the al or manipulating objects in the physical world. changes to audio or visual data that cannot be perceived by humans can change how an al system processes data: this is particularly salient for ml systems. some of these risks can be identified through red teaming, where trusted partners act as adversaries in a simulated compromise attempt, and other risks can be mitigated through mathematical modeling: research is needed to better enable both approaches an additional threat to al systems is the existing al-development supply chain as only a few tools are currently used for al system development and deployment; there is a risk that these tools could present vehicle for systems to be compromised: efforts   should be made to protect these tools   from manipulation, and to develop a more robust toolset to protect the al-development supply chain. research into improved methods for ensuring the security of al systems is critical, including work on improving the capability of systems against input data manipulation, model inversion, and other forms of adversarial attack. the many-against-one nature of an al system's vulnerability needs to be addressed, as al systems open more pathways for disruption that most systems. only one needs to be successful, while the al system must protect against all.   al, goal



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan strategy : develop shared public datasets and environments for ai training and testing progress in al is increasingly linked to data and computation. the availability of well-purposed (i.e: legally, and ethically collected and managed) data al training and testing enables research applications, scientific  discovery, and operational  efficiencies a well-designed cyberinfrastructure can aid data federation, support metadata, track provenance, and enable reproducibility: similarly, access to advanced computing, including hpc, edge  computing, cloud resources, traditional desktop computing, and emerging computing paradigms, drives al innovation. at the same time, the challenges for researchers to access at-scale data and computing resources continue to pose significant obstacles for the field. for example, many al researchers are departing academia for industry settings where such resources are more readily available: similarly, with resources concentrated in large technology companies and well- resourced universities, the divide between those with access and those without has the potential to adversely skew al research: researchers who lack access to rigorous data and computation will simply not be competitive. with the goal of democratizing access to at-scale al data and compute resources, the nairr task force has published a roadmap and implementation plan for a national research cyberinfrastructure that would connect researchers to data, computation, testbeds, and associated training59 the work of the nairr task force builds on other efforts to enhance access to these diverse resources. for example, since their introduction in ,the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (fair) guiding principles6 for data have seen tremendous acceptance by the scientific research community: in , the open government data act61 mandated that the federal government; through collaboration and coordination, provide open data, engage in  evidence-building activities, enhance statistical   efficiency, uphold confidential information protection, and, where data is about humans, respect privacy: this strategy is divided into four lines of effort: developing and making accessible datasets to meet the needs of a diverse spectrum of al applications; developing shared large-scale and specialized advanced computing and hardware resources; making testing resources responsive to commercial and public interests; and developing open-source software libraries and toolkits. developing and making accessible datasets to meet the needs of a diverse spectrum of al applications sustaining access to well-purposed training and testing datasets is crucial for ensuring scientifically reliable, reproducible, ethical, and equitable results. while there is value in simplified and synthetic datasets for  algorithm research, development, and testing, other datasets must be  sufficiently representative to effectively tackle challenging, real-world  problems: dataset documentation must include data provenance and references to previous work with the data. these will facilitate the ability of researchers to compare multiple datasets generated by the same system or process and clearly describe changes in the system that  yield any differences in the data. the technical and sociotechnical infrastructure necessary to support   reproducible research has been   recognized as an important challenge-and is essential to al systems as well: the current infrastructure and the level of documentation and curation of datasets are mostly inadequate and vary significantly by research area_  for



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan machine learning applications need their training data to be integrated, cleaned, and refined in order to be usable. specific, detailed user and system requirements, methods by which the data were collected, and any factors (e.g , sensor noise) that lead to noise or other artifacts in the data will drive how the data can be made ""ready"" for use in al applications (strategy ). as with computational infrastructure and testbeds, data infrastructure needs to be designed to meet the specific demands of al applications. the infrastructure should be developed with community input and continually re-evaluated and updatedas technology advancesandthe research problems and endeavors evolve. many government datasets are already available to researchers and students on various websites and platforms (e.g;, substantial national aeronautics and space administration [nasa] earth science datasets are available through nasa's distributed active archive centers62), though not all are well known, easy to find, or easy to use.,  for example, the different processes by which government data and government-funded data are publicly available or licensed for external use can be confusing and time consuming to navigate. easing access to federal government data, when appropriate, can increase the use of existing resources for developing and studying al.  this includes potential benefits from creating agreements, templates, or processes for data access that can be shared across agencies so that researchers and students no longer face an array of different requirements to access to different datasets. government data are often suitable for inclusion in standardized training datasetsand benchmarks within the al research community: when appropriate, agencies may identify opportunities to share data across agency boundaries or contribute agency data to standardized resources that have the potential for widespread usage by researchers and practitioners. likewise, the development of better methods for moving data and computing closer together is important, as these methods decrease the costs and time associated with analysis. for example, the national institutes of health (nih) sandt research infrastructure discovery, experimentation, and sustainability (strides) initiative67 enables access to rich datasets and advanced computational infrastructure; tools, and services. this can involve investment in federated and distributed learning approaches and supporting infrastructure (a potential crosscut with strategy ) and support of federation of data archives that increasingly make use of cloud services: this includes improving data access and facilitating use of ml and other data analytics methods: as needed, because of privacy or security, the federal government can provide secure platforms for access to government data, as the national geospatial-intelligence agency and the department of defense's chief data and artificial intelligence office have done, and as is envisioned for the recently authorized national secure data service demonstration. data providers also may be able to make otherwise confidential data available through removal of some information not critical to analytics, as is done with nasa's commercial aviation data. such data access also requires having identity access management in place: alongside easing access to data is making data more discoverable and usable: there is a research need for exploring rational methods for linking related datasets, such as the development of open knowledge7o for data discovery and compilation across sources and users. in addition, increasing capabilities for and public access to synthetic data generation can be helpful when corresponding real data cannot be made available because of privacy concerns or because they are available only in small quantities. other means by which to increase the amount of useful data, such as crowdsourcing and active learning to increase the number of labels, should also be considered: thoughtful investment may be necessary to supplement existing datasets through the careful collection of more representative data (for example, the all of us research program at nih, which has focused participant enrollment to ensure large percentage includes individuals who have been traditionally under- represented in biomedical research71). these resources can be made available more easily and in greater  many gain for graphs



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan quantity through the use of public-private partnerships: this requires investment in additional mechanisms to facilitate collaborations with the private sector through funding and novel mechanisms that allow academia, non-government organizations (ngos), and other researchers to use private-sector and public-sector resources. additionally, government or government-funded data should account for historically underrepresented communities and groups underrepresented in data: for example, support is needed to generate natural language processing tools for underrepresented languages and those that do not have a written form datasets also need to document context (e.g-, labeling process and sample bias) to be useful, in part by encouraging the capture of metadata that can be computationally queried and assessed. depending on the problem, additional effort may be needed to capture sociological and contextual information and to enhance secure and privacy-preserving data linkages between informative data assets. computer science and data experts in government may need to engage social scientists and other relevant experts in this process: an important part ofthe government provision of data for al is ensuring their use in a manner that reflects american values (a crosscut with strategy ). for example, it is critical to advance both technological and governance methods that preserve privacy, including protecting against  revelations of personally identifiable information when publicly available government data are combined with other data. there also is a need for research on effective data governance that allows releasing data under secure platforms that control access to or removal of content: beyond ensuring that al does not result in harm from the release of personally identifiable information, there is also a public need to demonstrate how datasets can help overcome inequities this could include creating curated datasets for analysis of past inequities, such as digitizing redline"" maps originally developed by the home owners loan corporation in the 1930s. this analysis can be used to avoid replicating disparities, and can help increase access to safe and sanitary housing combined with flood maps. developing shared large-scale and specialized advanced computing and hardware resources innovation in al is dependent not just on data, but also on access to advanced computing: large universities, federal laboratories, and private-sector firms often have access to such capability, which can take the form of hpc, cloud, hybrid, and/or emerging systems: but many researchers and students at smaller institutions of higher education, minority-serving institutions, community colleges, secondary schools, and startups and small businesses may have less access or fewer resources to purchase the computing needed to conduct al randd. to lower barriers to entry into ai randd, enhanced access to advanced computational resources is necessary, particularly for the variety of new users who otherwise would face financial, logistical, or capacity challenges to engaging in the al research ecosystem: expanded access should be provided by leveraging existing resources in all sectors, augmenting the capacity of federally provided resources as appropriate, creating new research computing infrastructure to serve the al randd community, and providing financial support where needed. to this end, the nairr task force has put forward a roadmap and implementation plan leading to a mix of computational resources (i.e , on-premises and commercial cloud, dedicated, and shared resources) with a range of central processing unit (cpu) and graphics processing unit (gpu) options with multiple accelerators per node, high-speed networking, and sufficient memory capacity:  being



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan making testing resources responsive to commercial and public interests the growing complexity of al systems has created a need for equally robust al testing resources in many cases, these resources are developed alongside the technology itself by private industry or the research community at large. however, this approach to al testing leaves certain concerns unaddressed. first, novel al research often experiences limited testing because of difficulties with replication. second, al systems developed by private industry often do not have mechanisms for public qualitative evaluation  and testing: finally, for research institutions or private industry, certain areas of testing, especially surrounding large-scale al models, are not economical to pursue in isolation, and these areas are left underexplored as a result: federal al testing resources, primarily in the form of testbeds and testing frameworks, can address the limitations of existing testing paradigms for example, the nist facial recognition vendor test (frvt)  helps provide insight into the accuracy of otherwise private facial recognition algorithms, and the guaranteeing al robustness against deception program at the defense advanced research projects agency supports novel testing mechanisms in ml security by means of a virtual testbed, toolbox, and benchmarking dataset. similar approaches could be employed for other common al applications, including voice-assistant software and recommender systems expanding the scope of federal testing resources is critical to the healthy adoption of emerging al systems as agencies develop new testbeds, both foundational al and application-specific al should be considered: in addition, new testing efforts may also inform (or conversely, be contingent on) emerging al standards and benchmarks awareness and coordination between these efforts is likely to improve the efficacy of both. finally, because of the rapid rate of al randd, test framework designers should pay close attention to changing trends in software, hardware, and research focus to plan for the longevity of their work: developing open-source software libraries and toolkits another area for government investment involves providing access to and support for open al software libraries access to and continued support for libraries and toolkits can accelerate randd, from conducting fundamental research through facilitating technology translation, as the same libraries may be used for a wide range of services, including commercial ones the growth in open software libraries and toolkits has enabled a corresponding growth in al applications and skills. researchers and students across sectors use open-source tool sets. government agencies also develop open software libraries and toolsets specific to mission needs in which industry lacks market incentives to develop the products for the government or other sectors. agencies and agency-funded researchers make code available through github or other commonly used commercial platforms that provide resources for researchers and students. also, prior to commercial interest, the federal government may need to incentivize continued development, maintenance, and curation of software and tools to prevent them from becoming outdated: as an example, nsf' s pathways to enable open-source ecosystems program aims to harness the power of open- source development for the creation of new technology solutions to problems of national and societal importance:  many



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan strategy : measure and evaluate ai systems through standards and benchmarks standards, benchmarks, testbeds, and their adoption by the al community are essential for guiding and promoting randd on al systems, and the recognition of this role continues to rise in the united states and  globally: both the  executive order on maintaining american leadership in artificial intelligence- and the naiia7 explicitly call out the importance of standards in addition, the international organization for standardization (iso) and the international electrotechnical commission (iec) have convened a joint technical subcommittee on al (iso/iec joint technical committee , subcommittee  on artificial intelligence79) to develop standards and associated considerations for al systems. the surge in al-related standards activities has outpaced the launch of new al-focused benchmarks and evaluations, particularly as related to the trustworthiness of al systems. considerations of fairness and bias in benchmark datasets have become increasingly important. much more plentiful are benchmarks that test the application-level performance of al algorithms (e.g-, false-positive or false-negative rates for classification algorithms) and benchmarks that quantify the compute-level performance of al software and hardware systems these efforts need to be expanded to sociotechnical evaluations of al systems and assessing the broader impact of al technologies assessing, promoting, and providing assurances on all aspects of al trustworthiness require measuring and evaluating al technology performance through benchmarks and standards. beyond safe, secure, reliable, resilient; interpretable, and transparent, trustworthy al must preserve privacy while detecting and avoiding inappropriate bias. claims of trustworthiness and compliance must also be verifiable and certifiable. as al systems evolve, so will the need to develop new metrics and testing requirements for validation of these essential characteristics. the evaluation, standards, and benchmarks of al systems need to acknowledge underrepresentation of certain communities, and approaches are required to solve this issue theoretically and practically. there is need to proactively identify underrepresented communities, including indigenous groups, and to include diverse stakeholders and domain experts from government; academia, the private sector, and civil society, including representatives from differently sized organizations and lower- and middle-income socioeconomic groups and countries, to ensure fairness and prevent bias in the development of standards and benchmarks. it is necessary to develop standard ways to measure, test, and report the potential societal effects of  commonly used datasets such as imagenet: a_ user-friendly acknowledgment of privacy considerations regarding an organization'$ collection, use,and sharing of personal information as well as a label of ethical assurance could help promote trustworthy al systems: a potential example of a voluntary program that effectively fosters trust based on standards-based assessments is the leadership in energy and environmental design program for building certifications  this strategy divides the areas in which additional progress must be made along five lines: developing a broad spectrum of al standards; establishing al technology benchmarks; increasing the availability of al testbeds; engaging the al community in standards and benchmarks; and developing standards for auditing and monitoring of al systems developing a broad spectrum of al standards the development of standards must be hastened to keep pace with the rapidly evolving capabilities and expanding domains of al applications. standards provide requirements, specifications, guidelines, or characteristics that can be used consistently to ensure that al systems meet critical objectives  being for



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan functionality and interoperability, and that perform reliably and safely throughout their operational lifecycle. there is a need to achieve consensus-based provision of precise definitions of technical terms and consistent terminology (e.g-, al, autonomy, transparency, explainability, and interpretability) within the domain of safety and security: adoption of standards brings credibility to technological advancements and facilitates an expanded interoperable marketplace. one example of an al-relevant standard that has been developed-by the institute of electrical and electronics engineers--is p1872- (standard ontologies for robotics and automation): this standard provides a systematic way of representing knowledge and a common set of terms and definitions. these allow for unambiguous knowledge transfer among humans, robots, and other artificial systems. another example of an al-relevant standard is iso/iec . (information technology_artificial intelligence_artificial intelligence concepts and terminology), developed within iso/iec joint technical committee  sc , which defines terminology and concepts related to ai: additional work in al standards development is needed across all subdomains of al: for example, there should be support for an open knowledge network standard to address the limitations of current deep , learning systems = as part of the naiia, congress directed nist to develop an al risk management framework, a voluntary tool that organizations can use to evaluate, assess, and manage risks that may result from the use of al. the framework leverages standards and best practices that organizations can use to achieve stated outcomes: further support is needed for research initiatives that tackle questions related to understanding and operationalizing the risks and harms of applications of al systems so that risk ratings, certifications, and insurance become feasible for al systems. one of the challenges to developing standards in new areas is achieving sufficient shared understanding of the underlying issues necessary for the standards to serve useful purposes additional efforts are needed to inform and create standards that support the following: software engineering to manage system complexity, sustainment, and security, and to monitor and control emergent behaviors: functionality and trustworthiness to assess an al system's validity and reliability, safety, security and resilience, privacy,  interpretability, and bias as well as the tradeoff  among the mentioned trustworthiness characteristics metrics to quantify factors impacting performance and compliance with standards. safety to evaluate risk management and hazard analysis of systems, human-computer interactions, control systems, and regulatory compliance. usability to ensure that interfaces and controls are effective, efficient, and intuitive: interoperability to define interchangeable components, data, and transaction models via standard and compatible interfaces. security to address the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information, and cybersecurity: privacy to control for the protection of information while being processed, when in transit, or while being stored or used: fairness and interpretability to ensure that al systems' harmful bias is managed and able to help humans understand their operation and outputs.  they key



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan flexibility to avoid a rigid lock-in that may lead to workarounds, lack of compliance, and otherharmful spillover effects. international collaborations to that can support responsible al development and thoughtful policy both domestically and abroad: traceability to provide a record of events (their implementation, testing, and completion), and to curate data: domains to define use-inspired standard lexicons and corresponding frameworks for example, consider the domains of healthcare and manufacturing: in the united states, nearly $ trillion is spent on healthcare each year, and healthcare data today are fragmented, often incomplete, and difficult to access_ this   limits al capabilities in healthcare: a significant improvement to ai algorithms--for safety, reliability, and trust-~can be obtained through improvements to data access, standards for metadata that capture important social characteristics, and a balance that achieves privacy for the individual and enables ethical, legal, and societal validation. manufacturing is a major contributor to the u.s. economy, and research is needed on data standards for al in manufacturing  with the  passage of the chips and science act of , there will be an expanded role for al in semiconductor design and manufacturing, where standards will aid in further innovation: impact assessments can expose preventable harm, encourage consultation with affected communities, and standardize the information available for further research about which al systems are used in which contexts and for what purposes the development of methodological standards for these assessments is especially critical for ensuring that impact assessments are done in the public interest, and for preventing the proliferation of assessments that manipulate or obscure harmful impacts of applications of al systems. finally, the real-world performance and energy efficiency of al models remain poorly quantified. one recent study found that the carbon footprint of a large language model nearly doubled when equipment manufacturing and idle consumption during training were taken into account. development and adoption of standards, including the documentation of hardware and training details, may allow better management of the nuances of the environmental performance of al, which in turn, informs its responsible use_ establishing al technology benchmarks benchmarks, comprising tests and evaluations, provide quantitative, qualitative, or mixed method measures for developing standards and assessing compliance to standards. benchmarks drive innovation by promoting advancements aimed at addressing strategically selected scenarios; additionally provide objective data to track the evolution of al science and technologies to effectively evaluate al systems, relevant and effective testing methodologies and metrics must be developed and standardized. standard testing methods will prescribe protocols and procedures for assessing, comparing, and managing the functionality and trustworthiness of al systems. standard metrics are needed to define measures to characterize al systems, including, but not limited to accuracy, complexity, trust and competency, risk and uncertainty, explainability and interpretability, unintended bias, comparison to human performance, and economic impact: it is important to note that benchmarks are driven by data. research needs to be done on how to construct benchmarks that test for more than accuracy under assumptions that data are independent and identically distributed. strategy  discusses the importance of datasets for training and testing:  they



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan_ frequently, al performance is evaluated using only a handful of typical metrics (e.g-, accuracy, precision): while these metrics are useful for development; they do not provide end-to-end contextual information: for instance, for al systems developed to improve maintenance, metrics associated with repair times and overall system availability will be more informative than the accuracy of a maintenance action prediction: hence, testing should also use metrics that are operationally relevant to the use context for an al system. further, datasets used should be dynamic in the sense that they should be enhanced by new data and connected to domain problems with human committees and evaluators, not just provide metrics numbers. while prior efforts provide a strong foundation for driving al benchmarking forward, they are limited by being domain-specific: additional standards, testbeds, and benchmarks are needed across a broader range of domains to ensure that al solutions are broadly applicable and widely adopted. the federal government should validate and collate evaluations created by independent researchers to create catalog of approved tests for deployed models and those in development: it is useful to emphasize characterizing performance across use conditions; an al system can be deployed with constraints that limit it from working in conditions where its performance is degraded, or it is more likely to do harm: increasing the availability of al testbeds as noted in one recent report: ""testbeds are essential so that researchers can use actual operational data "" to model and run experiments on real-world system[s] and scenarios in good test environments. while some al testbeds exist, adequate testbeds are needed across all areas of al. as an example, although the federal government has massive amounts of unique and mission-sensitive data, many of these data cannot be distributed to the extramural research community. appropriate programs should be established for academic and industrial researchers to conduct research within secured and curated testbed environments established by federal agencies al models and experimental methods can be shared and validated by researchers if have access to these test environments, affording al scientists, engineers, and students unique research opportunities not otherwise available. it is necessary to create standardized testing frameworks and benchmarks that allow for effective evaluation of al systems to ensure that they are performing appropriately for a given use case in a way that is fair, safe, secure, and reliable, as well as to develop new tools for test; evaluation, validation, verification, and monitoring-and to assure the reliability of al systems over their full domain of use and life cycle: a_ nairr, as outlined by the nairr task force, would support this goal. engaging the al community in standards and benchmarks government leadership and coordination are needed to support standardization and encourage its widespread use in government, academia, and industry: the al community_comprising government; academia, industry, and civil society, including end users--~must be energized to participate in developing standards and benchmark programs as each government agency engages the community in different ways based on its role and mission, community interactions can be leveraged through coordination to strengthen their impact: this coordination is needed to collectively gather user-driven requirements, anticipate developer-driven standards, marshal the expertise of the al randd community, and promote educational opportunities. user-driven requirements shape the objectives and design of challenge problems and enable technology evaluation. community benchmarks allow randd to define progress, close gaps, and drive innovative solutions for specific problems these benchmarks must include methods for defining and assigning ground truth: the creation of benchmark simulation and analysis tools will also accelerate al developments. the results of these benchmarks will help match the right technology to the  they



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan user's need, forming objective criteria for standards compliance, qualified product lists, and potential source selection: industry and academia are the primary sources for emerging al systems. promoting and coordinating randd subject matter expert participation in standards and benchmarking activities are critical. as solutions emerge, opportunities abound for anticipating developer- and user-driven standards through sharing common visions for technical architectures, developing reference implementations of emerging standards to show feasibility, and conducting precompetitive testing to ensure high-quality and interoperable solutions, and to develop best practices for technology applications. al practitioners carry critical domain expertise on testbeds for al, and their expectations can play a major role in developing al systems: as a result, it is crucial to broaden al education to a variety of industries and encourage the al community to further engage in standards development for evaluating al systems. furthermore, it is even more crucial to bridge the gap between practitioners' expectations and al researchers to achieve a harmonious development between al technology developers and users it is also important to collaborate with industry consortia and affected communities developing and adopting standards, as well as participating in benchmark activities, comes with a cost, and randd organizations engage in these activities when they see significant benefit: updating acquisition processes across agencies to include specific requirements for al standards in requests proposals will encourage communities to further engage in standards development and adoption community-based benchmarks such as the text retrieval conference9 and frvt91 also lower barriers and strengthen incentives by providing types of training and testing data otherwise inaccessible, fostering healthy competition between technology developers to drive best-of-breed algorithms, and enabling objective and comparative performance metrics for relevant source selections there is also a need for improved testing methodologies and resources that would allow agencies to directly evaluate cloud-hosted al capabilities: developing standards for auditing and monitoring of al systems al systems will need to be properly audited and regularly monitored to identify and mitigate risks, both technical (e.g , accuracy, reliability, and robustness) and sociotechnical (e.g , bias and privacy): there are many unresolved research questions about how to effectively audit and monitor al systems, and the scalability of auditing is emerging as a significant practical challenge: as al systems proliferate and find their way into more realms of human activity, it is imperative to develop scalable auditing techniques, create new types of qualitative analysis tools, train enough people to carry them out, receive feedback from humans in the and build institutional capacity in government and industry to undertake, oversee, and respond to audits.  cycle for loop,



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan strategy : better understand the national ai rd workforce needs rapid advancements in al continually impact the workforce by creating a growing demand for qualified computer and information science professionals and for new skills in the broader workforce now or soon using al systems daily: within the united states, computer and information science positions are projected to grow by  percent between  and . private industry is expected to lead this demand with its sustained financial support and access to advanced computing facilities and datasets  the resulting economic growth could be large: al research is expected to contribute as much as $. trillion in cumulative growth across g2o countries alone over the same period. fortunately, interest in al study and careers remains high: however, u.s. academic institutions are struggling to keep pace with the explosive growth in student interest and enrollment in al. furthermore, while booming enrollments are common at the undergraduate level in al-related fields such as computer science, doctoral enrollment trends show steady decreases in u.s. citizen and permanent resident enrollments. this has impacts on the al workforce, particularly in government positions such as those requiring security clearances. overall, these trends put an onus on government to better understand workforce needs and take steps to develop and support al talent; with the goal of creating a sustainable ai workforce for government; academia, and  industry: moreover, the trends in computing and information science need to be complemented by those in other disciplinary areas that also contribute to al discovery and innovation, such as the social and behavioral sciences, economics, and systems engineering: this strategy is divided into ten lines of effort: describing and evaluating the al workforce; developing strategies for al instructional material at all levels; supporting al higher education staff; training/retraining the workforce; exploring the impact of diverse and multidisciplinary expertise; identifying and attracting the world's best talent; developing regional al expertise; investigating options to strengthen the federal al workforce; incorporating ethical, legal, and societal implications into al education and training; and communicating federal workforce priorities to external stakeholders. describing and evaluating the al workforce the national al randd strategic plan:  update described some elements of the al workforce, marking it interdisciplinary, dynamic, and data-centric, and called for ""additional studies on the current and future national workforce needs for al randd."" much work remains to adequately and accurately define who makes up the ""al workforce"" _including their demographics--and what those persons need to know and do. moreover, given the dynamic nature of the al field, this analysis must be redone periodically to keep pace with changes in al and the workforce: data on the current al workforce, including its participants, their roles and tasks, and the knowledge and skills required to perform these tasks, is critical to properly understanding the workforce's abilities, gaps, and needs. with extensive, properly prepared, and well-ordered data, the united states can reliable clarity on the status quo of the al workforce: clarifying the understanding and priorities for a strong al workforce in the united states will help focus efforts and investments across sectors. further, illuminating the demographic disparities and gaps in the al workforce will provide policymakers and human resource professionals with information necessary to address these disparities and increase equity and diversity: facilitating this work could provide incentives for employers in various sectors to improve their data collection methods, consolidate existing workforce datasets, and support the creation of a modernized labor database. research necessary to facilitate and reinforce this effort should focus on developing  gain



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan proper data, knowledge and skills, and workforce curation and analysis techniques, including the enterprise and architectural needs of a modernized workforce: the chips and science act of  takes a step in this direction by authorizing nsf to generate a study of us universities that conduct high-impact al research to better understand what factors enable al progress. in particular, the report should contain information about university computing power, dataset availability, specialized curricula, faculty and graduate students, sources of federal and non-federal research funding, and industry and other partnerships, with the intention of implementing successful practices across the academic ecosystem such a study could help ensure that al workforce needs such as adequate resources and institutional support are well-understood and integrated with complementary workforce needs such as beneficial training and skills. developing strategies for al instructional material at all levels the united states would benefit from making al research accessible to wide range of americans moreover, exposing students at all levels, starting at the primary and secondary levels, to al and data science prepares them for successful integration into a world that is rapidly adopting al. high-quality, domain-specific, and appropriately challenging lessons are needed for introducing students to critical thinking skills that will help them understand and evaluate al systems. the research required to properly identify and curate the right content for a given area and level of study requires considerable effort: further research is needed to sort out the best pedagogy and media through which to convey this content, as well as to identify and curate best practices for training instructors it is important to facilitate the engagement of other public- and private-sector entities in this research and ensure demographic and cultural equity in that engagement additionally, it is important that any al materials, training programs, or systems are accessible, equitably promulgated, and broadly representative, especially given current inequalities among students' and educators access to resources_ supporting al higher education staff at the most advanced levels, some al researchers in university positions (e.g-, tenured or tenure-track faculty) are moving toward industry randd. workforce efforts should also study opportunities to ensure a sufficient university workforce to educate future generations of the al workforce in two-vear and four- colleges and universities, spanning associate'$, bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree programs: these efforts could include joint appointments enabling faculty to engage across sectors. training/retraining the workforce similarly, there are opportunities to upskill individuals who will be using al systems in their current lines of work. to do so, the federal government must prioritize developing programs and systems that support the identification and recruitment of al talent and the assessment, training, and validation of al skills and knowledge: these programs and systems should leverage al to maximize their relevance and impact: they should instill standardization, interoperability, and democratization. once developed, these programs and systems will continue to foster the development of al-competent workforce and support personnel displaced by al deployment: pursuant to this, research partnerships among government; academia, and industry must be cultivated: these partnerships should prioritize creating on-demand courses that benefit from the best pedagogy and oversight available to a diverse workforce. these courses must be equitably and accessibly available to all:  vear



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan_ additionally, rapid and well-informed development of grand challenges for worker training and retraining programs and  systems should be  explored: grand challenges are an exceptional  joint research, development, and acquisition method that allows the government to leverage its  partnerships, technologies, and other assets to tackle hard problems such as workforce development: exploring the impact of diverse and multidisciplinary expertise safe and equitable al development and deployment requires a broad understanding of the people and places affected by al as much as deep technical knowledge of the al itself. multidisciplinary education across diverse fields can be beneficial for ensuring fair and equitable access to information and opportunity, democratization of new and emerging technologies, and the development of a diverse marketplace of ideas around technology use and development: moreover, al must be developed and managed from a holistic perspective that integrates knowledge from various disciplines and backgrounds to foster an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach that considers the needs of all americans. as such, hiring for teams that make and/or use al should emphasize diversity from academic, professional,  and experiential perspectives. to facilitate this approach, federal researchers should leverage their unique position and perspective to spearhead research into the roles and impacts of different areas of study on the realities and future of al: as a result, researchers will understand how to engage diverse perspectives and align their efforts and resources with national needs and priorities, as well as across all sectors: these actions should be taken in addition to other efforts to increase the diversity of communities, identities, races, ethnicities, backgrounds, abilities, cultures, and beliefs involved in al randd. the federal research community should prioritize research on the best way to increase demographic and cultural representation in the federal al workforce_ identifying and attracting the world's best talent the united states is home to an abundance of talent in many areas but has historically relied on foreign- born talent to bolster its technology workforce-especially in randd in emerging technologies half of the current al experts in u.s. academia and industry were born outside of the united states.,, federal resources can support university, industry, and civil society efforts to host visiting students and scholars with pathways to u.s. citizenship. fostering international partnerships with foreign governments and universities in support of strategy  also serves to address this strategy: developing regional al expertise the size and diversity of the united states makes it useful to synthesize inputs and expertise from various parts of the country: leveraging different geographical regions can facilitate equitable and broad dispersion of al training and the economic opportunities, while also accessing a diversity of represented perspectives for contribution and feedback. in addition, by coordinating geographically concentrated resources such as data and computing infrastructure, a highly skilled local workforce, and complementary industry presence (e.g,, cybersecurity, data science) , regional synergies could foster local participation in the al-enabled economy, facilitate high-quality al training, and accelerate al research progress at the national level: in complementary fashion, federal efforts should be directed toward fostering regional efforts that enable access to the al economy in historically underserved areas, including in rural areas and on tribal lands. 



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan such efforts will ensure that opportunities are provided to a broad array of americans, allowing al research efforts to draw upon diverse perspectives that may be underrepresented in current efforts. investigating options to strengthen the federal al workforce the federal government should fund and execute research efforts to determine the feasibility of different options for strengthening the federal al workforce federal efforts could accelerate and leverage the growing number of al k- education and workforce development programs to build partnerships among government; academia, and industry, helping to recruit and train early-career private-sector professionals and traditional students to engage with federal agencies in the areas of digital transformation, data management, analytics, and al. such partnerships could potentially also include rotations and/or work in local, state, and federal government organizations, accelerating and supporting the deployment of al across the public sector. efforts to strengthen the federal al workforce should include a focus on training federal al professionals so they are able to design systems that support the rights and safety of the public and mitigate the residual risks to them: along these lines, the al training act directs the federal government to develop and provide an al training program a substantial portion of the federal al workforce the chips and science act of  authorizes nsf to study and establish a federal al scholarship-for-service program to recruit and train the next generation of al professionals across the federal government: it also clarifies that individuals studying al-related topics are eligible for the existing nsf cybercorps: scholarships for service program, enabling the program to begin specifically recruiting individuals with an interest in applying al skills to federal projects in the future: incorporating ethical, legal, and societal implications into al education and training the ethical, legal, and societal implications of al have become increasingly salient in recent years and will continue to be so. as such, it is vital for those who develop, use, and oversee al systems to be conversant in these topics and committed to upholding the associated values. experts are needed who are conversant in these issues and in data science and al systems, and who can help educate the workforce and inform education and upskilling curricula. also needed are policy, law, and governance experts who are conversant in the ethical, legal, societal, and technological aspects of al topics unfortunately, current academic programs that create qualified experts in any one of these three areas are challenged to offer education in the others. to address this challenge, the federal government should support undergraduate and graduate programs, as well as postdoctoral opportunities that designed to build interdisciplinary competencies, and support research into and dissemination of education materials on ethical, legal, and social aspects of al for integration in al education and training programs communicating federal workforce priorities to external stakeholders educating private-sector institutions, higher-education institutions, and the public about the federal government's workforce needs and priorities and how to support fulfilling them is a critical step along the path to intersectoral alignment and optimization: workforce description, recruitment; and development must be fair, transparent, and accountable, and that expectation should be conveyed consistently to all stakeholders in all lines of effort. federal agencies can carry out these communications through posting of success stories in the media, outreach to small and minority-owned businesses, representation in talks and booths at industry trade shows, participation in scientific conferences that span the spectrum of disciplines surrounding al, and program funding announcements other opportunities include education and workforce programs intertwined with research, as in the national al research institutes and extant collaborations among university   faculty and  students, industry  representatives, and the federal government  for



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan strategy : expand public-private partnerships to accelerate advances in ai american leadership in science and engineering research and innovation is rooted in the u.s. government- university-industry randd ecosystem: as the american academy of arts and sciences has written, ""america' $ standing as an innovation leader"" relies on ""establishing a more robust national government-  university-industry research partnership. since the release of the first national al randd strategic plan, multiple administrations have amplified ""the increasing importance of effective partnerships between the federal government and academia, industry, other non-federal entities, and international allies to generate   technological  breakthroughs in al and to rapidly transition those   breakthroughs into  capabilities.' over the last several decades, fundamental research in information technology conducted at universities with federal funding, as well as in industry, has led to new multibillion-dollar sectors of the nation's economy: concurrent advances across government, academia, and industry have been mutually reinforcing and have led to an innovative, vibrant al sector. the growing importance of public-private partnerships was reflected in the addition of strategy  in , and has become more apparent since then, as highlighted here: the three forward-looking themes of this strategy are: achieving more from public-private partnership   synergies;   expanding partnerships to more diverse   stakeholders; and improving, enlarging, and creating mechanisms for randd partnerships achieving more from public-private partnership synergies the private sector often views al as high-potential new tool for business and operational interests, whereas public funding in al research has focused on longer-term impacts and societal good. these complementary perspectives can and should be further integrated into an overall whole: by leveraging resources, including facilities, datasets, and expertise, the strategists and participants in public-private partnerships will more rapidly advance science and engineering innovations. for example, sharing al artifacts, models, data, and results serves to reduce resource use and redundancies. similarly, government-university-industry randd partnerships bring pressing, real-world challenges faced by industry to university researchers, enabling use-inspired research, and leveraging industry expertise to accelerate the translation of open and published research results into viable products and services in the marketplace for economic growth. public-private partnerships are especially well served when they build on joint engagements among federal agencies that enable collaboration and better return on investment in areas where agencies' missions intersect. continued support for cross-government efforts104 such as the national al research institutes15 is key to long-term randd partnership progress. these coordinated investments advance responsible foundational and use-inspired al research in collaborations that benefit from a range of direct and indirect partnerships among governments, academia, industry, non-profits, communities of  practice, and civil society. researchers trained in these environments are well-prepared to expand on such approaches in years to come expansion and extension of multiple types of programs that provide opportunities for researchers from government; academia, and industry to spend time working in another sector would additionally enable federal funding agencies, academia, and the private sector to work more effectively with one another. the unique perspectives and capabilities of each sector enable mutual benefit: industry' s commercialization and scale-up of al systems is assisted by universities' early-stage randd and federal laboratories' focused materials, device, and measurement research, and specialized computing resources 



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan expanding partnerships to more diverse stakeholders expanding partnerships between the public and private sectors to include civil society organizations serves to involve those organizations' unique perspectives in the discussion of future developments regarding the implications of al research, development; and use_ furthermore, development of randd approaches that focus on accountability, equity, and respect for democratic values and human rights is critical in additional considerations of al design, development, and deployment: equitable access to partnerships, ethical guidelines in charters, early experience with developing technologies by wider stakeholder community, and diverse insight into the strengths and weaknesses of participant approaches yield a more robust al infrastructure and ecosystem: also recommended is more concerted effort to produce international collaborations with like-minded governments, multinational corporations, and the civil society organizations of ther nations, which has the potential to accelerate advances in al for global benefit, as detailed in strategy  translation to practice that emphasizes ethics, safety, and public is also of high importance. involvement of civil society and its representative organizations is critical for discussion of equitable access and use, and of trustworthiness issues. companies of all sizes publish guidelines and focus on reducing their risks in al product development. small nonprofit organizations are major contributors to societal for good"" efforts, often with substantial volunteer programs that leverage the growing pool of al talent in the united states. efforts to increase capacity for advisory services across sectors were recommended by the national academies107 to help build partnerships for public good. collaborations between public-private partnerships and civil society organizations are particularly critical in striving for equitable access to and use of al, and in addressing concerns about societal implications to the global ecosphere (e.g , climate change, energy security, agricultural challenges, and healthcare): governments and international bodies play a role in setting standards for just and responsible use. ,  an open-access al collaboration ecosystem that includes large and small corporations, advanced computing capabilities and other resources only available in government agencies, and diversity of organizations having varied perspectives, expertise, and capabilities can lead to a more ethical use of al: these diverse collaborations lead to innovations and support new models such as partnerships between minority-serving institutions and national al research institutes  partnerships can also support the inherently interdisciplinary nature of al randd, which requires convergence between computer and information science, cognitive science and psychology, economics and game theory, the physical sciences, engineering and control theory, medicine, ethics, linguistics, mathematics and statistics, and philosophy. bringing together this wide diversity of disciplines poses and significant research and logistical challenge (for example, in a common taxonomy), but the ultimate outcomes drive the development and evaluation of future al systems that are fair, transparent; accountable, safe, and secure_ improving, enlarging, and creating mechanisms for randd partnerships randd is a team effort, often conducted by diverse groups operating in multiple institutions. public-private partnerships require institutional arrangements to facilitate the pooling of resources for efficient return on investment of time and funding, faster outcomes, and positive impacts, and avoiding duplication of efforts. an array of potential configurations and mechanisms for public-private partnerships has been developed over the past few decades for a variety of al applications. expanding the reach of existing mechanisms, improving their functioning and outputs for more diverse set of participants and application spaces, and creating new forms of public-private partnerships are significant and valuable endeavors. examples include the following:  good ""ai key



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan individual project-based collaborations. in these partnerships, government agencies pool resources and/or expertise with industry, ngos, foundations, and academics to address a critical issue,such as safety and trustworthiness. this is a flexible and rapid approach, but often challenging to sustain and expand: joint   programs to advance open,  precompetitive, fundamental research. government has traditionally played a critical role in supporting foundational research through grants and contracts (primarily at universities), for which there is no short-term commercial application, but instead advances the field as a whole. given the massive needs for expanded fundamental and use-inspired research, innovative methods to private-sector resources to these ends are critical but often challenging, given the short project timescales that profit-driven companies typically operate on. one example that addresses this challenge is the nsf industry-university cooperative research centers  program, which   provides an nsf-supported institutional framework industry to support precompetitive research at universities in general, non-federal partners contributing research resources can receive intellectual property rights as governed by the bayh-dole act  collaborations to deploy and enhance research infrastructure. large-scale al research will require significant research infrastructure, including compute and storage resources joint projects between the government and private-sector partners can achieve economies of scale that enable access to necessary resources for all engaged parties. the nairr11s is one example of a concept that could transform the national al research ecosystem by providing researchers with access to computational, data, and training resources provision of such resources equitably to a large segment of stakeholders is critical to maximizing the impact of such collaborations collaborations to enhance workforce development, including broadening participation. as discussed in strategy , there is a tremendous demand for workers with al skills. every sector is competing for these valued workers while there are many programs to encourage students to enter science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (stem) fields, public-private partnerships should explore opportunities to resources to broaden the overall pipeline of al randd skills. new types of partnerships for curriculum development and new approaches to developing and implementing curricular standards for programs could be especially impactful by building broader capacity for al education and training: federal prize competitions. organizing competitions to address difficult research challengeshas significant advantages for supporting randd. in this form of partnership, the risks are introduced by the participant; not the government: prize competitions represent only a tiny fraction of federal randd spending, but have proved effective at addressing a host of complex scientific and technical challenges one difficulty has been getting from research to usable product: research on how best to maximize impact should be enlarged: for example, competitions that are embedded in a broader structure of public-private partnerships might better enable the transition of the competition winners to deployment.  data and model sharing: creating partnerships with the goal of sharing data and testbeds at scale could make big difference in the breadth of availability of cutting-edge ml models. there are challenges, however, because trained models are potential source of income and competitive advantage for the organizations that train them, and partnerships that require the release of these models to the public or other private organizations would likely cause these organizations to withdraw from such an arrangement: innovation in standards and processes for equitable and responsible data sharing is urgently needed: in each case, leveraging each partner's strengths for the benefit of all is vitally important to achieving the greatest impact.  bring for pool thev



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan strategy : establish a principled and coordinated approach to international collaboration in ai research the  organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) recommendation on artificial intelligence   included investing in al randd as the first   recommendation for national  policies and  international cooperation. while the united states leads the world in annual randd spending, competitors seek to outpace these investments: the national science board's u.s. state of science and engineering (sande)  reportl18 foundthat no single nation leads in all aspects of science and engineering in today' s world: in al, the annual number of publications in the field has doubled between  and , and research production has become increasingly geographically dispersed  ensuring that the united states remains a central hub within the al randd ecosystem requires ongoing participation in international programs, infrastructures, datasets, and secure data-sharing mechanisms; continued access to global talent; sustained productive international cooperation; working with existing international structures that may already regulate the data, infrastructure, and talent that the al randd ecosystem needs; and effective public-private partnerships international partnerships play a key role in facilitating efforts in all these areas: in recognition of the importance of al to economies across the globe, the u.s. government is working to address the pressing need for better access, sharing, management, standards, and common frameworks for data and computational resources, in addition to building out the design, development, verification, validation, and use of trustworthy al. to support this, and future al research, development; and deployment; the al randd community can facilitate opportunities for international research and exchange of ideas and expertise in line with strategy , including the mutual cultivation of al international standards and cross-border frameworks that promote responsible and trustworthy al this strategy is divided into four lines of effort: cultivating a global culture of developing and using trustworthy al; supporting development of global al systems, standards, and frameworks; facilitating international exchange of ideas and expertise; and encouraging a development for global benefit: cultivating a global culture of developing and using trustworthy al groundbreaking scientific research is an inherently collaborative and international activity. given this, global partnerships for the development and deployment of al capabilities are integral to advancing the state of the art in al while ensuring that the full scale of its benefits is realized in a secure, equitable, and ethical way: around the world, ""trustworthy al"" is understood as al with attributes that conform to various ethical, legal, and societal standards. for the united states, these attributes are lawful and respectful of our nation's values; purposeful and performance-driven; accurate, reliable, and effective; safe, secure, and resilient; understandable; responsible and traceable; regularly monitored; transparent; accountable; and advancing equity. federal research and partnership efforts can benefit from international collaboration with likeminded nations to discover and promulgate methods to support al randd and innovation that build public trust and confidence and realize shared values and social priorities such as equity, fairness, accountability, transparency, reliability, security, and safety. these collaborations come in many forms and through many mechanisms; examples include mou1o () with australia'$ commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization, which has initiated a jointly funded research program that includes equitable and trustworthy al; and an administrative arrangement between the united states and european commission to further research on al in application areas including extreme weather and climate 



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan forecasting, emergency response management, health and medicine improvements, electric optimization, and agriculture optimization  u.s. leadership in multilateral fora such as the oecd and the group of seven (g7) has resulted in the  oecd recommendation on al and the launch of the global partnership on al. this work has paved the way for promoting research that aligns with u.s. interests and values, including safe and ethical use of al and building a global community of practice: the united states should continue to engage and lead in these international organizations and fora to signal an interest in randd cooperation and to send a clear message about shared interests in supporting a/ randd, innovation, and cooperation that builds public trust and confidence and respects applicable international law, individual privacy, and human rights additionally, u.s. agencies should evaluate the risks of pursuing al randd collaboration with partners in countries that might not  share democratic values or respect for human rights: when identifying opportunities for dialogue on shared al concerns and priorities, careful consideration should be given to the benefits and risks of discussions with adversaries and competitors. in partnership with countries that share its core values, the united states should develop strategies to combat nefarious uses of al, such as political oppression and coercion, criminal activities, violations of applicable international law, or social manipulation. alignment of activities with the aims stated in strategy  is vital: not only does international engagement foster research collaborations, but it also provides opportunities to directly engage international stakeholders to amplify the impact of randd ties and showcase u.s. leadership. one can look, for example, to recent engagements with the united kingdom and india. u.s. agencies can also consider randd engagement with nations that currently lack robust ai randd ecosystems to build research capacity and strengthen ties: supporting development of global al systems, standards, and frameworks international cooperative research is needed to inform the development of shared and best available metrics, test methodologies, quality and security standards, development practices, and standardized tools for the design, development, and effective use of trustworthy al systems. of particular value are methods for secure data-sharing and methods for applying al to areas of importance such as public health and sustainability. also valuable are systems and environmentsthat provide nations' domestic enterprises with access to the expertise and infrastructure garnered from increased international collaboration and investments. all of this is ultimately a prerequisite for achieving optimum scale and collaboration with international partners, and critical for bringing about an ecosystem around al randd designed from the beginning around principles such as those in the  trustworthy al executive order. also in need of consideration are effective mechanisms for public-private partnerships and international arrangements, as discussed in strategy and. this work is especially complex and intersectional, but small- scale and similarly focused examples could help to guide agencies in pursuit of this research. one such example is the declaration of the united states and the united kingdom on cooperation in al randd12 to advance a shared vision of al and to work toward a mutually supportive al randd ecosystem. another is the recent commitment of the quad (the united states, india, australia, and japan) to establishing various technical standards contact groups, including a group for advanced communications and al focusing on standards-development activities as well as foundational pre-standardization research:  other fruitful avenues include investigating and optimizing the potential of joint  solicitations for al randd with international partners, and of joint international al research and computing infrastructures the it is critical that international cooperative research also focuses on data management, governance, and sharing: one area of consideration is how to share data, especially if it is sensitive  grid along way, key



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan_ data, in a safe and secure way among countries that have different information security standards and capabilities. another is research into allowing interoperability among nations' systems while protecting data and data ownership so that data is treated in a safe and consistent leading to the development of trusted and durable mechanisms for cross-border data transfers for al randd collaboration: a third consideration could be how best to ensure a culture of transparency and disclosure that aligns with the principles of research integrity, both domestically and with allies and partners. overall, it is key that u.s. agencies develop and establish appropriately rigorous standards, policies, and procedures for data sharing, data privacy, and the protection of intellectual property to safeguard data, privacy, and national security: facilitating international exchange of ideas and expertise leading experts and innovators in emerging technologies are spread out over multiple countries and continents ensuring that ideas can flow among them and across locations is necessary for a shared global future of effective and trustworthy al. agency-to-agency collaborations and broader bilateral and multilateral cooperative arrangements provide an opportunity for the united states to address gaps by leveraging al research expertise around the world. such collaboration could be realized through existing programs, such as the embassy science fellows program, u.s. science envoy program, fulbright program, international visitor leadership program, and techcamps, through al-centric tracks. agencies should consider how undergraduate and graduate al randd internships, international fellowships, and exchange initiatives can help build the u.s. stem workforce: these international collaborations can expose researchers to diverse ideas, attract and retain top al randd talent; and foster long-term partnerships among u.s. al researchers. current programs, such as the u.s. intergovernmental personnel act (ipa), illustrate what potential partnerships would look like: ipa facilitates temporary exchanges among federal agencies and other organizations, including state, local, and tribal governments, colleges, and universities. developing similar programs for short-term international exchanges could foster randd activities and outcomes in the international context: additionally, challenges are effective and efficient mechanisms for governments to leverage partnerships, technologies, and other assets for the purposes of cooperative research, development; and acquisition that could be more widely used. grand challenges have provided a leveling platform for multilateral approaches to international collaboration and have enabled highly directed and innovative means of finding solutions to complex societal and industrial challenges of interest to the united states as wellas to global partners, such as those related to health and natural disasters as well as food security: among the strengths of grand challenges is their ability to garner a highly varied set of participants across diversity of sectors, including academic, industrial, and individual technology enthusiasts, and from all manner of origins and backgrounds. this strength is amplified and realized in an international context. the current u.s.-led series of grand challenges on democracy-affirming technologies- are an example, having already demonstrated success via u.s.-united kingdom collaboration on prize challenge for accelerating the development and adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies encouraging al development for global benefit certain uses of al run counter to the values and well-being of the united states, especially when al is utilized for the purposes of political oppression, coercion, criminal activities, violations of international law, and social manipulation: to combat this threat, additional research is needed into the ways in which nefarious usage of al may be countered: this research presents further opportunities to engage with the international community and leverage bilateral and multilateral partnerships with allies and partners to restrict competitors and adversarial nations from gaining access to or acquiring advanced al tools and  way, grand



the national artificial intelligence randd strategic plan_ associated technologies critical to u.s. national security and other interests mutually beneficial alliances and partnerships around al provide the united states with durable means of addressing global al challenges, deterring aggressive behavior, assuring allies and partners, and supporting stability: though not created by al, other existential threats to peace and security could also be countered via al innovations: for example, as described previously, there is opportunity for co-investment with values- aligned countries in novel al techniques to solve long-term global challenges such as those related to health, natural disasters, pollution, food production, and sustainability: in addition, investigation of methods of public outreach and engagement with the broader stakeholder community is important to spread awareness regarding capabilities and limitations of ai_ as global interest in and use of al continues to grow, so does the importance of international cooperation in research and coordination in the field: the united states is already positioned as a leader in al research and innovation. this existing leadership may be leveraged to realize the aims of safe and secure use of trustworthy ai; standardized effective al infrastructure, including robust and equitable data-sharing practices; international cooperation and coordination of al research; and development of al for global benefit:

pursuant to article  of the law on the planning system of the republic of serbia (""official gazette of the rs"" , no. /), the government adopts the strategy for the development of artificial intelligence in the republic of serbia for the period -  introduction the strategy for the development of artificial intelligence in the republic of serbia for the period - (hereinafter: strategy) defines objectives and measures for the development of artificial intelligence whose implementation should result in economic growth, improvement of public services, advancement of scientific staff, and development of skills for the jobs of the future: also, the implementation of the strategy measures should ensure that artificial intelligence in the republic of serbia is developed and implemented in safe manner and in accordance with internationally recognized ethical principles, in order to exploit the potential of this technology to improve the quality of life of each individual and the society as a whole, as well as to achieve sustainable development goals. the strategy is in line with the european artificial intelligence initiative: , which sets out the european commission's artificial intelligence policy: in this context, the republic of serbia, as candidate for eu membership, but also as a participant in the european union framework program for research and innovation, seeks to provide the necessary extent of compliance with the european union, which will enable full integration into the european research area and closer cooperation. . legal basis the legal basis for drafting the strategy are the law on the planning system (""official gazette of the rs"" no. /) and the decision on the formation of the workgroup for the preparation of the artificial intelligence development strategy in the republic of serbia for the period from  to  (""official gazette of the rs"", no. /). . reasons for adopting an artificial intelligence strategy artificial intelligence (hereinafter: al) started to develop several decades ago with highs and lows. the early vears of this decade saw the rapid development and expansion of implementation thanks to the breakthroughs in the field of deep neural networks, the increasing amount of available data suitable for machine learning, as well as the increasing availability of microprocessors suitable for large-scale numerical calculations. many effects of al are already visible, so this technology is expected to shape the development of all segments of the economy and society: al has the characteristics of a general-purpose technology, such as a steam engine, rail or electricity, as its application spreads to all areas of the economy and society and brings about revolutionary changes in many of them. 2in ,the countries adopted the  agenda for sustainable development and  global goals (sustainable development goals) ""artificial intelligence for europe"" com()  final,  [leur-lex europa eullegal-content/en[txt[?uri-com%3a2018%3423723afin 



due to the expected changes brought about by al, many countries have embarked on strategic approach to al development and, so around  countries have developed strategies for al development; with global economic leaders and western european countries leading the way: in the region of southeast europe, no country has published an al strategy in , serbia documented an annual growth of ict services export of over % for the fifth consecutive which also reflects the growth of the ict industry. economic growth, digitalization and education are key priorities of the government of the republic of serbia and al is one of the areas with the greatest potential to contribute to these priorities. by adopting and implementing this strategy, serbia will take the lead in al development in the region. artificial intelligence can improve the efficiency of public administration and the quality of services that the state provides for citizens and the business sector. in addition to the potential benefits in the form of economic development and efficiency improvement, the development of artificial intelligence holds certain challenges these are, first and foremost, the protection of personal data, the risk of inheriting bias and discriminatory factors, the emergence of new professions and the increasing or decreasing need for the existing ones, the education  system's  challenge of preparing students for  jobs of the future, the  provision of transparency, and other ethical issues. consequently, this strategy is being developed as one public policy document containing the definitions of the direction of development and the objectives to be implemented in favor of improvement in this   field, as well as establishing clear, measurable and concrete measures contributing to the development of artificial intelligence for all sectors in serbia. . strategy preparation in accordance with the decision of the government of the republic of serbia on the formation of a workgroup for the preparation of the strategy for the development of artificial intelligence in the republic of serbia for the period from  to  (""official gazette of the rs"" , no /), workgroup for the preparation of the strategy (hereinafter: workgroup) was formed at the initiative of the prime minister's office. the workgroup is composed of representatives of the prime minister's office, ministries   (ministry of education, science and technological development, ministry of economy, ministry of trade, tourism and telecommunications, ministry of finance office of the minister without portfolio in charge of innovation and technological development), institutions (office for information technologies and electronic governance, the science fund of the republic of serbia, science and technology park belgrade), representatives of the university of belgrade (faculty of electrical engineering, faculty of mathematics, faculty of mechanical engineering,   faculty of organizational sciences, teacher education faculty, mihajlo pupin institute), the university of novi sad (faculty of technical sciences), the university of kragujevac (faculty of natural sciences and mathematics) and the university of nis (faculty of electronic engineering), representatives of the business sector engaged in the development and implementation of artificial intelligence as well as representatives of the vojvodina ict   cluster, the petlja foundation, the serbian chamber  of commerce and the world bank. with the support of the world bank, an international expert in this field was hired to hold consultations and a workshop with members of the workgroup with the aim of defining the vision and objectives of the strategy: the document is the result of a comprehensive consultation process with the representatives of all stakeholders: according to the data of the national bank of serbia on the balance of payments of the republic of serbia,  [lwww nbs rslinternet/cirilica/8o/platni_bilans html far , yet: year4,



 the concept; significance and role of artificial intelligence in the framework of this strategy, we use the widely accepted definition of artificial intelligence offered by the european commission's independent expert groups: ""artificial intelligence (al) refers to systems that display reasonable, intelligent behavior by analyzing their environment and taking actions with some degree of autonomy to achieve specific goals. al-based systems can be purely software-based, acting in the virtual world (eg. voice assistants, image analysis software, search engines, speech and face recognition systems) or al can be embedded in hardware devices (e.g. advanced robots, autonomous cars, drones or internet of things applications) ' thereby, we have in mind that there is no universally accepted definition of artificial intelligence: although al is not a new term, the acceleration of its development in the 21st century caused scientists and experts to constantly revise its definition: in the history of al, there have been highs and stagnations, starting with logic-based approaches (1950s and 1960s), knowledge-based expert system approaches (during the 1970s and 1980s), and data-based approaches (from  onwards) with periods of frustration and reduced investment6. we are now at the beginning of new phase of high expectations encouraged by huge amounts of data and increased computing   capabilities. this combination has enabled the development of machine learning (ml) in the framework of al, as an opportunity to predict future behaviors based on large datasets on past behaviors. machine learning represents a paradigmatic shift and potential: traditionally, a programmer would write a computer code by setting the rules required for processing the entered data to get a response as output. in ml, the system automatically forms an algorithm based on examples of input data and expected responses. therefore, it is said that computer system based on ml ""learns"" or ""trains"" , instead of merely executing the algorithm given by the programmer the current progress of al, and especially of ml, is the result of several factors. firstly, increasingly realistic computer games require   specialized graphic   microprocessors  suitable for extensive parallelized numerical calculations. when the manufacturer of graphics adapters nvidia opened the possibility to use microprocessors in graphics adapters for general purposes (through programming interface called cudat in , expensive supercomputers were no longer required for the extensive numerical calculations required by ml. secondly, vast amounts of data became available when the networks between computers and their users were established. the digitization of images, videos, voice, and text has created data-rich environment: this has allowed artificial intelligence researchers to revise old neural network models and train them with very large datasets in order to solve some complex issues such as image recognition and machine translation. while it was previously believed that, for example, computers must understand the language and its structure before translating text and speech from one language to another, it is now possible to apply ml to millions of translated sentences with the computer learning to translate autonomously without being taught the rules of both languages. this has significantly accelerated the process, leading to the availability of real-time translation applications for mobile phones thirdly, the development of ml algorithms based on neural networks has progressed and specialized software libraries are now available, implementing those algorithms via microprocessors from graphics adapters. sa definition of al: main capabilities and scientific disciplines, independent high-level expert group on artificial intelligence set up by the european commission, . craglia m.

in ,these trends led to a major breakthrough in new machine learning methods, known as deep learning: at that time, some well-known issues, such as speech recognition and object identification in images, were more effectively solved by deep learning methods. although ml methods are generic, meaning that they can be applied in different fields and to different types of data, the learning outcome depends heavily on the quality of the training dataset, which often needs to be semantically annotated, further structured and refined: on the basis of filed patents,the world intellectual property organization prepares an analysis of technological trends in a/. the trends are analyzed by techniques, functional applications, fields of application, key participants, and geographical locations. analysis shows that the most widely used techniques in patent applications in the field of al are machine learning, and within that deep learning: among the functional applications of al, computer vision is the most prevalent, which includes image recognition, natural language processing, speech processing, robotics, and control methods. the main fields of al application are transport, energy, telecommunications, medicine, agriculture, and public services: as far as key participants are concerned, most of the al patents come from the industry (consumer electronics, telecommunications, software, electricity, and car manufacturing), and fewer from university or research organizations. geographically, most al patents originate in japan, the united states, and china. the abovementioned data undoubtedly indicates that al is one of the drivers of the fourth industrial revolution, primarily because of its multidisciplinarity, i.e. connecting al with other areas in the development of innovative solutions: studies also indicate that artificial intelligence could double annual global economic growth rates over the next  years. %t is expected that al will influence growth in three ways: by improving labor productivity up to % due to innovative technologies that enable the same number of workers to deal with a bigger workload, by creating ""smart machines"" in the form of systems and programs that can learn and solve problems almost independently, and finally, by expanding innovation and innovative solutions in combination with other economy sectors which will contribute to their growth  and development: the mckinsey global institute predicts that about % of companies will implement at least one type of technology based on al by , while just under a half will possess the full range of such technology. research estimates that the global gdp will be increase by about .% annually: in recent years, a large number of state institutions around the world11 have introduced the so-called chatbots or virtual assistants that answer citizens' questions automatically. based on the questions and answers, the system learns how to improve the responsiveness over time, thereby relieving officials and making time for less routine questions and tasks requiring expertise: in , the australian tax authority developed an advanced virtual assistant, ""alex"" who can provide answers to specific tax questions, such as how to correct a tax error, how to look into the existing debt situation, etc. transportfor london has created its own chatbot on facebook, via which real-time information about the current status or delays of subways, buses and planned works can be obtained: despite the considerable benefits al development holds for the society, there are also potential and accompanying challenges that need to be considered and incorporated into the plans for further development: these are, first and foremost, the protection of personal data, the need to adapt the education system and qualifications to take full advantage of the development and deployment of artificial intelligence including non-technical areas (for example: medicine, agriculture and forestry, law), ethical challenges like the prevention of discrimination on any grounds, as swipo (). wipo technology trends : artificial intelligence. geneva: world intellectual property organization 9artificial intelligence is the future of growth, accenture,  1mckinsey global institute,  #architecture for public service chatbots, digit, directorate-general for informatics, isa2 programme ec.' europa.eu/isa2 key filing



prejudices and biases can be inherited through training data, the challenge of transparency, as the rules based on which the system makes decisions are often not transparent in the impact on the job market and the need for continuous monitoring of the types of professions with growing and declining demand: without attempting to narrow down the concept of artificial intelligence, it should be emphasized once again that the reason for the adoption of this strategy is the rapid development and expansion of artificial intelligence implementation, which began during the first years of this decade thanks to the breakthroughs in the field of deep neural networks and the consequent technological advances facilitated by this breakthrough:  connection with existing policies and legal framework according to the provisions of article  of the law on the planning system, this strategy represents cross-sectoral and national strategv, and it was prepared in accordance with the provisions of article  ofthe lawon the planning system and is in line with other strategies, programs and plans, as well as with the applicable legislative framework. other policy documents related to this strategy are 1_ the strategy for the development of education in serbia by  (""official gazette of the rs""_ no. /) the development of artificial intelligence is closely associated to the development  of education: one aspect of association is the education of experts who need to be involved in the development of artificial intelligence and its implementation. another equally important aspect is the education system's response to the changed environment of the learners' life and work due to artificial intelligence.  scientific and technological development strategy of the republic of serbia for the period - research for innovation (""official gazette of the rs""_ no. /) the strategy for scientific and technological development of the republic of serbia for the period - recognizes the need for closer cooperation between science and industry, as well as the need for support of both fundamental and innovation research: further attention was drawn to strengthening the capacity of highly educated staff and young researchers: this strategy builds on the stated priorities of scientific and technological development with an emphasis on the development of artificial intelligence: 3_ proposal of the egovernment development program in the republic of serbia for the period from  to  and action plan for its implementation the development of artificial intelligence implementation in public administration is directly linked to the development of egovernment: 4_ strategy for the development of an information society in the republic of serbia by  (""official gazette of the rs"" , no. /) besides the priority areas, the strategy for the development of an information society in the republic of serbia by  stipulates the provision of broadband  internet access for educational and scientific institutions, followed by the support of ict research and innovation and the development of e-services, which represents all areas closely related to the development of artificial intelligence: 5_ strategy for the development of information security for the period - (""official gazette for the rs"" no. /) ml,-

. the law on electronic government (""official gazette of the rs"", no. /) this law regulates the performance of public administration tasks using information and communication technologies. accordingly, the application of artificial intelligence in public administration belongs to the realm of egovernment: . the law on electronic communications (""official gazette of the rs"" _ no_ /, / (constitutional court), /,/ (other law)) in many applications of artificial intelligence, there is need for the use of electronic communications for high-volume data transmission, with high network reliability or minimum delays. this especially applies to public mobile networks. . the law on information security (""official gazette of the rs"" , no. /,/, /) as pointed out in the explanation of the associations with the strategy for the development of information security in the republic  of serbia  for the period -, artificial intelligence is associated with information  security in many ways. on the one hand, information and communication systems based on artificial intelligence about specific security challenges, on the other hand, artificial intelligence is often used in measures for information security: description of the current situation a comparative analysis of initiatives and policies, as well as concrete solutions based on artificial intelligence that are developed and used in various countries in the european and wider international context, but also the consultations with members of the workgroup being eminent industry and academic experts have revealed that the determination of the current state and the potential for further development and deployment of artificial intelligence in the republic of serbia requires the consideration of the current situation in sectors that can be influenced by the development of artificial intelligence in the most beneficial ways_ in this context, the need for reviewing the situation in the private sector, the education system and scientific research activities, the public sector, as well as the review of the potential impact and benefits for individuals and society as a whole, has been identified. in addition to the situation in sectors, the situation needs to be considered with respect to the required preconditions, which condition the development and application of this technology: these are, first of all, the existence of adequate infrastructure and the availability of data as a resource, but also the existence of an adequate legal framework that will enable the research, development and use of socially useful solutions based on artificial intelligence, while preventing the abuse of this technology and ensuring the adherence to ethical principles and security of the individual: . situation in serbia as measured by the artificial intelligence readiness index of the existing international indicators of the artificial intelligence status, the artificial intelligence readiness index (hereinafter: index) is the only one providing comparable indicators for large number of countries in the world (). this index is still in development and so far only two reports have been published, and it has been used as an indicator of serbia'$ position in the comparative perspective: 12this index was prepared by oxford insights in collaboration with the international development research centre (idrc):  bring key key key



based on the  report, serbia is ranked out of  countries. the index measures eleven indicators grouped into four areas: governance, infrastructure and data, skills and education, and public administration and services. this index is composite, which means that the data for forming the overall score is obtained from other existing indices from previous years (some of the data dates back to ) and is based on the research of publicly available data. although the focus of the index is on the provision of public services, the indicators also show the degree of readiness of the private sector and the society as a whole for technological solutions based on artificial intelligence. according to the index, slovenia is ranked highest (38th place) in comparison to other countries in the region, while bulgaria, hungary and romania are ahead of serbia. north macedonia and croatia rank   slightly lower  than serbia, while montenegro, albania and bosnia and herzegovina are significantly less prepared for the development of artificial intelligence than serbia: regional artificial intelligence readiness review according to index country rank score slovenia  . bulgaria  . hungary  . romania  . serbia  . north macedonia  . croatia  . montenegro  . albania  . bosnia and herzegovina  . . current situation of sectors in serbia .. education and science education is factor for the development of al in serbia. considered from historical point of view, serbia offers high-quality education in the fields of technical and natural sciences, which is relevant for ai: according to the global competitiveness indexl5, serbia ranks 55th in the pillar measuring skills (with a score of .). the most relevant indicators in this area that also represent the prerequisites the development of artificial intelligence are: workforce skills measures how much companies invest in their employees' training: in terms of company investments in the employees' acquisition of skills, serbia is ranked 104th out of  countries (with a score of .) based on the data, which leads to the conclusion that the private sector solely relies on formal education (at school or faculty) or independent action results for all indicators are presented in the appendix the results need to be interpreted indicatively. 14government artificial intelligence readiness index , oxford insights and the international development research centre i5global competitiveness report : how to end a lost decade of productivity growth, world economic forum  58th key key for 13the



for the acquisition of skills. this indicates that more investment in employees is needed, especially in the form of informal training or education: graduate skills measures to what extent the skills acquired until graduation from college and high school match the skills required working in the business environment in this area serbia occupies the position at a global level (with a score of .), which is not a bad result and speaks in favor of the previous information that the economy relies on formal education. general population skills denote the ability of citizens to read digital content or to use computer at an elementary level. in this segment, serbia ranks (with a score of .). in this segment; there is considerable room for improvement and education of the population, since the mere use of artificial intelligence implies that citizens know how to recognize when they are interacting with it (for example, when they are assisted by a virtual assistant, and not human): during the past few years, serbia has become one of the leaders in europe when it comes to education of students in the field of information technology, thanks to reforms of the education system: informatics is compulsory subject in elementary schools from the fifth grade, teaching students block programming (most often the scratch programming language), while from the sixth grade, they learn textual programming (most often using the python programming language): in the eighth grade, they already encounter elements of data science. the number of specialized information technology departments has increased significantly to more than  in secondary schools, so that almost % of first-year high school students are educated at specialized it departments. despite significant advances in the study of information technology at primary and secondary schools in the framework of general and vocational subjects, topics dealing with artificial intelligence are not yet represented to a significant extent: curricula in primary and secondary schools provide for cross-curricular correlations, but there is still a low level of multidisciplinarity in the taught approaches to problem solving: higher education at most faculties for technology and mathematical and natural sciences includes subjects concerning different fields of al, but they are still insufficiently represented. in recent years, there has been a significant increase in students' interest in it courses at colleges due to increased interest, but also an increased demand of the private sector, faculty capacities have increased as well: the construction of new facilities of technical faculties throughout serbia is underway or planned: in addition to investments in spatial infrastructure, the development of new courses at faculties has been invested in: topics addressing artificial intelligence are represented in the study programs in different ways and to a different extent, but the learning content dealing with artificial intelligence in the study programs of computer science, computer engineering etc. is not standardized, while the required learning content dealing with, for example, operating systems, compilers, rational databases etc is highly standardized: as good example of cooperation with the private and non-governmental sector, the government of the republic of serbia has launched the master . program in the framework of postgraduate studies, which includes subjects in the field of al. leading faculties for technology and mathematical and natural sciences in serbia participate in the implementation of the master program in addition to the modern program dealing with artificial intelligence and data science, students will also have lectures related to product and company development in the field of it. also, international experts from foreign universities will participate in the implementation of the master program:  for 65th 77th



despite the existence of such examples, the level of cooperation of the faculties with the business sector, as well as with each other in the planning and implementation of study programs is not sufficient: postgraduate studies provide the opportunity for a greater degree of specialization and there is room for artificial intelligence-oriented educational profiles, which is currently underutilized: as for informal education, it is not possible to establish a definitive list of such opportunities, but some of the opportunities were: retraining for work in the field of information technology. so far, the government of the republic of serbia has conducted retraining for beginners in the it sector completed by about , people: similar programs are being implemented worldwide: they represent a good example of how the business sector can quickly find the desired staff. currently, there are international internet courses and retraining programs for al targeting employees in the it sector. up to now, retraining programs have not covered narrow professional trainings such as artificial intelligence, and short study programs have not yet provided sufficient professional training opportunities in the framework of artificial intelligence. however, despite the quality staff serbia has to offer (as evidenced by the remarkable successes of individual local companies and the continuous growth of ict service exports), there are related challenges, such as: insufficient staff insufficient investment in startup companies small number of researchers in the field of al at universities and institutes insufficient cooperation between universities and the business sector. also, there is a modest connection between  technical  faculties with al development companies, and an almost minimal connection of other faculties (e.g. in the field of agriculture, medicine, etc:) with al development companies. investment in research and development is crucial for the development of al in serbia. investing in the development of science in research institutions will result in greater scientific contribution in the field of al, but it will also contribute to the development of education in the field of ai: according to the global competitiveness index, serbia occupies the 55th position (with a score of .) in the area of randd measured in the framework of the of innovation potential. in this area, a relevant indicator is related to the number of publications and the number of citations of scientific research: in this respect, serbia occupies the 61st position, which indicates that there is room for improvement: by developing research in the field of artificial intelligence, serbia can contribute to the development of science by adding an original contribution to this issue. it is important for investments in science to be competitive: the science fund was established this year with the aim ofmaking science funding in serbia more competitive. one of the first programs of the science fund will be a program to support the development of artificial intelligence research. these initial steps in the direction of an increased incorporation of artificial intelligence in research studies are important, but the research in the field of artificial intelligence is still underdeveloped: this refers to both research studies focusing on artificial intelligence as main research area and research studies focusing on other areas deploying artificial intelligence. also, the innovative application of modern artificial intelligence methods based on or related to the use of deep neural networks and associated scientific and technological developments is underrepresented in the research:  key pillar



cooperation between scientific research institutions, the industry and the public sector in the implementation of artificial intelligence is not yet sufficiently developed, but it is necessary, given the level of investment in the development of artificial intelligence occurring globally in the industry and the ability of the public sector to be a source of data and domains of implementation: research in the field of artificial intelligence in each of the scientific research institutions is usually focused on the particular aspects of artificial intelligence concerning these institutions, and no scientific research institution deals with artificial intelligence with a holistic approach. through the improvement of education, modernization of legislation and investment in the innovation fund and the science fund, initial steps have been taken to address these issues. further investments in the solution of these problems via the strategy is indispensable, with an emphasis on al. .. economy according to the data of the national bank of serbia (hereinafter: nbs) on the balance of payments of the republic of serbial, the export of ict services (item ""telecommunication, computer and information services"" in the balance of services) has recorded a continuous growth, which is more than % annually during the last four years. if we add that in the first eight months of this year, the growth of ict service exports was higher by .% than in the same period last year, we can say that  will be the fifth year in a row with a growth of ict service exports of over % per year. according to the general evaluation in the vojvodina ict cluster report on the status of the ict industry in serbia17 which divides the ict industry in the telecommunication sector and the information technology sector (hereinafter: it sector), the it sector in serbia is export-oriented: according to this report, the export of it services and software has been the main activity of  companies in , employing over , people, which makes % of the total it workforce in serbia. this data leads to the conclusion that almost half of the it workforce in serbia works in companies exporting it software and services: in , the average income per employee was € ,, while the value added per employee amounted to € ,. on the other hand, we can have a look at the startup ecosystem data. according to the report by startup genomel8, whose latest report included the analysis of the status of the startup ecosystem in belgrade and novi sad (analyzed as one ecosystem), the serbian startup ecosystem is in the initial development phase with an estimated value of $  mil: (s  mil. being the global average value): as an advantage of the domestic ecosystem, the report recognizes the low vat rate and the quality and accessibility of domestic developers blockchain and gaming are emphasized as most developed fields. of the indicators widely related to the economic area, we would highlight the following indicators from the global competitiveness index: attitude toward entrepreneurial risk measures the willingness to take risks and start one's own business_ in serbia there are strong tendencies to avoid risks in this segment, based on which serbia ranks among  countries (score .). what is needed is the improvement and support for the development of entrepreneurial spirit: innovation capability measures how fast innovative companies can progress and grow. in this segment; serbia holds the 83r position (with a score of .), but the available data does not indicate the concrete barriers hindering development   ilwwwnbs rslinternet/cirilica//platni_bilans html 17ct in serbia at a glance, vojvodina ict cluster,  18startup genome, global startup ecosystem report,   107th



cluster   development, i.e_ the presence of strong clusters   including the  geographical concentration of companies and suppliers, manufacturers of related products and services and institutions specialized in specific field: concerning this area, serbia holds the 104th position, which indicates that there is considerable room for improvement; mainly concerning connection, which can be realized through cooperation in the framework of projects dealing with artificial intelligence. cooperation between various stakeholders measures a) the cooperation of employees within companies, b) the cooperation and sharing of ideas between companies for the purpose of innovation and c) the level of cooperation between the business sector and universities. serbia is not ideally ranked in this field (it holds the position and has a score of . out of ) and the data supports the findings stated during consultations that respective improvement is necessary, especially improvement of the cooperation between the business sector and faculties and between companies dealing with the development of innovations based on artificial intelligence concerning the part of the it sector or the startup ecosystem dealing with artificial intelligence, there are no studies delivering precise data on the number of companies and their economic indicators based on consultations with the private sector dealing with the development and application of products using artificial intelligence, we concluded that this sector mainly consists of small and medium enterprises primarily focusing on a narrow range of products and on the implementation of the existing technologies in the realm of ai. on the other hand, al is present in projects of bigger it companies as well, but such projects represent only a small share of their business the presence of it companies representing global leaders is still modest when it comes to development resources located in serbia: however, the role of such companies can be meaningful for gaining experience and improving the skill level of local experts. representatives of the it industry have a divided opinion on whether serbia's priority should be attracting ""big fishes"" or focusing on developing the local startup ecosystem: although many startup companies use artificial intelligence in the development of their products and services, there is still no clear focus on the aspects of artificial intelligence in the activities aiming at the development of the startup ecosystem: representatives of the it industry deem the current connection between local companies using artificial intelligence insufficient: the impression of business representatives is that one of the reasons is that local companies dealing with al are oriented towards foreign markets. concerning the connection of the industry with other sectors, it is recognized that the connection with universities is at a modest level as well, even if best practice examples do exist. this refers to faculties of technology and mathematical and natural sciences, where the need for a tighter connection and cooperation is more obvious. however, italso refers to other faculties, especially in the fields of medicine, agriculture and forestry: cooperation might enable multidisciplinary approach to the creation of innovative solutions concerning the policy generally related to small and medium enterprises (hereinafter: smes), the preparation phase ofa new strategic document for smes is ongoing, which will be valid after , and which will recognize the significance of digital transformation, including the use of artificial intelligence as one of the elements having a great influence on and developmental potential for smes. in addition, the implementation of the program supporting the digital transformation of the sme sector in  is underway, with the ofestablishing an infrastructure for the support of smes and creating possibilities for development and application of al for the optimization of business processes and the enhancement of the business of individual smes.  87th goal



the chamber of commerce and industry of serbia has founded the center for digital transformation (cdt) ~ a national hub for innovative practices mostly oriented towards micro, small, and medium enterprises. the cdt supports the digital transformation of serbian businesses through education, consulting, as well as the establishment of strategic partnerships with technology owners, on the one hand, and companies willing to integrate the respective solutions in their business, on the other. the activities performed in serbia for the purpose of attracting investments have no clear focus on artificial intelligence and do not include measures directly connected to artificial intelligence, be it the attraction of companies developing capacities in serbia, the attraction of venture capital for investments in serbian companies or support for innovation projects the practice of supporting the development of innovative products and services through a public procurement planning policy is generally not sufficiently represented, which naturally applies to innovative products and services in the field of artificial intelligence as well. considering the fact that there is an increasing amount of products and services using artificial intelligence on the market, it becomes more difficult to recognize the difference between those products and services significantly contributing to progress in the development and implementation of artificial intelligence and others just being somewhat related to artificial intelligence and therefore especially promoted: if the policies and measures aiming at economic development on a wider scale and at the information technology industry on a narrower scale are supposed to have an according focus in the field of development and implementation of artificial intelligence, clearly defined areas of special interest for the development and implementation of artificial intelligence are missing: .. public sector the strategy preparation process included the performance of a wide consulting process and an analysis enabling the identification of work areas ofthe public sector, as well as services where the implementation of solutions based on al would be most effective: the consulting process has shown that the public administration does not exploit the potential of artificial intelligence enough. in the course of consultations, three areas have been identified, in which artificial intelligence can contribute significantly to public welfare and the provision of better and higher-quality services: public administration- the enforcement ofthe reformsofthe public administration has been accompanied by progress in the establishment of a user-oriented electronic administration via the provision of an adequate legal framework, the indispensable infrastructure and interoperability, optimization and digitalization of administrative procedures and services although the application of artificial intelligence in the public administration and in the public sector as whole has not been reported so the vision of a modernization of services based on principles contained in the tallinn ministerial declaration on egovernment and the accompanying annexl9 is mentioned in the text of the proposal for the electronic administration development program for the period of  to , which is currently in the adoption process. it explicitly expresses the readiness for the implementation of innovative technologies like artificial intelligence in the process of further development of electronic services. advanced solutions for business analyses and prediction (so-called business intelligence) can provide a more comprehensive and objective view of the situation and contribute to a more rational use of resources, a higher-quality and efficient administration and strategic decisions based on more information. the implementation of a conversational user interface and virtual assistant (so-called tallinn declaration on egovernment from october ,  and the ""user-centricity principles for design and delivery of digital public services annex from the meeting of ministers during the estonian presidency of the european council  key far, 19the

the field of artificial intelligence and, above all, through the establishment of exceptions on a limited market for the purpose of innovation testing: the business representatives also recognize the need for greater flexibility in the development of regulatory solutions in order to enable development and testing of innovative solutions. flexibility is reflected in the establishment of the so-called sandbox the sandbox is special regulatory framework enabling companies to test innovative solutions or business models in accordance with an approved plan and under supervision of a responsible authority with a limited number of users. these mechanisms are mostly dedicated to the financial sector in the european union (banking, fintech, insurance): there is one such example in serbia, which has been developed by the national bank of serbia and which is also used in the financial sector. the law on payment services created an appropriate legal basis (in the framework of the limited network exclusion) for companies for the purpose of testing innovative payment services they are planning to introduce. interested companies (e:g. startup companies) and entrepreneurs can test certain innovative payment models under controlled conditions, without the obligation of prior obtainment of a license for the provision of payment services: sandbox enables the testing of the business model in the initial phase without carrying out the whole expensive process of btaining a license, especially when the convertibility and profitability of the model cannot be completely assessed so far. in this case, it is mandatory to first consult with the national bank of serbia and provide insight in the testing, which is compliant with the practice in the european union. from the perspective of the business sector, this model should be implemented in other areas a5 well; especially in areas where artificial intelligence, especially the one based on machine learning can contribute to the development of innovations (e.g. testing of autonomous vehicles): startup companies and smes hold the leading positions concerning innovations on many markets. the access to the public procurement market creates excellent opportunities for their growth. the public procurement of innovative solutions implies the public sector's use of its purchasing power in order to act like an early adopter of innovative solutions that are still not available at a commercial level. on the other hand, the public procurement of innovative solutions enables the public sector to modernize public services and achieve savings at the same time recently, the european commission has published the ""public procurement as a driver of innovation in smes and public services"" guide22 showing policy makers at a national and regional level what they can do in order to support innovation procurement: with the new procurement directives, the european union has established an even stronger legal framework for innovative procurements. in addition, eu programs, and especially the european structural and investment funds, as well as the horizont  program offer interesting options for financing the public procurement of innovative solutions the elected board for artificial intelligence of the house of lords states in the report ""al in the uk: ready, willing and able?"": ""to ensure greater uptake of al in the public sector, and to lever the government's position as a customer in the uk, we recommend that public procurement regulations are reviewed and amended to ensure that uk-based companies offering al solutions are invited to tender and given the greatest opportunity to participate "" report on regulatory sandboxes and innovation hubs, esma,  21national bank of serbia,  lop europa eulen/publication-detaill-[publication/f5fd4d90-azac-11e5-b528 01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-pdfisource-  parliament uklpa/ld201719/ldselect/idai//1oopdf  2ojoint  l



the world economic forum centre for the fourth industrial revolution developed the ""guidelines for al procurement"". the tax treatment of innovations is also important for the development of artificial intelligence: amendments to the corporate profit tax law in  caused positive developments in this area, as they enabled the recognition of expenses for research and development in the double amount, in case the research was conducted in serbia: the same regulation reduced the profit tax rate from the company's income based on intellectual property created in serbia from % to %. according to the startup genome's report, such tax treatment of innovative solutions is recognized as one of the key advantages of the serbian startup ecosystem25 and, based on the existing conditions, it can be concluded that the tax treatment of innovation is at a satisfactory level: thus, there is no need for interventions, but the maintenance of the named treatment must be guaranteed for the following period: the following issues are recognized as future challenges concerning the regulation: the need for the establishment of several frameworks of a limited regulated market (sandbox) for the purpose of encouraging innovation. the need for adaptation of regulations concerning public procurement by the state, using innovative solutions based on artificial intelligence in order to facilitate efficiency. an insufficient regulation of the legal framework concerning data ownership regulation of algorithmic bias (for more information see: individual and society): .. open data data is an indispensable resource for the development ofmodern intelligent solutions and the availability of big and diverse datasets owned by public administration and business authorities is one of the prerequisites for the development of an industry producing solutions based on al and creating new value based on the data, as well as for the development of education and scientific research activities. the availability of data is one of the conditions for the development and ""training' of progressive artificial intelligence systems whose deployment can enable an easier and faster achievement of sustainable development goals. the private sector in serbia in the field of artificial intelligence is mostly made up of small and medium enterprises that do not have the capacity to independently collect data at this stage of development: this represents great challenge for students, faculties and startups, which is why mechanisms need to be found that can ensure a reuse of as much datasets as possible, the ones owned by the public as well as the private sector. ... data of the public sector in serbia, the initiative for opening data of institutions has been introduced in , when the government of the republic of serbia in cooperation with the united nations development program and the world bank assessed the preparedness and began to conduct the project ""open data open opportunities"" based on the formulated recommendations2s. at the beginning of ,the open data workgroup was formed, consisting of the representatives of institutions, civil society and expert organizations, academic institutions, business associations and international development partners with the objective to plan and coordinate activities concerning the opening of data, providing support to institutions and contributing to the education on the importance and benefits of opening data, but   weforum org/docs/wef_guidelines_for al procurement pdf 2sstartup genome, global startup ecosystem report,   the project ""open data open opportunities"" is conducted by the office for information technologies and egovernment of the government of serbia in partnership with the united nations development program and supported by the world bank, the uk fund administration and the swedish international development cooperation agency:  key key key



also to provide for continuous communication and cooperation between the public administration and the civil sector, and to encourage the demand for open data: the office for information technologies and egovernment (hereinafter: ite office), which institutionally manages the process of opening data in serbia, established the national open data portal in  27as a key element of the infrastructure indispensable for publishing, easily browsing and downloading data sets, but also as central spot connecting publishing institutions with the society of users who can contribute to the improvement of data quality and suggest the opening ofnew data sets by their feedback during , comprehensive legal framework for the opening of data has been established, performing an initial adjustment to the directive on the reuse of public sector information28 article  of the law on electronic government29 from  introduced the obligation of authorities to publish data from their area of responsibility together with metadata, in a machine-readable open format and in a manner enabling easy browsing and reuse, while the regulation on the mode of operation of the open data portal3o regulates the manner of administration of the portal, the obligations of the authorities in the portal, the usage of datasets and technical standards. in november ,  datasets were available in the open data portal, i.e.  individual resources (files) at the moment of drawing up the strategy,  organizations published their data, while  users registered accounts. numerous trainings, lectures, activities for professional and technical support for institutions, events promoting the concept of opening and reusing data, public tenders for project proposals and ""challenges"" in form of public tenders that resulted in the creation of innovative web applications, portals and platforms based on open data and other activities have also been realized. in spite of this, during the establishment of a new strategic framework in the field of electronic government; the e-government development program for the period of  to , it has been found that the number of publishing institutions and the amount of published datasets is still not satisfactory and a range of additional measures for overcoming this situation has been formulated: the development of the methodology and standards the opening of data with the definition of datasets that are prioritized for opening is in process, as well as the preparation activities for the creation of the annual program for the opening of data. in this context, the private sector, academic institutions and researchers working in the field of al must be included more in order to ensure that the annual program of opening data includes datasets of particular importance for the development of artificial intelligence. during the consultations  referring to the creation of the strategic  framework for al development; the data concerning business performance of companies, taxing and data from the field of traffic and healthcare have been identified as priority for opening: in order to ensure an appropriate volume of available data, it is necessary to overcome challenges relating to an insufficient data production, therefore further consultation should identify areas where appropriate records, registers and mechanisms for data collection should be established. 27the national open data portal is available at:  gov.rs 28directive //eu of the european parliament and ofthe council of  june  amending directive //ec on the re-use of public sector information (psi directive) 29law on electronic government; ""official gazette of the republic of serbia"" no. / 3regulation on the mode of operation of the open data portal, ""official gazette of the republic of serbia"" no_ / 31numerous activities are offered on open data day and during open data week; in ,an open call for proposals was launched in the field of open data, and during  and ,open data ""challenges"" have been realized twice  for



... data of the private sector the provision of private sector data for reuse can be considered from the perspective of the public sector (data provision ""business to government"" b2g) as well as from the perspective of the private sector (data provision 'business to business""_ bzb), while the comparative practice is aware of several models through which the availability and reuse of private sector data can be ensured: some models of the b2g data provision in comparative practice32 can be: data donations as an expression of company' s corporative responsibility, rewarding through ""challenges"" partnerships, mediation, or civic data provision. one segment in which the obligation to provide information to the public sector can be secured is in cases when private companies are entrusted with activities of public significance like utility services, public transport and similar. in order to achieve this, public procurements and contracts must contain the mandatory criterium of the private service provider's obligation to assign the data to state authorities without reimbursement and to define the structure, form and format of data as well as the deadlines for the submission of updated data. when it comes to data from the private sector for which no obligation of opening for reuse can be identified, consultations and comparative practice analysis have shown a need for considering the introduction of stimulating measures or tax benefits for companies providing their data. the need for the establishment of platform for publishing and exchanging private sector data has been articulated, with clearly defined solutions for its maintenance, annotation and data storage. the need for a comprehensive catalogue of all available datasets in the public and private sector has been identified: concerning b2b data provision, other approaches are possible as well from an open data model; the free provision of data for an unlimited number of users and the possibility of its monetization and market establishment; to the establishment of closed platforms offering additional services on top of the data, but also enabling better control over data use .. infrastructure the development and testing of artificial intelligence-based solutions require the provision of an appropriate infrastructure of high-performance computers and the need for a platform via which high-performance computer resources would be available for research organizations, faculties, but also small and medium enterprises and startups that are not able to provide the required resources themselves, was clearly articulated during the consulting process in , the ite office founded the state center for data management and storage (hereinafter: data center) in belgrade, which provides state administration authorities and government offices with the required infrastructure resources via state cloud. atthe moment, actions are taken for the establishment of a state data center in kragujevac, which should, besides providing additional security for and encouragement of a further development of the electronic government system, contribute to the development of the whole ict sector, given that one part will be intended for commercial use: immediately after the opening of the data center kragujevac, the ite office plans on establishing national platform for artificial intelligence combining the most modern high- performance computer systems with a software platform and on providing the academic community, science and technology parks, the   public administration and businesses with access to this infrastructure for the development of innovative solutions: 32communication from the commission to the european parliament, the council, the european economic and social committee and the committee of the regions ""towards a common european data space"" com// final, commission staff working document; guidance on sharing private sector data in the european data economy  i.e_



furthermore, according to the data of the republic agency for electronic communications and postal services (ratel) published in the market overview for , all three mobile network operators have a high 4g mobile network coverage, covering between % and % of the population and between % and % of the territory of the republic of serbia. the accelerated development of 4g networks followed the sales of a spectrum of radio frequencies in the range of  mhz, which took place in . the first 5g base station was experimentally launched on june ,  in the science technology park belgrade: . the individual and the society the development of artificial intelligence brings about many advantages, but also challenges for individuals as well as the society as a whole: although many of the challenges are still not visible, comparative practice has shown challenges like representativeness of data used for machine learning, redefinition or elimination of the need for certain professions due to the introduction of artificial intelligence, the need for additional qualification of the population for future jobs and issues concerning the responsibility for consequences of autonomous system decisions based on artificial intelligence like, for example, in the case of car accidents including autonomous vehicles. in order to guarantee availability, safety and an even and just use of al, and simultaneously build trust in al on the part of society, it is important that technological progress in the field of al is accompanied by careful consideration and awareness and that challenges caused by the development of al are presented: policies and the legal framework of the republic of serbia in this field follow the eu standards the general regulation of the european parliament and the eu council on the protection of persons  concerning   personal data processing (hereinafter: eu general data protection   regulation) guarantees high standards of personal data protection and requires the implementation of measures assuming the certain protection of personal data anda design of products and services in favor of data protection: the republic of serbia introduced the data protection law in  and the currently applicable law from  is compliant with the general data protection regulation (eu): the european commission issued the press release ""building trust in human-centric al"" in   where the key requirements ""ethics guidelines for trustworthy artificial intelligence"" are supported3, which have been established by a high-level expert group formed by the commission these key requirements are: human agency and oversight technical robustness and safety privacy and data governance transparency diversity, non-discrimination and fairness societal and environmental well-being accountability 33market overview of telecommunications and postal services in the republic of serbia in ,  /lwwwratel rs]uploads/documentslempire_plugin/pregled%2otrzista% pdf 34general data protection regulation (eu) /,  /leur-lex europa euleli/reg///0i 35building trust in human-centric artificial intelligence; com()  final,  /leur-lex europaeullegal contentenltxtruri-com:. fin 36ethics guidelines for trustworthy al,  leceuropa eu/digital-single-marketlen/newskethics-guidelines- trustworthy-ai 



challenges that can be expected for society and individuals and that require preventive actions for a responsible al development are the following: although this type of problem has not yet been identified within serbia, it is necessary to prevent discrimination based on machine learning: comparative practice has shown cases of unintended discrimination which can have considerable consequences for citizens. this is especially valid for artificial intelligence developed for the improvement of public services for example, system may be introduced that determines the level of risk of individuals committing breach r crime. if the used data is not adequately reviewed, such system might reproduce a discriminative pattern: there are no clear mechanisms to determine whether particular artificial intelligence solution has met all the necessary requirements to be applied to a large number of users and whether it has been developed in such a way that the data used for training the model or its application is adequate, representative enough and protecting the personal data of citizens: the sudden increase of artificial intelligence implementation requires responsible and inclusive development of artificial intelligence the whole society and consequently the compliance with international guidelines, practice and regulations is indispensable and the implementation of these principles in practice must be guaranteed  what we want to achieve artificial intelligence is a factor that will globally cause significant changes in everyday life, work and business during the upcoming years. serbia will be among the countries using the challenge of artificial intelligence as an opportunity for progress consequently, we want to achieve that in serbia:  the education system, among others, develops the competencies for future needs of the job market, referring to professions directly connected with artificial intelligence and all other professions changing under the influence of artificial intelligence, which become more or less necessary or which didn't even exist earlier;  the business sector successfully adapts to new working models and new market expectations accompanied by a strong development of business entities whose business is based on the use of artificial intelligence; 3_ the development of scientific research activities significantly contributes to the emergence of highly competent experts in the field of artificial intelligence and its implementations, while research results contribute to the development of the business sector; . the legal regulation is in all fields adapted to the new circumstances brought about by artificial intelligence, the requirements of new business models and product developments and services based on artificial intelligence, while taking into account the protection against potential negative effects. 5_ there is comprehensive understanding of ethical aspects while planning, designing and implementing solutions in the field of artificial intelligence from perspective of technical characteristics as well as from a perspective of effects of implementation, while taking into account the principles of preserving the freedom of individuals, fairness and equality, avoidance of damage, openness, transparency and sustainability.  for



 strategy objectives the general objective of the strategy is the use of artificial intelligence in favor of economic growth, employment and improvement of the quality of life. special objectives of the strategy are:  development of education geared to the needs of modern society and economy conditioned by the advancement of artificial intelligence. 2_ development of science and innovation in the field of artificial   intelligence and its implementation 3_ development of the economy based on artificial intelligence (where this is a competence and where it is used in difference industrial branches) 4_ improvement of assumptions for the development of artificial intelligence and public sector services through the implementation of artificial intelligence 5_ ethical and safe application of artificial intelligence . specific objective : development of education geared to the needs of modern society and economy conditioned by the advancement of artificial intelligence. education (formal and informal) is the basic means of human resources development in a certain field: besides the field of artificial intelligence and its implementation, education needs to respond to broader changes in society and business as consequence of the global progress of artificial intelligence. even if it is not possible to anticipate the future development of the job market at the level of individual jobs, there are trends that can serve as indicators: increasing multidisciplinarity in relation to classical divisions of professions and areas of competence, and in particular the linking of knowledge and skills in the socio-humanistic and artistic fields with the knowledge and skills in the fields of natural sciences and mathematics as well as technical and technological sciences; increasingly important and growing role of data which is to be perceived from the perspective of data-based inference and decision-making, personal data protection, data ownership, data openness, data sharing, value exploitation from data, cooperation based on data use and data as the fuel of artificial intelligence; methods and means used in the modern professional practice are indicators for the direction of the development happening under the influence of artificial intelligence and other technologies, based on which, even if the effect on future professions cannot be precisely predicted, the gap between the material learned at school and the methods and means of modern practice in the respective field can be reduced;  key



.. measure .: enhancement of teaching contents at primary and high schools in accordance with the requirements conditioned by the progress of artificial intelligence in primary school, the broader context of work automation and data analysis needs to be observed, with an understanding of the difference between machine learning and algorithms completely designed by humans. at high school, besides the aforementioned, the results and contents   improving the qualification of pupils for the use of artificial intelligence in their future work or for the further acquaintance with artificial intelligence in future education need to be predicted in the framework of teaching topics focusing on information technologies, depending on the educational background. in the framework of standards of cross-curricular competencies for the final phase of high school education37, digital competence is emphasized as special cross-curricular competence: still, the role of artificial intelligence in cross-curricular competences needs to be determined: special attention should be to multidisciplinarity in all areas, as the trends of new professions, directly or indirectly influenced by the development of artificial intelligence, generally move towards multidisciplinarity, compared to the professions inherited from the industrial age. as the implementation of changes in the education system is complex and time-consuming, this measure should be implemented in two phases: in the short term, the activities that will kickstart and shape the process should be envisioned; in the long term, this will lead to actual changes in the programs of teaching and learning, and educational standards with an appropriate development of competency among the teachers and other factors that influence the capacity building within the educational system: the development of teachers' competencies is the central link and main challenge for the implementation of this measure: all subjects need to be adjusted to the multidisciplinary approach, and this adjustment presupposes not only getting to know the concept of multidisciplinarity, but also obtaining an elementary level of specific competencies in related fields, as well as competencies in modern methods in the original field that include multidisciplinarity: apart from multidisciplinarity which is relevant for teachers of all subjects, the development of teachers' competencies in technology-oriented subjects will present a special challenge. ... institutions responsible for monitoring and control of implementation . ministry of education, science and technological development . the institute for the improvement of education  the institute for the valuation of education quality ... indicators 1_ the number of primary school subjects where the teaching and learning program properly includes artificial intelligence compared to the target values defined in the first phase: initial value:  target value for the end of :  target value for the end of :  2_ the number of subjects in high schools where the teaching and learning program properly includes artificial intelligence:  standards in education, institute for the valuation of education quality, /ceo edu:rs/craunapau-v-obpazobatby/  paid

budget of the republic, and partially by foreign companies. the program also included internships in companies, while lecturers from abroad participated in the implementation of the program. this type of competition could be implemented for all programs in the field of al: apart from the master studies program oriented towards expert education for the needs of the industry, attractive phd programs should also be developed in an attempt to keep successful students at universities in order to produce the next generation of great scientists. these programs will help the students gain the latest knowledge in the field of al, which will allow them to have excellent jobs in serbia, as well as develop their own ideas in companies and scientific research institutions in serbia. ... institutions responsible for monitoring and control of implementation: . ministry of education, science and technological development 2_ higher education institutions ... indicators 1_ the number of al ma programs: the initial and target values of the indicators will be determined in the framework of the implementation of the measure_  the number of students in al ma programs: the initial and target values of the indicators will be determined in the framework of the implementation of the measure_ 3_ the number of al phd programs: the initial and target values of the indicators will be determined in the framework of the implementation of the measure_ .. measure .: development of professional training through short study programs and informal learning constant professional training is extremely important for all jobs in the it sector, and in especially dynamic fields, such as al,it is even more important: it is important to provide the possibility for existing experts in the field of it and other experts with enough necessary prior knowledge to gain competencies for the application of modern machine learning methods it is necessary to plan and implement activities that will contribute to an increasing number of experts with   appropriate   prior knowledge of it, mathematics and statistics   gaining such competencies through programs of informal learning and short study programs these can be programs that last from several months to ayear, and which would train participants to work in teams that implement al projects. short study programs, recently implemented in the higher education system, are realized with the purpose of professional training and, together with training programs that belong to informal learning; they represent forms of professional development by way of which this measure is realized. apart from programs that last for several months, the measure must include support for shorter forms of informal learning, such as seminars and thematic courses, especially if they contain the factor of al popularization. this includes supporting the organization of expert conferences in the field of artificial   intelligence  application, with   particular   emphasis on conferences with an international character. one of the forms of non-formal education are events that have a competitive character, where the problems are solved by artificial intelligence. it is necessary to support the  using



organization of such competitions, as well as the participation of individuals and teams from serbia in international competitions. there is particular need to plan and implement activities that will contribute to educating the wider population about al, including supporting educational programs aimed at the general population and developing freely available educational materials this measure may include activities that financially or otherwise support the implementation of training, development ofnew training programs and short study programs, attendance of training or short study programs, organization of conferences, etc it is recommended that higher education institutions analyze the possibilities for implementing short study programs in the filed of al, in accordance with market needs. ... institutions responsible for monitoring and control of implementation . ministry of labor, employment; veterans' and social affairs . ministry of education, science and technological development 3_ higher education institutions ... indicators 1_ the number of participants who finished trainings supported by this measure in the current initial value:  target value for the end of :  target value for the end of :  2_ the number of short study programs in the field of al: the initial and target values of the indicators will be determined in the framework of the implementation of the measure .. measure .: greater openness of universities for cooperation with the aim of implementing study programs in the field of artificial intelligence very dynamic development of artificial intelligence is accompanied by very large investments of companies in development projects, alongside attracting top experts who work in these companies and become more mature: on the other hand, companies cannot and do not attempt to take the role of universities in educating new professionals this is why there is clear interest for both sides for the cooperation between the business sector and the universities in planning and implementing study programs: however, successful models of cooperation are not easy to establish: one of the main issues is the manner in which experts from the business sector can participate without having academic rank for teaching purposes apart from cooperation with the business sector, due to the multidisciplinary character of artificial intelligence use, it is necessary to expand the cooperation among the universities in planing and implementing study programs, as well as to allow students to their multidisciplinary competencies with an increased mobility between universities. this measure should start from focusing on study programs of postgraduate studies, however, over time, the focus should expand to include undergraduate studies as well: activities included in this measure should help identify and remove any barriers to achieving better cooperation between the universities and the business sector, as well as among universities in implementing study programs in the field of artificial intelligence and the establishment of such cooperation should be supported and encouraged.  year: gain

in the process of analyzing  large amounts of data generated by the digitization of   public administration, with the aim of improving the efficiency, cost-effectiveness and transparency of public administration work. for example, risk analysis for inspections through upgrading of the elnspector system: the implementation of solutions based on machine learning, deep learning and processing large amounts of data has huge potential for improving the services that public administration provides to citizens, the economy and the state, but also for performance optimization and the improvement of services of all other systems within the public sector. in the healthcare system, artificial intelligence can significantly improve early diagnostics, ensure better availability of all resources and equipment and optimize their use, as well as contribute to the improvement of the quality and efficiency of health services. the use of artificial intelligence in the field of transport can significantly improve traffic and mobility in urban areas and optimize traffic signaling through real-time traffic management. ... institution responsible for monitoring and control of implementation office for information technologies and egovernment ... indicators 1_ number of implemented projects for the improvement of public sector services using artificial intelligence verification source: annual report of the artificial intelligence council initial value:  target value for the end of :  target value for the end of :  2_ the ""importance of innovations and technology for the future"" indicator from the wef networked readiness index assesses the level of innovations and aspirations to use new technologies as an integrative element of public policies in the future and it is measured on the basis of the management' $ plans to use information   technology to increase competitiveness. initial value: ./. target value for the end of : ./. target value for the end of : ./. . specific objective : ethical and safe application of artificial intelligence the application of artificial intelligence opens up a number of ethical and safety challenges that need to be addressed and prevented. many other countries are faced with the same challenges, so international standards should also be taken into account: ethics and safety in the development of artificial intelligence should be ensured primarily with regard to the protection of personal data, the protection against discrimination when using machine learning, and the establishment of responsible artificial intelligence development in accordance with international ethical principles. the goal is to introduce  prevention mechanisms that will allow the responsible development of artificial intelligence and methods of verifying that systems based on machine learning are in compliance with the highest ethical and safety standards. .. measure .: personal data protection in the field of artificial intelligence artificial intelligence raises specific questions about the protection of personal data, both for data used for machine learning and for data processed using artificial intelligence. it is necessary to ensure that personal data is protected during the development phase of solutions based on artificial  flow for



intelligence (data used for ""training"") and data that is post-processed through an already trained system that uses new data. within this measure, the key focus will be on developing an activity plan and implementing a practical diagram of the steps that must be taken to protect personal data in the development of solutions based on artificial intelligence that will be used equally across all sectors of society (the private sector, state administration and universities): in addition, certification of products and solutions based on artificial intelligence will be established to ensure the protection of personal data and  compliance with international ethical standards. it is necessary to define and develop certification program for solutions a) established by public authorities and b) the private sector, which will provide safety and ensure public confidence that the developed solutions are in accordance with the regulations for the protection of personal data. ... institutions responsible for monitoring and control of implementation: . ministry of justice . confidant for personal data protection 3_ office for information technologies and egovernment ... indicators 1_ the number of companies implementing the scheme for step-by-step artificial intelligence development in order to ensure personal data protection. initial value:  target value for the end of :  target value for the end of :  2_ the number of certified  solutions based on machine learning, whose compliance with regulations on personal data protection and internationally accepted ethical standards is confirmed: initial value:  target value for the end of :  target value for the end of :  .. measure .: protection   from discrimination in the implementation of artificial intelligence the automation of decision-making using artificial intelligence, or of the analyses that influence decision-making, involves the risk of including criteria which are discriminatory by nature: the data used for training algorithms can be based on past discrimination (e.g. women have been higher risk taxpayers in the past and the algorithm forecasts the same situation in the future), there can be unbalanced data (e.g. significantly more data for men than for women causing the algorithm to favor men afterwards) , or the responsible person fails at including all relevant data sources in the training: in addition, individuals who are subject to the decisions made by the al model must have the right to an explanation and the right to transparency in connection with the algorithm. that is why it is necessary to enable: prevention of discrimination, enable early understanding and interpretation of the model and enable explanation of the decision: the ethical implementation of artificial intelligence should prevent the social exclusion of vulnerable social groups, the marginalization and discrimination of members of these groups like old persons, disabled persons, groups with the risk of multiple discrimination and others. even if discrimination is not a new category, it can become systemic if it is established via machine learning, which is a risk that needs to be prevented: 



in order to achieve this, technical and non-technical methods for ensuring the protection from discrimination need to be established in the implementation of artificial intelligence, namely: . establishment of a set of practical ethical guidelines compliant with the ethical code which must be observed by all persons training algorithms and which include the recommendation that the team working on the development of artificial intelligence should be as diverse and representative as possible in order to prevent discrimination; 2_ organization of educational workshops with technical and non-technical personnel working on the development of artificial intelligence as primary target group in order to prevent discrimination; 3_ organization of competitions in the framework of which control and tool systems will be developed that can be used by the industry as preventive mechanisms in order to prevent the use of bias and discriminatory data characteristics for algorithm trainings; 4_ regulation of the discrimination prohibition in cases where discrimination occurs as a result of automated decision-making or assistance in decision-making, and clear definition of responsibilities in cases where machine learning leads to discrimination; 5_ establishment of the regulatory obligation that the data types used by machine learning for decision-making or assistance in decision-making are transparent and based on clear and simple schedules: ... institutions responsible for monitoring and control of implementation:  artificial intelligence council  confidant for equality protection 3_ ombudsman . office for information technologies and egovernment 5_ office for human and minority rights ... indicators . amendments to the law governing the prohibition of discrimination so that discrimination resulting from the use of artificial intelligence/ml is recognized initial value: no () target value for the end of : no () target value for the end of : yes () 2_ the number of executed training sessions for the prevention of discrimination in machine learning for technical and non-technical persons initial value:  target value for the end of :  target value for the end of :  .. measure .: provision of  responsible development of artificial   intelligence in compliance with international ethical standards considering the fact that artificial intelligence is a highly progressive technology with a reach and effect on society that is not fully known so far and cannot completely be foreseen, it is important to actively work on creating an environment that will, on the one hand, ensure the trust ofthe public, and on the other hand enable the creation of new opportunities for ai development and implementation: the key objective is to find a balance between the support of al development ad implementation and responsible al development based on basic ethical principles in this sense, the development of an ethical framework should enable the protection of basic human rights and common values, but it should also serve the further development of al through the creation of new 



opportunities for the improvement of individual lives and the progress of the whole society: to achieve this, it is necessary to: . issue national ethical guidelines based on the ethics guidelines for trustworthy artificial intelligence created by the expert group appointed by the european commission in april, . the document would first define an ethical framework, i.e_ values for a further development and implementation of al, and subsequently it would establish clear guidelines for all stakeholders: entities developing al systems, system users, the whole society: the basic principles of said document will include the implementation of the al system in support of the development of a democratic and just society, for the purpose of protecting basic human rights and enable human supervision. one of the key components for the establishment of a reliable al system is technical robustness requiring a system development with a preventive approach to risks. this includes the predictability of the behavior of systems based on al, the reduction of unintended and unexpected damages, and the prevention of unacceptable damages like the protection from abuse of private data of individuals, from discrimination of individuals and groups, and s0 on. 2_ it is necessary to ensure the principle of transparency for the elements relevant for al systems data, systems and applied business models sustainability and ecological responsibility of al systems must be encouraged as well as research on the implementation of al solutions dealing with fields of global significance like the sustainable development goals. it is necessary to establish mechanisms ensuring the responsibility of al systems, before and after their development, launch and implementation: 3_ based on ethical guidelines and international practice, an analysis of the compliance with the existing legal regulations needs to be conducted and the needs for amendments to the existing regulation or the issuance of a new one must be pointed out in order to address challenges, but also to encourage socially responsible al development: it is crucial to conduct this analysis via an inclusive dialogue, as it must equally represent the interests of all stakeholders and be compliant with the best examples of international practice. 4_ encourage public dialogue in the form of organizing workshops, seminars, lectures and the like directed at the broad public in order to present benefits, but also highlighting the challenges emerging from the development and implementation of ai. it is crucial to build trust in al implementation through dialogue and to encourage the social responsibility of the public and  private sector for transforming challenges brought about by al into new opportunities for the development of individuals and the society as a whole: ... institutions responsible for monitoring and control of implementation  artificial intelligence council 2_ artificial intelligence institute 3_ ministry of education, science and technological development ... indicators  adopted ethical guidelines for the development and use of artificial intelligence initial value: no () target value for the end of : yes () target value for the end of : yes () 2_ conducted analysis of the compliance of existing legislation with international practice and recommendations for further compliance and adoption of new legislation based on ethical guidelines initial value: no ()  key

vision and goals  denmark is to be a front-runner in responsible development and use of artificial intelligence: over the years; the use of new technology has led to many advances, and globally, technological development has forged significantly better conditions for many people_ denmark has been quick to grasp the opportunities brought by new technology to generate economic growth and welfare for everyone there have been rapid developments within artificial intelligence in recent years. the major breakthrough with artificial intelligence is that it enables computers to learn without human intervention: artificial intelligence uses data and algorithms mathematical formulae to mimic the way humans learn, make decisions and solve problems: the technology is already available in danes' lives, for example when they are navigating in traffic, listening to music on their mobiles or searching the internet: today, artificial intelligence is primarily used for simple tasks in a single limited area, e.g: image recognition. on the other hand, the task is usually carried out at a speed and precision that far exceeds human ability. in the slightly longer term, artificial intelligence is likely to be able to learn to perform more tasks within different areas. for example, this could be a housekeeping robot that can learn to vacuum and clean up without necessarily having to be programmed to perform the individual tasks_ there is currently intense work being undertaken aimed at achieving this broader form of artificial intelligence, as there are great potentials in the technology: in order to influence this development; it is vital that we strengthen the development of artificial intelligence in denmark national strategy for artificial intelligence march  living



what is artificial intelligence? artificial intelligence is systems based on algorithms (mathematical formulae) that; by analysing and identifying patterns in data, can identify the most appropriate solution. the vast majority of these systems perform specific tasks in limited areas, e.g: control, prediction and guidance. the technology can be designed to adapt its behaviour by observing how the environment is influenced by previous actions. artificial intelligence is used in a number of areas, e.g. search engines, voice and image recognition, or to support drones and self-driving cars_ artificial intelligence can be a crucial element to increase productivity growth and to raise the standard of in the years to come_ source: the oecd the european commission;  in the long term, artificial intelligence that resembles human intelligence could be developed. today, there are still large differences between the human ability to learn new things and reflect, and computer's ability to do the same with artificial intelligence. it is impossible to say for certain when or whether at all we will reach point where computer technology can reason at a human level: this government strategy takes its outset in the current level of development of artificial intelligence_ the strategy paves the way for how we can the most out of the potentials in this technology within a foreseeable number of years. as the technology develops, there will be a need for new approaches and initiatives that we cannot necessarily predict today_ it is important that denmark exploit the opportunities in artificial intelligence, so that we support the competitiveness of danish businesses, so that denmark can remain one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and so that the public sector can provide world-class services_ for example, the technology can help the individual citizen to translate and read texts in different languages, navigate in traffic, and reduce and tailor energy consumption at home according to individual needs_ with regard to businesses, artificial intelligence could help create new and more efficient business models, e-g: by planning transport routes, thereby reducing time spent on logistics, and by identifying errors in reports to banks, insurance companies and pension companies. in the public sector, artificial intelligence can support improved services, e.g: quicker diagnoses of illnesses; it can develop better and more accurate traffic control systems, and it can provide citizens with smarter and simpler communication with the public sector: national strategy for artificial intelligence march  living and get



artificial intelligence will change the way in we work it will place new demands, but it will also provide opportunities to learn new things and perform tasks more efficiently. denmark has have a flexible labour market and a well-educated and agile workforce with a positive attitude towards new technology. this is good basis for getting everyone on board. the danish population has a high degree of trust in each other, and we are generally positive towards digital and technological development: however, the rapid development may make some feel insecure about the future. therefore the government considers it crucial that danes continue to feel secure and to be confident that developments in society and in the use of artificial intelligence will centre on our shared values of freedom; liberty, security and equality. the government's vision denmark is to be a front-runner in responsible development and use of artificial intelligence: when artificial intelligence supports people, e.g. in making a decision, it is vital that we ensure that our values are in focus at all times_ we have to place the same requirements on algorithms as we do on an employee  the algorithms must ensure equal treatment by being objective, fair and impartial of personal conditions. this means that artificial intelligence must not reflect prejudices or biases against gender, disability or ethnic origin. furthermore, it is important to ensure that the data used by artificial intelligence is correct: artificial intelligence should help us to analyse, understand and make better decisions. however; the technology cannot; and should not; replace people or make decisions for us_ for example, a physician should still make the final diagnosis for a patient: trust grows between people, and new technologies must not be allowed to change this. artificial intelligence must be used responsibly_ therefore, the government will promote the use of artificial intelligence as a supplement to human decision-making, in order to exploit the benefits without compromising our social values_ denmark is one of the world's most digitised countries. denmark will use this stronghold to attract knowledge and technologies as well as influence the development of responsible artificial intelligence in close cooperation with the other nordic and european countries. if denmark and europe fail to act quickly and with care, we will lose both our competitive edge and influence on developing artificial intelligence_ national strategy for artificial intelligence march 



in december , the european commission presented an action plan for artificial intelligence the government will work to generate support from the other eu member states to exploit the potentials in the technology responsibly to benefit european citizens and businesses_ europe and denmark should not copy the us or china both countries are investing heavily in artificial intelligence, but with little regard for responsibility , ethical principles and privacy_ denmark will focus on responsibility and ensure good framework to exploit the growth potential in artificial intelligence in the sectors in which denmark already has international strongholds so that denmark can remain at the forefront: objectives for artificial intelligence the government sets four objectives in this national strategy for artificial intelligence for how denmark can be a front-runner in responsible development and use of artificial intelligence_ . denmark should have a common ethical and human centered basis for artificial intelligence artificial intelligence must be developed and used within the relevant legislation, and with respect for the rights of citizens. this means that businesses and the public authorities must have strong focus on data ethics which, among other things, include responsibility , security and transparency in the use of artificial intelligence_ the goals of the government are that: ethical principles are incorporated in the development and use of artificial intelligence to secure respect for individuals and their rights, and for democracy_ denmark attracts knowledge and projects by being among the best in the eu at exploiting opportunities to develop and use responsible artificial intelligence_ internationally, denmark works actively to ensure that responsibility is a guiding principle in the use and development of artificial intelligence national strategy for artificial intelligence march 



. danish researchers should research and develop artificial intelligence in order to support the development of artificial intelligence, denmark must strengthen research efforts further. researchers in denmark will research artificial intelligence through basic research and more application-oriented research to pave the way for development of useful technological solutions for the individual, businesses and the public sector: enhanced research efforts will also help ensure that denmark can influence the development of artificial intelligence in the long term so that it is shaped according to danish values. the goals of the government are to: prioritise research into digital technologies such as artificial intelligence further in the years to come_ establish better access to high-quality data for researchers in artificial intelligence_ support a good framework for attracting, developing and retaining research talents within artificial intelligence in denmark: . danish businesses should achieve growth through developing and using artificial intelligence realising the potentials in artificial intelligence also requires that danish businesses invest in the technology and have access to the right resources and competences_ there is also an ambition for danish businesses to exploit the focus of the strategy on responsible use of artificial intelligence in their business models, so that this can be a competitive advantage both nationally and internationally_ the goals of the government are that: denmark is among the best in the world at exploiting data and new business models based on responsible development and use of artificial intelligence_ businesses increase their investment in responsible artificial intelligence danish businesses have better access to employees with digital skills, to data and to the latest research within artificial intelligence_ national strategy for artificial intelligence march 



. the public sector should use artificial intelligence to offer world-class services artificial intelligence will be used to improve public services with outset in the needs of citizens. the public sector will also use artificial intelligence to support faster and more efficient case processing: the goals of the government are that: the public sector will be among the leading countries in europe in using data and artificial intelligence to improve and target public services_ the public sector works systematically on a framework and methods to support responsible use of artificial intelligence so that investments and solutions are utilised as well as possible_ the authorities have a good framework to utilise data to develop artificial intelligence.  national strategy for artificial intelligence march

good starting point  but challenges as well denmark has a starting point but other countries are moving rapidly up the digital agenda. if denmark is to remain among the most digitised countries in the world, there are a number of challenges to address. artificial intelligence is already used in many of the products and services that are part of everyday life in denmark_ in apps, search engines, image recognition, diagnosis and facial recognition, as well as for automation in industry: several public institutions in national, regional and local government also use artificial intelligence, e.g: for application forms, customer service calls, invoicing, etc_ the first experiences from artificial intelligence for faster and better treatment are also now being seen in the healthcare sector. in the private sector, there is also work on artificial intelligence in industry and transport as well as in the financial and insurance sectors. several start-up businesses are using artificial intelligence, e.g. to automate customer services, so that customers' problems can be identified more quickly: this means that customers can immediately get into contact with the relevant service staff, and this prevents telephone queues and waiting times. there are considerable potentials to generate further growth and better public services through greater use of artificial intelligence. an analysis by mckinsey estimates a significant growth potential in using artificial intelligence as we already know it today. it is hardly possible to realise the full potential, but the analysis indicates that there is great potential for more growth and prosperity in the danish economy national strategy for artificial intelligence march   good being e.g: using



denmark has a good starting there is a good outset for exploiting artificial intelligence. we are already well underway, and denmark is the most digitised country in europe. denmark has number of elements already in place for work with artificial intelligence_ danish businesses, particularly the largest businesses, already use digital technologies extensively, and historically danish businesses have been extremely at implementing new technologies. this means that denmark has many global digital business successes the danish public sector is one of the world's most digitised. denmark has a well-developed digital infrastructure, e-g: mobile-phone network and broadband; digital post (digital mailbox for messages and communications from public authorities) and nemid (eld solution) , as well as high-quality public-sector data and population with good it skills. denmark has also been good at digitising the public sector without compromising the confidence and trust that characterise danish society_ denmark has high priority on research: denmark is among the countries in the oecd with the highest public investment in research and development; measured in relation to gdp , and there are strong research environments within artificial intelligence_ the total public research budget for  is dkk  billion (eur . billion): danish research enjoys international recognition, and it is high on international rankings of e.g. scientific impact:  national strategy for artificial intelligence march  point good



examples of artificial intelligence early diagnosis of cancer at odense university hospital saves lives the region of southern denmark is working on using artificial intelligence to diagnose cancer more quickly. by analysing pictures of cancer cells, artificial intelligence can see whether a cell is cancerous with high degree of certainty. early diagnosis makes it possible to commence treatment faster , and thereby improve patients' chances of survival. the work is part of a larger initiative in the area at odense university hospital: optimisation of the drinking water system in the of aarhus production, treatment and distribution of drinking water demands a lot of energy, which is expensive and bad for the environment: using artificial intelligence, the chain project being funded by innovation fund denmark will analyse large volumes of water-consumption data (from sensors etc ) to minimise energy consumption on pumping water. this could also reduce the environmental impact of operating the water system: baggage at copenhagen airport in , . million passengers went through copenhagen airport: this was an increase from . million in . more passengers means more baggage. therefore, since , copenhagen airport has been using artificial intelligence to optimise baggage handling: among other things, artificial intelligence is used to predict where staff can probably best empty aircraft and cases on conveyor belts. focus is on time optimisation. this has resulted in fewer queues and better passenger experience _ artificial intelligence will help beer tasting at carlsberg , different beers are screened every day at the carlsberg laboratory in valby near copenhagen. it is a difficult and time-demanding process_ therefore, researchers at the laboratory have launched a project to measure taste aromas before the beer is brewed. the laboratory will use chemical sensors to test thousands of different types of yeast_ data from the yeast types will be analysed using artificial intelligence, and then researchers will be able to predict whether a yeast has the right quality. in the future, it is likely that the technology could also be used to measure other food, air pollution, etc_ national strategy for artificial intelligence march   city  put



research and innovation are the foundation for future solutions to the challenges facing society. and they are the key to grasping the huge opportunities in artificial intelligence. denmark has a flexible labour market; making it possible to adjust rapidly to changes in technology and to ensure that employees can change quickly between positions. danish experience shows that new technology does not lead to lower employment levels, but it shifts employment between sectors and job functions_ finally, in an international context; the danish population is well-educated, almost all danes use the internet on a daily basis, and there is high degree of mutual trust and confidence. this means that denmark is adaptable, and there is a good basis for implementing artificial intelligence ail in all there is a good foundation for developing and using artificial intelligence_ but there are challenges as well a good outset is not enough: to realise the full potential in denmark, it is necessary to take action in a number of areas challenges for the use of artificial intelligence in denmark need for common guidelines and an ethical framework for artificial intelligence: artificial intelligence entails a new way of making decisions: it raises a number of ethical issues relating to the relationship between advantages from new technologies on the one hand, and consideration of people's basic rights, due process_ and danish social values on the other hand_ need for more data in danish for artificial intelligence: there is a demand for more data to train algorithms, and danish is a small linguistic area. this constitutes a barrier to developing solutions that use language understanding or voice recognition in danish, for example_ lack of employees with the right skills: % of businesses report that face challenges recruiting it specialists. at european level, there is an estimated demand of , specialists within it programming; and this is expected to increase in the years to come_ low level of investment: denmark ranks lower than comparable countries with regard to private investment in artificial intelligence_  national strategy for artificial intelligence march  using they -



need for a common ethical framework for artificial intelligence artificial intelligence entails an entirely new way of making decisions, in which computers and algorithms play a larger role_ for example, the introduction of self-learning algorithms on social media creates uncertainty regarding the extent to which we can rely on recommendations from intelligent systems_ this raises number of questions regarding responsibility and security that need to be addressed. furthermore , artificial intelligence raises a number of ethical issues relating to the relationship between, on the one hand the advantages from using new technologies, and, on other hand, consideration of people's basic rights, due process, and fundamental social values_ demand for more data in danish for artificial intelligence a prerequisite for using artificial intelligence is access to high-quality data. incomplete datasets are a challenge for public and private organisations and researchers who want to work with artificial intelligence_ denmark is also a small linguistic area, and this makes it less attractive to develop artificial intelligence that operates in danish and understands danish text and speech. developments are often in english, and special efforts are required to ensure that digital solutions are developed in danish  this is a problem for businesses, public authorities and researchers_ a solution to this challenge will improve the possibilities for all parties to develop new solutions in danish and for the danish market. lack of employees with the right skills and more high-quality research artificial intelligence entails an increasing need for people with technical and digital skills. many enterprises are challenges with regard to recruiting and retaining employees_ particularly it specialists_ as many as % of danish businesses were unable to find it specialists in  (statistics denmark; ). new research is helping develop new solutions and products, and therefore, high-quality research is crucial if denmark is to be among the leading countries in the area_ even though denmark has strong research position in general, and strong research environments in artificial intelligence, there is a need to further intensify research in artificial intelligence few investments in denmark the us and china are clear front-runners in investment in artificial intelligence. more than % of global investment and patents over the past decade have come from companies in the us and china: in the us, this trend is driven by the technology giants and many start-ups, while in china developments are to a great extent promoted by the central government_ the position of the us and china is in part due to the size of their populations. however, even after taking into account the size of the population, denmark is still below comparable countries such as israel, finland and sweden regarding private investment and number of patents applied for in artificial intelligence (mckinsey ). national strategy for artificial intelligence march   facing



the us and china; but also finland and israel have developed ambitious plans for using artificial intelligence, and these will increase total investment in the technology: in denmark; only few businesses and public authorities have strategic priorities for artificial intelligence (mckinsey ). cohesive initiatives with this strategy, the danish government is paving the way for denmark to take the lead in responsible development and use of artificial intelligence. the government will implement targeted efforts within four focus areas: four focus areas a responsible foundation for artificial intelligence  more and better data 3_ strong competences and new knowledge 4_ increased investment in order to ensure that specific experience from relevant areas of society is gathered immediately, the government will set goals for work on artificial intelligence within specific priority areas. these areas are: priority areas healthcare energy and utilities agriculture transport objectives will take their outset in the areas own ambitions and contribute to ongoing follow- up and work on artificial intelligence_ the focus areas as well as the priority areas are based on the government's other work on future-proofing denmark: for example, the government has started several initiatives to help establish a better framework for development and use of artificial intelligence in denmark:  national strategy for artificial intelligence march 



disruptionradet (a partnership for denmark's future) has discussed the impacts on the labour market and the changes artificial intelligence will entail for many jobs, and it has spotlighted data ethics as a competition parameter. moreover , several initiatives have been launched to strengthen education and training, and to attract talent: the strategy for denmark's digital growth and the digital hub denmark initiative have focus on the opportunities for businesses in big data and artificial intelligence. furthermore, the framework for using artificial intelligence was further strengthened with initiatives for a digital infrastructure, including modernised telecommunications agreement and 5g action plan. with the world-class digital services in the cohesion in the public sector reform, the government has paved the way for how the public sector is to provide better and more cohesive digital services for citizens, including through increased use and dissemination of new technology. the reform will ensure that people have access to services based on their needs by accelerating e-government efforts and contributing to better and more cohesive welfare_ the research and innovation policy strategy denmark ready for the future and implementation of the research reserve for  will strengthen research in digital technologies_ there are also efforts to enhance digital competences, including the stem action plan (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) , teknologipagten, and trials in primary and lower secondary schools to promote understanding of technology. the initiatives mean that denmark has a good foundation to exploit artificial intelligence , with good research, good framework conditions and a digital public sector. the aim of the strategy is also to support danish cooperation on artificial intelligence with other countries, in particular in the eu, the oecd, the council of europe and the nordic council of ministers. if denmark is are to succeed in promoting responsible development and use of artificial intelligence, not only in denmark; but also internationally, coordinated efforts at european level are vital: international cooperation on artificial intelligence the eu action plan for artificial intelligence made in europe the european commission has established a common european framework for collaboration on artificial intelligence. in the upcoming budget period, the eu will invest in european development of artificial intelligence through horizon europe and the digital europe programme_ this provides opportunities for danish businesses, authorities and research communities_ nordic-baltic cooperation on artificial intelligence with their declaration al in the nordic-baltic region, the nordic and baltic countries have agreed to cooperate on artificial intelligence to secure digital skills, access to data based on common standards, ethical guidelines for artificial intelligence, and to promote development of the technology in europe_ national strategy for artificial intelligence march   put good



this strategy is a first step the strategy contains  initiatives. the government has earmarked dkk  million (eur . million) for - . this is a supplement to the dkk  million (eur . million) allocated in the finance act  from the research reserve for research into new technological possibilities and digital technologies and for a national centre for research into digital technologies_ the government has also proposed a new investment fund to expedite the dissemination of digital welfare solutions. together with initiatives already launched, the investment fund will have a total investment budget of dkk  million (eur . million) for -. this strategy sets a direction, and a number of specific projects will be launched to help denmark reap the full benefits of the opportunities artificial intelligence will provide over the years to come: however; this is only one step on the way. sustained efforts are required if the vision is to be realised new challenges will arise, and it will be necessary to adjust initiatives along the way. and there will be needs for new initiatives as the technology develops  therefore, the government will monitor developments and evaluate the strategy annually: the government will also regularly receive input from professional networks, decision makers, researchers, political stakeholders, etc. with a strong focus on ethics, better use of data, and the importance of competences and research, the government is also sowing the seeds for denmark to play a role in developing artificial intelligence in the long term. several of the research projects currently being launched around the world and in denmark; are aiming to break new scientific ground, the significance of which could take  years to become apparent with denmark's strong research communities, there is a basis to influence developments in the long term _  national strategy for artificial intelligence march  good very



central initiatives in the strategy principles for responsible development and use of artificial intelligence the development and use of artificial intelligence these principles will be supplemented with initiatives to strengthen cyber security, creating legal clarity as well as ensuring responsible and transparent use of artificial intelligence in the public sector: common danish language resource a common danish language resource will be established to support and accelerate the development of language-technologv solutions in danish: the language resource will be freely available; enabling suppliers to build on existing knowledge to create new solutions within voice recognition and language understanding to benefit citizens, authorities and businesses more open public-sector data for artificial intelligence in collaboration with businesses and research communities; the government will identify five public-sector datasets during  and ,which can be made available for businesses, researchers and public authorities and contribute to the development of artificial intelligence: the datasets willnot contain personal data, but rather environment and climate data from the transportation sector: signature projects in the public sector there is a lack of experience in use of artificial intelligence in the public sector: therefore; the government will launch a number of signature projects within health, the social and employment areas, and cross-sector case processing: stronger investment in danish businesses it is proposed to launch a pilot project in the form ofan investment pool of dkk  million (eur . million) over four years targeting at companies with a business model based on artificial intelligence: the prerequisite for this isa  percent financing from the private sector amounting to a total investment pool of dkk  million (eur . million) the fund will be managed by the danish growth fund. national strategy for artificial intelligence march  







focus areas







a responsible foundation for artificial intelligence there must be a responsible ethical and legal framework for the use of artificial intelligence: artificial intelligence holds a potential for growth, innovation and better public services_ however , increased use of artificial intelligence also raises a number of ethical and legal issues in both the public and private sectors_ many of these issues are well-known from previous work with data. others are new issues regarding the responsibility for decision-making, transparency and discrimination;, for example. stronger confidence denmark has performed well when it comes to digitisation, both in the public and private sectors. denmark has also managed to preserve high confidence in the public sector from both individuals and the business community. a total of % of danes have confidence in the management of personal information by the public authorities (statistics denmark; ). in world-class digital services, the government has set a goal to increase this to % before 2024_ realising this goal and the potentials in artificial intelligence requires a common ethical basis for development and use of artificial intelligence. this will also support confidence in work by both the public sector and by businesses on data and new technologies_ therefore, the government has set up six ethical principles, and these will form the framework for future development and use of artificial intelligence. a number of initiatives to promote a strong focus on data ethics will also be launched: development and use of artificial intelligence must be within the relevant legislative framework_ use of personal data should always respect the basic principles in the general data protection regulation the legislative framework is in the general data protection regulation, administrative law; etc , and these regulate work with artificial intelligence , through among other things national strategy for artificial intelligence march   great



requirements in connection with processing personal data. in the future, the use of technology is expected to raise new legal and ethical issues_ therefore , the government will monitor developments closely and regularly assess the need for guidelines on interpretation of the current legal framework as well as the need for new legislation, as more experience is obtained with the technology and its possibilities. the government's initiatives should also be considered in the context of international developments in the area, where there is an increasing interest to ethical use of artificial intelligence both at the eu level and globally_ by taking the lead, denmark can influence developments, and help ensure that the public and private sectors focus on responsibility when using artificial intelligence_ this will improve the conditions for providing services closer to citizens based on their needs, and it will give businesses a competitive edge _ security is paramount security is also crucial to ensure responsible development and use of artificial intelligence_ individuals, businesses and employees must be confident that data and algorithms have been safeguarded against manipulation and attack; and that the results produced by artificial intelligence are reliable. on the one hand, the spread of artificial intelligence entails a risk of exacerbating existing cyber threats and creating entirely new risks. at worst; technologies artificial intelligence could be influenced for malicious use. for example, artificial intelligence could be used to automate cyber attacks on critical infrastructure and on danish companies_ on the other hand, artificial intelligence will provide opportunities for danish businesses to develop advanced it security solutions that exploit the potentials in the technology: for example, the new technology makes it possible for systems to automatically reveal unknown viruses and attempts at incursion never seen before. case: intelligent cyber security the american company ibm has launched the qradar program using artificial intelligence, qradar can examine billions of pieces of information in a short period of time and look for signs that a network or system has been compromised by malicious players. in this way the program can help it specialists find breaches of security that would be hard for a human to detect_ new it security solutions based on artificial intelligence can potentially create new export opportunities and increase it security. however, wherever these new it security solutions are used, they will also entail potential risks if are manipulated:  national strategy for artificial intelligence march  using they



the government will ensure that data, for example personal data on citizens, continues to be managed appropriately, and that artificial intelligence, its algorithms and results are trustworthy. government initiatives the government will implement the following initiatives: ethical principles for artificial intelligence  establishment of the data ethics council . security and artificial intelligence  _ legal clarity on development and use of artificial intelligence . transparent use of algorithms by the public sector . ethically responsible and sustainable use of data by the business community  _ danish imprint on standards for artificial intelligence the initiatives supplement existing efforts: world-class digital services danish cyber and information security strategy, including strategies for sectors critical for society. strategy for denmark's digital growth initiative .: ethical principles for artificial intelligence work on artificial intelligence raises a number of ethical issues_ for example, is it possible to secure the basic rights of citizens, due process and fundamental societal values when using artificial intelligence? therefore, the government has prepared six ethical principles to set a common framework for development and use of artificial intelligence. a common ethical framework is a precondition for maintaining the high level of confidence and trust in denmark: the ethical principles aim at authorities, businesses, research institutions and others working with artificial intelligence_ the principles reflect danish values and have been prepared on the basis of the recommendations from the expert group on data ethics set up under the danish disruption council, and the draft eu ethical principles and guidelines for artificial intelligence. the government will regularly follow up on the principles, among other things after discussions with the data ethics council. the follow-up will take into account the differences between the public and private sectors_ the public sector is subject to the danish public administration act and the danish access to public administration files act; for example, whereas businesses may need to protect trade secrets_ national strategy for artificial intelligence march  



six principles for artificial intelligence self-determination 2_ dignity 3_ responsibility explainability 5_ equality and justice 6_ development . self-determination people's autonomy should have priority in development and use of artificial intelligence. like today, people should be able to make informed and independent decisions without artificial intelligence removing their self-determination: . dignity human dignity should be respected in development and use of artificial intelligence artificial intelligence should not cause injury, it should support due process and it should not unjustifiably place people in a worse position. artificial intelligence should respect democracy and democratic processes, and it should not be used to infringe fundamental human rights: . responsibility aii levels should be responsible for the consequences of their development and use of artificial intelligence, i.e. developers, cooperation partners, users, authorities, businesses, etc. in decisions and decision-support based on artificial intelligence , it should be possible to place responsibility on human beings . explainability explainability means that you can describe, control and restore data, underlying logics and consequences of the use of artificial intelligence, e.g: by being able to trace and explain decisions and decision support: explainability is not the same as full transparency of algorithms, as there are business interests in the private sector, for example. however, the public authorities have a special responsibility to ensure openness and transparency in the use of algorithms_ . equality and justice artificial intelligence should not reproduce prejudices that marginalise specific population groups there will be active work to prevent unwanted bias and promote designs that avoid classification discriminating on ethnicity, sexuality and gender, for example. demographic and professional diversity should be guiding parameters in working with artificial intelligence.  national strategy for artificial intelligence march 



. development artificial intelligence can help great progress for society. technical and organisational solutions should be developed that support ethically responsible development and use of artificial intelligence in order to achieve the greatest possible progress for society, by contributing to better public-sector services and to growth in the business community_ initiative .: establishment of the data ethics council the government will establish the data ethics council in  to make recommendations and support broad public debate on issues regarding data ethics, including artificial intelligence_ the council will monitor technological development and help to ensure that ethical issues are taken up so that the many advantages of using data can be supported in an ethically appropriate manner: the council will discuss how to ensure that technological opportunities are exploited such that they serve the shared values of danish society in the future_ initiative .: security and artificial intelligence solutions based on artificial intelligence must be secure and tested to confirm can withstand systematic attacks_ the government will therefore launch an initiative to support secure development and deployment of artificial intelligence. this will ensure that confidence in digital solutions is preserved, and this is an important precondition for realising the societal benefits of more digitisation and wider use of artificial intelligence_ the initiative will analyse the security risks that may arise for authorities and businesses from increased use of artificial intelligence. existing risks and threats will be exacerbated, for example if cyber attacks are automated, or intelligent malware is used. at the same time entirely new and previously unknown risks will arise, e.g: if the data basis for smart solutions is compromised:. this initiative will also involve preparation of guidelines to assign specific initiatives to strengthen work by the authorities and businesses on it security and data protection. for example, there will be specific examples of contractual requirements concerning security that the authorities can impose on suppliers of artificial intelligence_ another part of the initiative will involve implementing initiatives to enhance the development and implementation in danish businesses of it security solutions based on artificial intelligence_ together, these activities will forge a safe and secure framework for introducing artificial intelligence in the public sector and in businesses_ the initiative will also help ensure that the technology can be used proactively in cyber security in denmark: national strategy for artificial intelligence march   forge e.g: they



the initiative should be seen in the context of the government's  national strategy for and information security: in the years to come, dkk . billion (eur  million) will be invested in work by the ministry of defence on cyber and information security. furthermore six targeted strategies have been drawn up for work in the most critical sectors on cyber and information security in accordance with the principle of sector responsibility _ initiative .: legal clarity on development and use of artificial intelligence greater use of artificial intelligence raises a number f legal issues. for example, who is responsible if a self-driving car is involved in an accident? is it the 'driver' because should have intervened? is it the manufacturer or developers of the self-learning intelligent system? driverless cars have not yet been developed commercially, but the introduction of artificial intelligence is already showing that there is a number of questions about legal responsibility to be addressed in more detail:. therefore , the government will set up an inter-ministerial working group to examine whether the issues in artificial intelligence can be managed within the existing legislative framework_ the working group will identify the need for guidelines on the regulations that apply in relation to the use of artificial intelligence, and there may be a need to launch legislative initiatives at national or eu level. the work of the working group could also form a basis for dialogue with the european commission on any need for regulatory measures. initiative .: transparent use of artificial intelligence by the public sector citizens and businesses must have confidence in artificial intelligence whenever it is used by the public authorities, so that artificial intelligence does not undermine public confidence in the public authorities generally. this applies in particular when the authorities use artificial intelligence to support decision-making: on the basis of the ethical principles, the government will ensure that common public- sector methods and guidelines are drawn up which support the statutory requirements for transparency etc. as part of this work;, pilot project will be initiated to develop and test methods for how public authorities actually ensure the statutory requirements for reasonable, responsible and transparent use of artificial intelligence as a basis for making decisions_  national strategy for artificial intelligence march  cyber they using



initiative .: ethically responsible and sustainable use of data by the business community as a follow-up to the recommendations from the government's expert group on data ethics, the government will launch a number of initiatives targeted at the business community. the expert group has looked at how work by businesses on responsible use of data can be supported so that it becomes competitive advantage for danish and european businesses_ among other things, the government will prepare a toolbox with specific tools such as guidelines to enterprises in their routine work with data responsibility. the government will also present a proposed legislative amendment to the danish financial statements act so that the largest danish companies have to report on their data-ethics policy: furthermore, a data-ethics label will be introduced for businesses that comply with the ethical principles for data utilisation, to display on their website, for example_ this will make it easier for consumers to navigate between businesses, services and products and choose the data- ethically responsible alternative preparation of the toolbox, amendments to the financial statements act and the data-ethics label will be carried out on the basis of ethical principles: finally, the government make active efforts for relevant initiatives to be introduced in the eu in order to ensure equal competitive conditions for danish businesses in the eu single market. initiative .: danish imprint on standards for artificial intelligence the international race is on to influence the development of new standards within artificial intelligence. as far as possible, the government wants the forthcoming international standards to be prepared on the basis of the needs of danish businesses, as the standards will form the basis for future regulation of artificial intelligence at european and international levels in order to gain real influence on european standardisation work; the government has successfully acquired responsibility for the secretariat of the upcoming european focus group that is to identify the needs for standardisation within artificial intelligence_ with the secretariat in denmark, danish businesses will be able to make a strong imprint on the work: in parallel, the government will initiate work to develop national technical specifications based on the specific needs of danish businesses this work will take its outset in the six ethical principles for artificial intelligence_ national strategy for artificial intelligence march   help will

more and better data data is the prerequisite for artificial intelligence. the danish point of departure is good, but we can go even further. data is the raw material of the future and it is an essential prerequisite for the use of artificial intelligence. the quality and volume of data determines how far it is possible to go with artificial intelligence_ businesses, public authorities and researchers need large datasets that can be linked across areas to develop new solutions with artificial intelligence. for example, data on water consumption can be used by waterworks to develop solutions to provide better and more stable water supply by finding and predicting leaks in pipes. data on consumers' online purchases and locations can help shops predict when consumers will a given product_ municipalities can collect and analyse data on education and age to develop targeted employment measures for the individual. in the healthcare area, data on sickness and hospital discharges could form the basis for solutions to ensure better and more cohesive treatment for patients_ this is good; for the individual citizen, for businesses and for the economy_ good access to public data several initiatives have already secured better access to public data these include the basic data program, which, since , has made available data on real property, addresses, roads and areas, water and climate, geography, persons and businesses_ and this work is continuing- in , the government decided to release weather and climate data from the danish meteorological institute. up to , a large number of datasets on weather observations and forecasts will be made freely available for everyone. this will make it possible for electricity plants, for example, to develop solutions that adjust production of electricity to wind and weather conditions, or for businesses to develop new apps for consumers. with its health data programme, the government has also earmarked dkk  mill: to ensure better data quality and data bases and to strengthen cross-sectoral cooperation on health data. national strategy for artificial intelligence march   buy



through membership of the european space agency (esa) and the two eu space programmes, copernicus and galileo, denmark is also helping to gather and process large amounts of weather, environment and climate data_ most of this data is freely available for citizens, businesses, public authorities and researchers_ if danish businesses are to exploit the potential in artificial intelligence and strengthen denmark's position as a digital frontrunner; it is vital that they have access to data. uncertainty about the rules should not constitute a barrier to using and sharing data as a source of innovation and growth in the danish business community. therefore, as part of the strategy for denmark's digital growth, the government has prepared guidance materials for businesses about the rules for ownership and rights in connection with the use and sharing of data. this will ensure clarity about the rules for businesses and their use of data as a result hereof, the danish point of departure is very good, but we can go even further: there is still low use of data, e.g: big data by danish businesses, and several public datasets are still not available for researchers and businesses. moreover, there is still too little use of the datasets that are available to develop new, smart solutions better opportunities for danish solutions with this national strategy for artificial intelligence, the danish government is launching range of initiatives to release more and better danish non-personal data, and to make businesses' frameworks for the use of data even better. however, more use of data also places more demands on businesses and the public sector: the government will ensure that citizens are involved when data is made available. citizens should be no doubt that both businesses and the public authorities use and store data responsibly_ among other things, this requires that the public authorities have access to good and secure solutions to store data the government will launch an initiative to give government authorities access to secure environments for data storage, as well as access to develop and test artificial intelligence by examining access to cloud technology: furthermore, there will be work to give businesses better access to closed, secure environments, where this is permitted by legislation: many of the technological solutions we know today have been developed in english, and the goal has to be, that solutions developed and used in danish are of equal quality_ in line with increasing internationalisation of society, it is important to ensure that the danish language remains strong if individuals and businesses are to have access to up-to-date digital solutions in danish_ therefore, the government will enhance opportunities to develop solutions in danish by establishing freely available danish language resource: the language resource will enable businesses, researchers and public authorities to securely and efficiently develop solutions using voice recognition and language understanding in danish. finally, the government will also focus on how the eu can establish better access to public- sector data across countries and how sharing data between businesses can be strengthened.  national strategy for artificial intelligence march

initiative .: common danish language resource danish is a small language area, and this means that the majority of language-technology solutions do not work optimally in danish. this is a challenge, because language technology is often an integral part of the digital solutions we use every day. language-technology solutions are used to speak with virtual assistants, e.g: to read out bus stops over speakers in busses and to translate between languages_ in step with the development of ever more advanced digital solutions in english that people can interact with, there is a risk that interaction could be increasingly in english rather than danish: if citizens and danish businesses are to continue to have access and possibilities to develop good solutions in danish, danish must continue as a strong language in international competition_ language technology in the form of voice recognition and language understanding is a pivotal precondition for the development and use of artificial intelligence in danish: it enables us to analyse, recognise and reproduce language within reading aloud and translation for example sweden, norway and other countries comparable to denmark are also prioritising and investing in the area for example, language technology can be used tohelp people with sight disabilities or people who find itdifficult to read and write by reading texts aloud or record messages. language technology also helps physicians to make diagnoses quicker because physicians can dictate observations instead writing them down later: this saves time that can be spentwith patients instead. a common danish language resource a structured collection of digital datasets (sound,text and words) freely available to everyone the spoken language word and term bases the written language collection of sound files dictionaries (words, (voice and dialogue word classes), recordings) , dialects; terminologv banks transcribed sound files (specialist term bases) collection of texts, text corpora, grammar; annotated text  national strategy for artificial intelligence march 



today, a significant barrier to developing danish language technology is that developing digital language resources requires large investments for individual players this is a problem for danish competitiveness, knowledge-development; and future digitisation of denmark _ in businesses, in the public sector and in research_ an open and shared language resource will provide new research opportunities and strengthen development of solutions in the public and private sectors within artificial intelligence. for example, solutions will be developed to help companies transcribe phone calls so that customer enquiries can be answered faster it will also be easier for the public authorities to develop solutions for citizen service centres, for example high-quality chatbots to help citizens more quickly and easily. therefore, in collaboration with both private and public players, the government will start development of a language resource that will be freely available for everyone this will ensure that businesses, researchers and public authorities have access to a high-quality shared language resource the language resource will build on existing initiatives in the public sector and private sector as well as in research communities. this will be in collaboration between public and private players initiative .: better access to public-sector data denmark has public-sector data of high quality. we need to exploit this and turn it into an international competitive advantage_ therefore, in collaboration with the business community and research communities, the government will identify five public-sector datasets during  and , which can be made accessible for businesses, researchers and public authorities as non-personal data, thereby contributing to the development of artificial intelligence. national strategy for artificial intelligence march  



examples of datasets which can be released language data image and statistical from different data in the sources where text environmental area location data in the and sound data can which can support transport area which be used to develop the development of can relieve congestion chatbots or other new green solutions; and help urban services that can for example by planning by analysing improve both public analysing weather traffic patterns and private services. and climate data: in parallel, the government will ensure that; through test projects, businesses and researchers are given the opportunity to test and develop new innovative solutions public-sector data. the initiative's work on access to public-sector data will contribute to resolving societal issues like climate challenges and congestion: this work will also inspire more innovation, new thinking and use of artificial intelligence across businesses, research communities and public authorities_ this national strategy for artificial intelligence will launch initiatives to ensure that more non-personal public-sector data is made available. however, there is also a need for more strategic initiatives, so that; in the longer term, denmark can fully exploit the potentials of denmark's good public-sector datasets. therefore, with world-class digital services, the government has taken initiative to prepare a strategy for data in the public sector. this strategy will help the public sector become better at using data to provide citizens and businesses with more cohesive and targeted services. as part of this, public authorities will work together to create a cohesive high-quality data basis that provides a digital foundation for good, correct and efficient services for citizens and businesses_ the strategy will set a clear framework for the use of public-sector data to ensure and increase public confidence in public-sector work with data.  national strategy for artificial intelligence march  using



initiative .: more data in the cloud for artificial intelligence it should be easier for public authorities to develop and work with artificial intelligence. cloud technologies can be a precondition for working with artificial intelligence, as these technologies give cheap access to massive computational power and storage capacity. at the same time, cloud technologies make it easier to work together across datasets_ in future, the government therefore wants to provide authorities with a basis for taking an active position on whether data should be stored in the cloud. the government will launch a number of activities addressing the challenges and opportunities of using cloud solutions what are cloud technologies? cloud technologies is an overall term for solutions for servers and applications, that can be accessed via the internet: cloud technologies are advantageous, as they can quickly be scaled up and down according to user needs. by storing data in cloud solutions, authorities can buy access to the (processing) power necessary to work with artificial intelligence. an analysis will be conducted of how to make it easier for authorities to start secure cloud solutions. guidelines will also be prepared for public authorities that are to decide on the use of cloud solutions: moreover; the government will promote central government use of cloud technologies by establishing secure cloud environments for government authorities linked to statens it. cloud environments will be offered to public authorities wanting to explore how can quickly started with work on artificial intelligence or data analysis initiative .: improved access to data outside denmark for danish businesses and researchers it should be easier for danish businesses to access data abroad, particularly in the eu. at the european level, efforts are being made to ensure better access to data, among others, for businesses and research communities_ new european frameworks for making available public-sector data create an opportunity for danish businesses to deploy data-based business models across the whole of the eu. the government will work to ensure that the data that eu member states are obligated to make available is of value to danish businesses, authorities and researchers_ national strategy for artificial intelligence march   using they get



towards a common european data space the eu coordinated plan on artificial intelligence states that more data from public authorities and businesses should be shared and made available across national borders_ the first step towards common european data space is the psi directive, which will ensure that all eu member states make certain spatial data, environmental data, weather data etc. freely available at the european level. the next step is to review the european frameworks for re-use of business data and the ongoing trials of data pools. in the research area, efforts are being made to improve frameworks for sharing and re-using research data across europe through the european open science cloud, where denmark is participating in governing bodies _ the initiative entails harmonisation of access principles, infrastructure and data management: the european commission will also carry out a review of the european framework for re-use of business data, including copyrights, display of data, as well as guidelines for data transfer in connection with changes of service providers. denmark influence this work to improve the possibilities of access to data, whilst complying with the principles of responsible use of artificial intelligence_ this will benefit the competitiveness of businesses. finally, denmark work to ensure a good framework for sharing data between businesses in the annual review of the eu plan on artificial intelligence. this applies in particular to the european commission's proposal on data pools, which the government will monitor closely:  national strategy for artificial intelligence march  will will











strong i competences and new knowledge digital competences are to using artificial intelligence: in order to make the best use of the opportunities offered by artificial intelligence, businesses and the public sector must have access to employees with the right competences_ this applies in particular to it specialists with experience in developing and using artificial intelligence it specialists typically use their technical expertise for example computer scientists develop algorithms. however; this also applies to employees with more general digital and technical competences, who can apply the technology in their day-to-day work. for example, an administrative employee who has to understand and act on recommendations from an it system: technology only adds value in its interaction with people. this means that artificial intelligence should not replace people, but instead be used by people to improve conditions for individuals and for society. therefore, there is a need to improve digital competences and digital understanding in the entire population, so that we can benefit from the possibilities of the technology. this means that it is important to train more young people with the right competences to use artificial intelligence. however; it is also important to upgrade the skills and qualifications of existing employees, so that can carry out their tasks in new ways and with new technological devices _ today, it specialists constitute just over % of the employed in denmark: in a survey of danish businesses, % of businesses that have tried to recruit it specialists state that are facing challenges with regard to recruiting it specialists (statistics denmark; ). at the european level, there is an estimated demand of , it programming specialists. this demand is expected to increase in the years to come (eu, ). on some parameters, things are going in the right direction: the intake to higher education it programmes in denmark rose by % in the period - (coordinated enrolment system, ). denmark ranks fourth out of  oecd countries in terms of training young national strategy for artificial intelligence march   key - they they



individuals within information and communications technology (oecd, ). however; focus must be maintained for denmark to become a frontrunner in development and use of artificial intelligence case: new education programmes on artificial intelligence new programmes on artificial intelligence are constantly being set up. for example, in  the technical university of denmark set up a new bsc programme on artificial intelligence and data. in , the university of copenhagen will set up a new bsc programme on machine learning and data science_ on danish artificial intelligence programmes, students not only work with large amounts of data and algorithms, they also discuss the ethical choices that will often be part of programming and designing algorithms_ strong research culture there is a global race within research in artificial intelligence, in which countries such as the us and china are investing massively in research in the technology: even though denmark does not measure up to large nations in terms of scope of research, denmark stands strong as a research nation with good research environments within artificial intelligence. and denmark is proportionally among the largest global investors in public research_ in order to help support development of artificial intelligence, denmark must strengthen research efforts within the area: denmark must ensure that future research talents have conditions to provide useful technological solutions for individual, businesses and the public sector: this will fulfil the potentials offered by artificial intelligence in the short term: but it will also pave the way for scientific ground-breaking results, contributing to the fundamental development of the technology in the long term enhanced research efforts will also help ensure that denmark can influence the development of artificial intelligence according to danish values. strong focus on responsibility and ethics is already a consistent feature in danish research into the technology_ as a small country, denmark cannot build the necessary infrastructure on its own. on the other hand, the eu will be investing massively in building research infrastructure within artificial intelligence in the years to come_ in this context, denmark needs to ensure easy access to the most recent technological facilities for danish researchers and businesses_ for example, in  denmark joined the european high performance computing joint undertaking (eurohpc) , which is to develop a future european supercomputer that can process huge amounts of data for use in climate-change and cyber-security research, for example:  national strategy for artificial intelligence march  good



the government will act on several fronts, which together will establish a solid basis for developing and using artificial intelligence. a number of initiatives will support strong research efforts while at the same time strengthening employee competences and understanding of technology to maximise denmark's new technological possibilities in the long term. a solid foundation the government has already launched several initiatives to improve the frameworks for strengthened digital competences and understanding of technology as well as research into new technologies, including artificial intelligence. the new initiatives should therefore be seen in the context of existing initiatives_ teknologipagten (technology pact) and the future stem action plan will raise the skills of the workforce, and it is important that more young individuals are encouraged to take digital and technological education programmes focusing on artificial intelligence, for example. in teknologipagten, the government has set a goal that in  years denmark will have about , more people with higher or vocational qualifications within the so-called stem disciplines_ the government has launched a talent programme to provide the most talented and motivated students with better opportunities and greater challenges, so become even more skilled within their fields. the government will set aside a pool of dkk  million (eur  million) to cover all technical fields, including new technologies like artificial intelligence. as of the government's strategy for denmark's digital growth, a trial programme has been launched to enhance understanding of technology in compulsory programmes at municipal primary and lower-secondary schools the objective is to ensure that all students learn to reflect critically about technology and shape it rather than use it. as of the follow-up to recommendations from the expert committee on quality in higher education in denmark; in the coming years the universities will work on integrating into programmes competences such as coding, data analysis and understanding of technology: the aim is that students be trained in reflecting on, and being critical about, ethical and societal consequences of technological developments and that a better understanding of the digital technologies and possibilities of individual education programmes. based on the work by disruptionradet (disruption council) , a number of projects will also be carried out to improve the digital competences of teachers on relevant higher education programmes. this will put teachers in a better position to use digital solutions and to link understanding of technology with their academic core competences as well as strengthen their understanding of, and critical position on, digital technologies such as artificial intelligence_ denmark currently has innovation centres in eight cities to build a bridge to some of the strongest partners within research, higher education and business development in some of the world's leading innovation communities_ the centres also support collaboration on artificial intelligence between danish and international researchers and businesses. for example, the innovation centre in silicon valley and the danish academy of technical sciences together offer an ""applied al academy"" an exclusive and intensive training course for danish technology leaders from knowledge institutions, public authorities and businesses. national strategy for artificial intelligence march   they part part they gain



moreover, partnership agreements with american elite universities have been entered into through the innovation centres in silicon valley, which each year offer up to  danish phd students and researchers within, for example artificial intelligence, a place at massachusetts institute of technology (mit) and at the center for information technology research in the interest of society (citris) at uc berkeley: in the  state budget; the danish government has allocated dkk  million (eur  million) to innovation fund denmark to conduct research into new technological possibilities the budget also allocates dkk  million (eur . million) to the independent research fund denmark to conduct research into digital technologies, including artificial intelligence. in the years ahead, the government will continue to prioritize research into digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence_ as part of the funds allocated for research into new technological possibilities under innovation fund denmark dkk  million (eur . million) will be earmarked for a national centre for research into new digital technologies the centre will help build the talent pool in the area, so that; in the future, denmark will have an even better basis for influencing the development of artificial intelligence. furthermore, innovation fund denmark's implementation of funding for strategic and challenge-driven research also be based on the forsk2o25 catalogue. one of the four overall themes in the catalogue new technological possibilities provides a natural focus on new technology and digitisation in research investments_ case: artificial intelligence provides better food safety today, x-ray inspection requires unique solutions for each product to be tested. for example, one solution is used to find out whether a potato is rotten, whereas another solution is used to find out whether cold cuts have been contaminated with metal chips. innovation fund denmark is supporting a project to develop quality control of food, for example, x-ray inspection: the aim of using artificial intelligence is to eliminate the need to develop unique software solutions for each individual product; allowing the system automatically to learn to distinguish between good and faulty products artificial intelligence requires access to large amounts of data. full exploitation of the possibilities in the development of data requires a supportive digital research infrastructure that can handle transport, processing and storage of data: a strategy for national collaboration on digital research infrastructure has therefore been prepared to provide the best possible digital tools   national strategy for artificial intelligence march  will using



government initiatives artificial intelligence places new demands on the labour market and competences_ consequently, the government has already launched a number of initiatives in the area_ the government will continue its work and at the same time implement further initiatives focusing particularly on artificial intelligence. the government will implement the following initiatives: dialogue with research funding foundations on artificial intelligence. . stronger digital competences in central government . strong danish participation in the eu framework programme for research and innovation . stronger digital competences through adult; continuing and further education the initiatives supplement existing efforts: teknologipagten (technology pact): more young people on technological and digital education programmes talent programme for the most talented students on higher education programmes improved digital competences and better understanding of technology in primary and lower secondary schools and in higher education priority of more funding for research into new technological possibilities and digital technologies national centre for research into new digital technologies stronger digital research infrastructure initiative .: dialogue with public research funding foundations on artificial intelligence the public research funding foundations implement funding for research projects in open competition on the basis of a professional assessment of quality and relevance. some research communities are, however, experiencing that research into artificial intelligence and data science does not always fit into the programmes and application categories of the foundations the government will therefore engage in dialogue with the foundations to clarify whether there are appropriate and clear support options for research projects within artificial intelligence and data science, including inter-disciplinary research_ national strategy for artificial intelligence march  



initiative .: stronger digital competences in central government the need for employees with technological understanding and competences is increasing in line with more authorities using artificial intelligence_ one of the ambitions of the government in the strategy for ict management in central government is to enhance digital competences in central government: for example, the government will establish a digitisation academy offering continuing training courses to generalists in central government: in order to improve the competences of government it specialists, the government will engage in dialogue with danish universities working with artificial intelligence at a high level with a view to developing courses aimed at it specialists_ the courses will include the latest research results and be based on specific experience and projects from relevant authorities. initiative .: strong danish participation in the eu framework programme for research and innovation the eu framework programme for research and innovation has increased focus on artificial intelligence_ the government work for strong danish participation in the area this work will help ensure that potential danish applicants have a clear understanding of their possibilities within artificial intelligence in the framework programme (both the current horizon  and the future horizon europe), and it will forge better conditions for applicants through guidance. initiative .: stronger digital competences through adult, continuing and further education as a result of technological developments, there is a constant need to be able to offer opportunities for upgrading skills. the tripartite agreement from october  focus on creating a vocational adult education and training system that is better geared to strengthening digital competences of the entire work force and to adapting to the changing needs of the labour market_ in order to support this, a transition fund of dkk  million (eur . million) annually was set up. in addition to the transition fund dkk  million (eur . million) is allocated to additional activities_ in collaboration with the social partners and representatives from higher education institutions, the government has set up a vocational adult education and training working group which, among other things, will advise on the competence needs of the labour market in the light of technological and digital developments_ as part of this national strategy for artificial intelligence, the working group will examine whether there is a need to launch initiatives on the basis of the development of artificial intelligence, for example in the form of new education programmes, analyses and development projects_ an annual amount of dkk  million (eur ,) has been allocated for initiatives by the working group:  national strategy for artificial intelligence march  will put











increased investment iv in artificial intelligence access to risk capital and more experience with artificial intelligence are crucial for businesses and authorities to develop, test and start using the technology: investment in both the private and the public sector is necessary if the growth and prosperity potentials from artificial intelligence are to be realised in denmark: few danish investments in artificial intelligence, - % of private investment . . . . . . . .                 note: the figure shows venture capital, private equity and manda investments in artificial inte iligence and big data companies in the period - in relation to total private investments. the leading position of israel is driven by a strong start-up community within artificial intelligence_ the level of investment for  was calculated in november . the figure does not cover internal investments in businesses_ nord indicates the countries finland, sweden, the uk and germany: source: the impact of artificial intelligence in denmark; mckinsey . national strategy for artificial intelligence march  



denmark is currently lagging behind comparable countries such as finland, norway and sweden with regard to private investment in artificial intelligence_ in the long term, this may challenge the competitiveness of danish businesses even though some danish businesses are at an advanced stage with artificial intelligence, the level of use in denmark remains relatively low. only % of businesses are currently using the technology: of all large danish businesses with  or more employees, only one in five uses artificial intelligence_ there is thus still a large untapped potential. large businesses use more artificial intelligence,  % of companies    employees  -   -   -  + note: data only available for businesses with more than  employees. artificial intelligence is measured as the use of machine learning: source: statistics denmark . a similar picture exists for the public sector. a survey of danish municipalities shows that only % of municipalities are currently artificial intelligence to improve their services_ however; as many as % expect to have implemented the technology in some areas within the next three years (kmd analyse, ). in order to stimulate investment in artificial intelligence in both the public and the private sectors, it is therefore necessary to generate, gather and disseminate experience with the technology and its uses. this will increase the knowledge of employees and leaders about what artificial intelligence can and cannot be used for. at the same time, this will promote more well-established market for consultancy and services within artificial intelligence_  national strategy for artificial intelligence march  using



the government will therefore launch a number of initiatives to promote investment in the public sector and among businesses developing danish solutions. the initiatives are to help boost development; testing and use of artificial intelligence by improving access to capital, consultancy services and experience in the area. pilot project on digital inquiries in the education sector the danish ministry of education is an example of a public authority that receives many inquiries from both institutions and citizens. therefore, a pilot project will be launched as part of the national strategy for artificial intelligence on use of chatbots by the ministry of education. a chatbot could be used in direct contact with citizens, but it could also serve as support tool for employees who engage in dialogue with citizens. furthermore , the government will work to attract to denmark international businesses with core competences within artificial intelligence this will attract specialist knowledge and labour to denmark and create an entrepreneurial environment for artificial intelligence in denmark: the initiatives will support implementation of artificial intelligence in the public sector: the ambition of the government is to allocate with the municipalities and the regions dkk  million (almost eur  million) to establish an investment fund to test and deploy new technologies and digital welfare solutions in municipalities and regions. together with initiatives already launched, the fund will have a total investment budget of dkk  million (eur  million) up to . especially businesses are dependent on being able to test new products and solutions. therefore, performance contracts have been set up with seven danish gts institutes (approved technological service institutes) to test new solutions. more than dkk  million (eur . million) have been set aside to develop technological services for danish businesses for the period -. this will supplement the funding that has been set aside under innovation fund denmark, which also promotes new technological solutions, see focus area 3_ national strategy for artificial intelligence march  



government initiatives the government will implement the following initiatives: signature projects 2_ more investment in danish businesses 3_ exploration of the possibility of an investment agreement with the eu 4_ increased knowledge-sharing across public authorities 5_ denmark as an attractive growth environment the initiatives supplement existing efforts: investment fund for new digital technologies and digital welfare solutions performance contracts with gts institutes (approved technological service provider) strategy for denmark's digital growth initiative .: signature projects using artificial intelligence holds great potential to offer better and more effective treatment in the healthcare system, more targeted case processing in the social sector, as well as quicker case processing at citizen service centres and in many other areas with world-class digital services, the government has launched a new investment fund aimed at municipalities and regions to boost the use of artificial intelligence and dissemination of digital welfare solutions_ however; there is a lack of experience. the government will implement a number of signature projects as quickly as possible to gather experiences of the use of artificial intelligence in the public sector_ the projects will test the technology in areas with potential to enhance the quality and productivity of public-sector core tasks; however, specific experience in these areas is currently insufficient_ experience from these projects will contribute to mature solutions that can be used in all of denmark the signature projects will be based on a public operating task; in which a solution with artificial intelligence that can provide better services for citizens has been developed in collaboration between the public sector and the private sector. the government has selected three areas where signature projects will be launched: healthcare, the social and employment areas as well as cross-authority case processing: common for the three areas is the large volume of tasks, and using artificial intelligence can  national strategy for artificial intelligence march 



thereby benefit many citizens. at the same time, due to the abundance of data, these three areas provide a good basis for testing artificial intelligence_ within each area, projects will be selected in collaboration with municipalities and regions in connection with the annual budget agreements_ the projects selected will receive funding to test the use of artificial intelligence. signature projects will be followed up and new signature projects will be launched in the strategy period for -. ail signature projects will be implemented in accordance with the ethical principles that constitute the common framework for development and use of artificial intelligence. healthcare areas artificial intelligence can help improve the healthcare sector by improving patient treatment and optimising hospital operation: in addition to signature projects, objectives for healthcare will be set (see the chapter on priority areas) which support the proposed healthcare reform and a stronger , close and cohesive healthcare system, and thus have a structural and long- term perspective_ example of a signature project: healthcare areas artificial intelligence for quality development in primary healthcare: in primary healthcare, the technology can be used to support the work of general practitioners with help from the technology, physicians will be able to notify the normal test results and identify abnormal test results more quickly. artificial intelligence can also serve as decision support and, for example by assisting physicians in common tasks and diagnosing rare diseases. within healthcare, artificial intelligence is likely to help quicker and better treatment in areas such as planning cancer treatment; predicting the course of diseases, time-critical diagnostics in the acute area as well as decision support for general practitioners regarding rare diseases_ social and employment areas in the social area, artificial intelligence can contribute to more individualised efforts, so that citizens are referred to the right place from the very beginning: case officers can receive decision support for preventive and individualised efforts on the basis of knowledge from previous cases_ national strategy for artificial intelligence march  



example of a signature project: social and employment areas artificial intelligence for targeted employment efforts using artificial intelligence will potentially shorten unemployment periods. analysing patterns in historical data on successful efforts will make it easier for case officers to target employment efforts to the individual citizen_ artificial intelligence can be used in the employment area to better match citizens and businesses on the basis of job ads and applications. artificial intelligence can potentially customise an optimal course for the individual citizen to get a job quickly, and better target programmes for citizens. moreover, artificial intelligence can screen for possible long-term unemployed individuals in order to offer preventive measures_ cross-authority case processing each year, the public administration processes millions of cases and it is contacted millions of times by citizens and businesses artificial intelligence can utilise data in new ways to improve the quality of citizen service centres, make problem-solving more efficient; and increasing confidence in the public administration_ among other things, the technology can automate sorting inquiries and prepare inquiries for processing: this means that case officers can concentrate on the most critical cases_ optimisation within case processing is relevant across several professional areas, including the technical and environmental area, the citizen service centres, the benefits area, the subsidies administration area, etc_ example of a signature project: cross-sector case processing artificial intelligence for better and quicker case processing in building projects artificial intelligence is likely to be used to reduce processing times when citizens or businesses need to get a building project processed. for example, in connection with screening applications, comparison with similar projects, categorisation of projects and decision support in case processing: initiative .: more investment in danish businesses the government will launch a pilot project in the form of an investment pool of dkk  million (eur .7million) over four years, and this will be targeted at enterprises with a business model based on artificial intelligence. the fund will be managed by the danish growth fund:  national strategy for artificial intelligence march 



the aim of the project is to build bridge between investors and danish businesses within artificial intelligence and thereby nurture the danish market for artificial-intelligence solutions. the danish growth fund will therefore enter into dialogue with potential private investors about co-investing in innovative businesses within artificial intelligence. there will be requirements for private co-investment from private investors in businesses funded by the danish growth fund with the investment pool, for example_ the pool can be implemented as loans or equity, depending on the specific need in the individual business_ given the requirement for private co-financing, the initiative will have a leverage effect; as private capital is also invested in the businesses. if the private level of funding is assumed to be about %, about dkk  million (about eur . million) will be invested in the development of danish businesses based on artificial intelligence_ the effect of investments will be regularly reviewed and the project will be adjusted accordingly: initiative .: exploration of the possibility of an investment agreement with the eu the danish growth fund assesses that almost % of the businesses in which the fund is currently investing have a business model based on artificial intelligence and big data. in order to promote further investments in artificial intelligence , the danish growth fund will examine the possibility of establishing an investment agreement with the upcoming eu artificial intelligence foundation in areas that are a natural extension of current investments by the danish growth fund_ the investment agreement will potentially be able to help businesses and entrepreneurs in denmark to easier access to funding more risk capital from the eu: initiative .: increased knowledge-sharing across public authorities the national centre for public sector innovation (col) will support more effective deployment and use of new technologies, including artificial intelligence, across the public sector: this is done by disseminating experience from research and specific testing and deployment projects: col will also help strengthen public-private collaboration, so that the public sector incorporates private sector competences, resources and experience to a greater extent when developing services_ national strategy for artificial intelligence march   gain



initiative .: denmark as an attractive growth environment under the strategy for denmark's digital growth, the government has allocated dkk  million (eur  million) for the digital hub denmark initiative, which, among other things, is to market and strengthen denmark's position as an attractive growth environment for artificial intelligence. in this connection, initiatives will be launched to promote danish solutions for global tech events and trade missions, to present danish solutions, to initiate a digital campaign on responsible use of artificial intelligence in denmark; etc. at the same time, digital hub denmark will help increase focus on attracting foreign investment in the digital area_ in  digital hub denmark will also spend up to dkk  million (eur ,) to develop public-private collaboration models to, among other things, improve the possibilities for life- science businesses to use, for example artificial intelligence in connection with research into health data_  national strategy for artificial intelligence march 











priority areas to lift the work of artificial intelligence in denmark goals are set out within priority areas. artificial intelligence is developing rapidly, and the possibilities are increasing across sectors, industries and functions_ artificial intelligence affect all of society. however, in some areas, denmark has particularly preconditions for artificial intelligence, for example good data: the government has therefore selected four areas where special measures will be implemented for work on artificial intelligence_ these areas are healthcare, energy and utilities, agriculture and transport the areas have been selected as the preconditions for artificial intelligence are good, for example both businesses and authorities have access to high-quality data. similarly , the eu points to the same areas as important in realising the potential of artificial intelligence in europe on this basis, the government will formulate objectives for how these areas can exploit the opportunities within artificial intelligence to strengthen denmark's position internationally. the objectives will be formulated by the responsible ministries and involving relevant stakeholders: the work will be coordinated across ministries and with initiatives that have already been launched  the objectives will take their outset in the areas' own ambitions and experience with digitisation and work on artificial intelligence. the government wants to follow-up artificial intelligence work in the sectors. as part of the ongoing work on the national strategy for artificial intelligence, the objectives will therefore be followed up to ensure that denmark reaches the full potential in the areas_ the government will ensure that the strategic sectors have access to expertise and consultancy in connection with preparation and coordination of action plans_ national strategy for artificial intelligence march  will good using using



priority areas healthcare artificial intelligence in healthcare can help physicians to diagnose diseases quicker, prioritise patients with the most acute needs and contribute to better capacity utilisation at hospitals. similarly, there is potential in supporting more targeted efforts in the local healthcare system energy and utilities businesses within green energy technology and environmental technology can use artificial intelligence to develop new products, services and business models. the products can help other businesses as well as consumers to optimise their energy consumption and thereby reduce their costs and carbon footprint: agriculture artificial intelligence can be used to support the development of precision agriculture in order to continue sustainable agriculture in denmark. by combining data from fields and weather data, artificial intelligence can predict which fields need water and fertiliser , and make adjustments accordingly: this will benefit the environment as well as agriculture. transport in the transport area, artificial intelligence can be used in self-driving cars and to ensure better and more timely public transport: furthermore, new solutions can be developed to optimise traffic management to benefit users of both public and private transport . healthcare the healthcare sector is an area in which expertise and technology are developing, and changing the way in which we provide services_ the healthcare system has regularly transformed technological advances into new opportunities within diagnostics and treatment: this provides better results for patients_ artificial intelligence is a logical step in this development: the technology can contribute to creating a more effective healthcare system offering treatment based on the needs of the individual patient: smart solutions can contribute to improved quality and coherence in patient treatment and also help healthcare staff in their tasks. a modern and effective healthcare system should therefore take position on how staff can use artificial intelligence as a tool to add value for patients and relatives_  national strategy for artificial intelligence march 



the healthcare system is currently facing a number of challenges: a population where the percentage of elderly is increasing, chronic diseases are becoming more challenging, and hospitals are having to provide targeted diagnoses as well as high-quality treatment: to deal with these challenges, the healthcare sector needs to collaborate closer with the primary healthcare sector and municipal care. at the same time, there are increasing expectations concerning treatment and procurement of new medicine, and there is a growing need to monitor side effects and the effects of pharmaceuticals. this stresses the importance of continuous innovative thinking: new, more accurate and effective tools must be found to carry out the tasks and deal with the challenges that the healthcare system is currently facing and will continue to face in the years to come_ the government has already set a direction for the healthcare system of the future with the digital health strategy - and with the health data initiative health in the future, where utilisation of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, is a common theme_ in addition, with world-class digital services, the government has allocated funds to deploy and test new technologies in the health area, for example_ for patients, artificial intelligence will lead to better, quicker and more customised diagnosis and treatment: the technology can also help earlier prediction and prevention of diseases_ for hospitals, artificial intelligence means that new opportunities arise for managing the logistics behind patient treatment more efficiently and accurately: this ultimately benefit patients and healthcare professionals as it frees resources for patient contact. for physicians in primary healthcare and at hospitals artificial intelligence can help them make the right decisions this again means better opportunities for quick and accurate diagnosis and better opportunities to focus on patients who require special attention. national strategy for artificial intelligence march   will



project with artificial intelligence in healthcare identification of heart failure together with corti; the emergency medical services at the capital region of denmark have developed a solution which, by listening in when a citizen calls the emergency number, can help healthcare staff identify symptoms of heart failure which would not otherwise be detected over the phone. in these situations, the healthcare staff will receive recommendations or alarms on their screen to help them react quicker and correctly in the situation. in % of cases, the solution can identify situations of heart failure. this is quicker and more precise than the healthcare staff; who could only identify % of the heart failures correctly: artificial intelligence helps analyse cat and mri scans one in six danes will suffer a coronary thrombosis or brain haemorrhage, and this figure will increase as the population gets older: aarhus university has developed a solution which saves time by using artificial intelligence to 'read' cat or mri images and to identify how much brain tissue can be saved for a given patient; and how much has already been permanently injured. the technology also enables smaller hospitals to offer state-of-the-art treatment: this will shorten transport time, thereby increasing the possibilities of minimising brain injury for many patients _ in this development; it is vital that we do not jeopardise the confidence of citizens and healthcare staff. responsible development and use of artificial intelligence is a mandatory principle, particularly for patient treatment by the healthcare sector. therefore , citizens, patient associations and danish businesses should help set the course in close collaboration with the health authorities. clearly , these developments must also be within the legislative framework set by the danish parliament (the folketing) regarding balanced and responsible use of health data: in order to ensure cohesive efforts, the government will coordinate efforts and signature projects in the healthcare area, including funding from investment fund denmark, with the parties within the framework of a more long-term plan for utilisation of new technology and innovation in the healthcare area  national strategy for artificial intelligence march 



. energy and utilities denmark is at the forefront with regard to ensuring sustainability, green development and sustainable energy. this benefits the environment and is a competitive advantage for danish businesses in a time when green technology is in great demand throughout the world. artificial intelligence can help maintain our leading position and strengthen the green transition, for example by ensuring better coordination of production and transport; so that only the energy required is produced. this requires a more flexible and integrated supply system than today, and that we start using artificial intelligence to a greater extent: the potentials are huge for data and the increasing digital transformation of the energy and utilities sector: therefore, with the energy agreement; the government has launched initiatives to ensure continued green transition in the energy and utilities sector, for example energy- efficient buildings. data and use of artificial intelligence are in achieving this goal. the action plan for smart energy will examine how smart solutions can couple energy consumption closer to energy production: the government will also establish regulatory free zones that will make it easier to test smart energy solutions_ the initiatives have added direction and focus to the area: however, it is important to maintain this focus if denmark is to remain at the forefront: several countries are currently investing and artificial intelligence to support their green transition. project with artificial intelligence within energy and utilities better maintenance of electricity stations energinet has installed a number of sensors at selected electricity stations throughout denmark: artificial intelligence can be used to develop solutions that can recognise patterns, for example in sounds, vibrations or temperatures at the installation. the data collected can then predict when something at the station deviates from the norm and should be maintained or replaced. this releases resources and provides better and more effective monitoring for electricity stations_ more flexible and secure electricity supply danish electricity consumption fluctuates depending on time of year and time of by analysing consumption patterns, utility companies can adjust production according to demand, thereby saving resources. in the uk, the uk national grid and deepmind have developed a solution which can reduce energy consumption by up to %. national strategy for artificial intelligence march   key very using day:



an important precondition for increasing the use of artificial intelligence in the energy and utilities sector is access to data. for example, consumption data from electricity and water meters and from sensors in pipes, pumping systems and thermostats makes it possible to develop solutions which can optimise production and supply according to demand. release of consumption data in the utilities sector is one of the recommendations that has just been made by the growth team for green energy and environmental technology. in the energy agreement; the government has set up a secretariat for digitised public-sector services in the utilities sector; which, among other things, is to look at how utilities data can be made more accessible_ in addition to contributing to the green transition, better geodata can also help the business community to develop new and innovative solutions. for instance, data can help telecommunications operators when new underground cables are to be laid, or the insurance sector where up-to-date data is necessary to calculate fair insurance premiums in the event of flooding and storm damage in order to create conditions for efficiency improvements and growth opportunities in the business community, it is vital that geodata, including maps is up-to-date today, mapping is carried out aerial photographs, and the photos are then partly processed manually. this is expensive, and it takes a long time. production time is particularly determined by how long data processing takes: the government will therefore launch a new project entitled automatic photo recognition geodanmark"" to provide access to better and up-to-date map data: a pilot project will be carried out on automatic identification of changes to buildings artificial intelligence_ this will make it easier to access map data and develop new solutions, for example to plan routes_ up-to-date map data also help in the public sector. it will make it easier for municipalities to prepare local development plans and follow up on flooding: in the long term, the ambition is to automate the entire process of mapping denmark, and the possibility to make the underlying algorithms available to the business community will be examined: . agriculture the agricultural sector has been a cornerstone of danish society for centuries. danish farms are some of the most efficient in the world. this is because the sector has kept up with the times and has continuously embraced new technologies_ this is competitive advantage that denmark must maintain by continuing to develop its agricultural sector with new technology. more use of new solutions that can increase efficiency in danish agriculture is necessary_ the agricultural sector is currently not only under pressure financially, but also in terms of access to qualified labour: climate change demands new forms of production and efficient  national strategy for artificial intelligence march  good good good using using will



exploitation of manure and pesticides. finally, agricultural land is increasingly overloaded and it is being degraded by heavy machinery. in agriculture, artificial intelligence enables farmers to spray exactly where weeds are growing and fertilise exactly where the yield can be increased, whilst protecting the areas with the highest runoff risks. better use of resources will save the individual farmer money and benefit the environment. in this way, using new technology can support the development of precision agriculture, so that sustainable agriculture can continue in denmark: developing the agricultural sector will be on the industry's own terms and initiative. however, the government will provide the required framework in order to seize the opportunities for growth and improved competitiveness brought by artificial intelligence_ in partnership with the agricultural sector, the government has initiated a number of pilot projects. one project is examining how the amount of manure can be varied according to the needs of crops. this is possible by using data collected from sensors in the soil. irrigation is another area in which smart solutions can contribute to more intelligent and sustainable development: there is no reason to irrigate more than necessary, and field irrigation of sandy soils in correct doses can increase yields by up to %. the government will also initiate a new ""intelligent irrigation"" pilot project artificial intelligence to develop a solution for intelligent crop irrigation. system will be developed to predict irrigation needs and manage field irrigation. by creating new algorithms and combining weather data from weather stations and field data, the project will develop a system to predict which fields need irrigation and register where, when and how much has been irrigated: the possibility to adjust the level of irrigation to the actual needs for individual fields will benefit everyone. it will protect the environment; make work easier for farmers and enhance the competitiveness of danish agriculture. national strategy for artificial intelligence march   using



project with artificial intelligence within agriculture agrointelli this year; the danish company agrointelli launched their self-driving robotti robot: the robot can be used for seedbed preparation, sowing; mechanical cleaning or to add nutrients. it navigates via gps and optimises its own route in the field using artificial intelligence the swiss ecorobotix ecorobotix makes autonomous weeding solutions by combining robots and artificial intelligence the solution can reduce pesticides use by up to %. herd navigator herd navigator is a automatic solution developed in denmark to monitor the reproduction and health of cows. the solution conducts online analysis of data from sensors and cows and this provides farmers with information about animal health, reproduction and nutrition, etc. . transport artificial intelligence has the potential to improve danes' mobility and at the same time help make transport in denmark safer, cheaper and greener. advances within artificial intelligence can improve self-driving transport, enable delivery by drones, and optimise digital mobility solutions_ common for these advances is that are largely based on effective access to, and analysis of, data_ the mobility for the future expert group () sees benefits from exploiting the capacity of the transport system through optimised traffic management and use of real-time data about traffic. the transport sector has many private and public players on the market through more extensive data exchange, new solutions and business models based on artificial intelligence are to be developed: due to the high level of digitisation, denmark is in a favourable position to utilise transport data. for example, increased exchange of data on timetables and real-time updates of operations and delays in public transport will prepare the ground for new public mobility services and business models_ at the same time, driver-assist technologies, and in the long term, driverless technologies, will be able to utilise real-time data to optimise route planning and improve safety. in september , the easier public transport policy initiative was launched. it contains a number of initiatives to promote the development of digital mobility services linking planning, payment and ticketing across private and public modes of transport.  national strategy for artificial intelligence march  fully they great likely -



for example, an initiative will be launched to ensure that transport data from public transport operators, including statistical and selected dynamic transport data, is shared and made freely available. it is also proposed that public transport operators enable resale of selected tickets through a third party, and this will support the market's possibility to develop new digital and innovative mobility solutions. project with artificial intelligence within transport fuel-efficient routes independent research fund denmark is supporting a research project on the use of artificial intelligence that can guide transport operators to choose the quickest and most fuel-efficient route using big data on how traffic is moving at different times during the in collaboration with researchers from the us and australia, researchers from aalborg university will develop algorithms that can manage systems associated with great uncertainty. independent research fund denmark has granted dkk . million (eur ,) to the project: artificial intelligence can also help prevent congestion: by analysing anonymised location data for mobile phones, it is possible to predict traffic flows and design better urban spaces and infrastructure_ the government will initiate a new ""better use of location data for mobile phones pilot project in collaboration with the telecommunications industry_ this initiative will support denmark as a data-ethical frontrunner that also develops new innovative databased technologies_ the pilot project will clarify the legal and data-ethical frameworks for displaying and location data, and it will test the commercial possibilities of using location data for artificial intelligence_ the data used in the pilot project will be aggregated and anonymised ensuring that only non-personal data are used. under the pilot project; the government will establish a closed 'sandbox' with anonymised and aggregated location data: this will provide a secure environment in which the authorities control access to data. trials aimed at businesses will be initiated as 'challenges' and 'hackathons' where selected businesses will have access to data in the closed 'sandbox' . among other things, the trials will identify aggregation levels of data that secure the anonymity of individuals, and at the same time trials will enable development of intelligent solutions to benefit citizens, businesses and authorities_ national strategy for artificial intelligence march  day: using

challenges with the implementation of artificial intelligence (ai) companies are adopting al with genuine sentiment that the technology will create panoply of transformative   opportunities to leverage the value chain process, get to market faster, service customers better, drive efficiencies and deliver competitive benefits. however, even if the technology appears business and user friendly, companies face multiple challenges in implementing al solutions below are some of the challenges that enterprises face while implementing an al solution to its business process: lack of skilled human resources al is engendering demand for new advanced skill sets in the workplace there is an extensive shortage of talent that possesses the right understanding of the current al technologies, its limitations, and applications. the lack of skilled professionals who can build, maintain these technologies and direct a company's al agenda prominently hampers progress and continues to be a major impediment for businesses around the world: businesses face a significant  capability gap in recruiting the right talents such as data   scientists, cybersecurity experts, computer scientists and it specialists to get maximum output from al. there is an unprecedented shortage of human resources with advanced skills in mathematics and sciences and a fundamental grasp of analytical and technical matters. one of the reasons for this al skills crisis is that many of our academic institutions and training programs cannot up pace with innovation and new discoveries. even if research showed that interest and investment are strong for al, companies failed to define their al strategy and invest in the appropriate training and upskilling mechanisms to foster leading al practitioners: cybersecurity and data privacy concerns the   implementation of al-based solutions by business   enterprises is   raising whole host of cybersecuricy and data classification and privacy issues and stimulating a robust debate globally: it is advanced that al applications face threats from cybersecurity attacks. this refers if the data used by al are corrupted by hackers, the outcomes could be erroneous due to bias in data and algorithms and consequently cause harm to an organization by making incorrect and perhaps wrong predictions additionally, the use of al to existing regulatory framework has become a threat it is important to recognize that data is a critical feature for aland the way that al systems learn is by using and analyzing data and make decisions without the need for human interaction: the greater the amount of data these al systems have, the better the decisions become: it is clearly visible that the use of al has implications for privacy, data protection and the rights of individuals poor data governance can result in an unintentional release of secure or privatelconfidential information where customers' personal identifiable information that feeds an algorithm may into the hands of hackers and can cause legal challenges for the organization.  mauritius artificial intelligence strategy key key keep public get



loss of jobs artificial intelligence is advanced as an integral part of the new era. there is fear and concern by employees regarding al and automation and how this technological change may lead to massive job loss_ employees are concerned that al will substitute, supplement and amplify all tasks currently performed by humans and subsequently eliminate big proportion of the world's human labor and displace between millions of jobs requiring people to switch job categories entirely. it is advanced that potential job loss on a major scale resulting from al technology will have a direct and indirect impact on the job the market: one key direct impact of al is a robot replacing employees or taking their jobs or an employee using al solutions to increase productivity or switch to new responsibility. an indirect impact is when a new firm using al or developing a substitute product grows and puts the company the employee works to close: ethicall moral challenges the application of al has raised numerous ethicall moral challenges to the society in the ways in which al systems implemented by business enterprises are making moral decisions in practical day-to-day situations in variety of industries. it is difficult for human being to teach morality or fairness to machines that make it easy for a computer to process or provide machines with clear answers and decision rules to any potential ethical dilemmas it might encounter: it is even debatable if we human have a sound understanding or precise conception of what morality or fairness is, that we can all agree on to effectively train machines to make better moral decisions. to integrate ethics into ai system could amplify structural discrimination and reproduce biases in the data are based on. there is absence of standards in place to govern what's acceptable and what's not; or to outline what company is responsible for because of al-based decisions. a clear, explicit; and transparent code of ethics about what al can and cant do needs to be established: skills development and capacity building artificial intelligence is data-driven technology that is both powering autonomous machines and augmenting the flow of information and analysis for human workers as machine learning evolves, workers must learn to adjust in much the same way as adapting to a new tool or software service: al is expected to have a significant impact on the competitiveness of both countries and companies and it has become clear that the demand for al talent will far outweigh the available supply in both short and medium terms. according to study by element al, there are only , phd-educated al researchers in the world-_40% of whom are concentrated in the us. as result; training of domestic talent is of paramount importance and countries are rushing to develop al master and phd programs, short-term training initiatives, massive open online courses, and scholarships and fellowships. almost every recent national strategy includes some combination of these initiatives to attract; retain, and develop al talent: training and talent development as determinant in the past fifteen months, canada, china, denmark, the eu commission, finland, france, india, italy, japan, mexico, the nordic-baltic region, singapore, south korea, sweden, taiwan, the uae, and the  mauritius artificial intelligence strategy beings failing they key



uk have all released strategies to promote the use and development of al. though no two strategies are alike, common aspects of al policy are scientific research, talent development; skills and education, public and private sector adoption, ethics and inclusion, standards and regulations, and data and digital infrastructure_ the availability of skilled manpower in al is a necessity and the underlying premise of all the strategies is that al will augment human employees rather than replacing them: it is thus important to ensure that employees are trained in the skills need to work with ai. undoubtedly, al specialists are one of the fastest-growing jobs in technology as advancements in al over the last decade are presenting opportunities for companies to automate business processes, transform customer experiences, and differentiate products offerings as al permeates every industry, companies either need new hires to work on the al or training to develop current employees' skills overview of various strategies adopted the shortage of al talent remains an issue and the fierce competition for talent has contributed to a large uptick in acquisitions of al companies. early al technologies and the forthcoming al revolution are forcing organizations to reevaluate a number of established strategies instead of the most qualified person for a specific task, many companies are now putting greater emphasis on cultural fit and adaptability, knowing that individual roles will have to evolve along with the implementation of ai: on-the-job training has become more vital to transition people into new roles as new technologies are adapted: the pan-canadian artificial intelligence strategy is five-ear plan to invest in al research and talent the strategy has four goals: (i) increase the number of al researchers and graduates, () establish three clusters of scientific excellence, () develop thought leadership on the economic, ethical, policy, and legal implications of al, and () support the national research community on al. canada canada's al strategy is distinct from other strategies because it is primarily a research and talent strategy: the new al institutes such as cifar chairs in al, and the national al program are all geared towards enhancing canada's international profile as a leader in al research and training: china the plan lays out the government's intention to recruit the world's best al talent; strengthen the training of the domestic al labour force the strategy has three goals: (i) make danish businesses the best at using digital technologies; () have the best conditions in place for the digital transformation of denmark business; and () ensure every dane is equipped with the necessary digital skills to compete_ the technology pact ( nationwide initiative to foster digital skills) has also been developed: initiative included the creation of the finnish centre for al joint partnership by aalto and helsinki universities to increase al research, talent; and finland industry collaboration), an al accelerator pilot program, and the integration of al in the public service germany already has number of related policies in place to develop ai. principally, the government; in partnership with academia and industry actors, germany focuses on integrating al technologies into germany's export sectors the flagship program has been industry ., but recently the strategic has shifted to smart services, which relies more on al technologies table : training and skills  mauritius artificial intelligence strategy they hiring key goal



mauritius and al the / budget set the foundations for the emergence of a thriving ecosystem for al under the theme ""harnessing artificial intelligence to foster innovative entrepreneurship' starting with the setting up of a mauritius artificial intelligence council (maic) comprising members from the and private sectors, as well as international experts to spearhead and drive al related activities and advise government on the way forward. this initiative builds on a series of actions taken by the government of mauritius to facilitate innovative firms to set up in mauritius and foster a domestic entrepreneurial spirit in fields such as al, lot, blockchain and fintech: some of these include: the regulatory sandbox license around the world, there has been numerous sandbox   licensing mechanisms that have mushroomed; with the pioneer being the financial conduct authority in uk the mauritian regulatory sandbox license is more flexible in scope, and allows activities in areas where there are no or no adequate provisions in the existing regulatory framework the edb is responsible to manage the sandbox, and works in close collaboration with regulators to provide the adequate framework these activities: b. innovator's occupation permit the minimum investment to qualify for an occupation permit; which is a combined work and live permit for foreigners willing to do business in mauritius, is usd /,. however, entrepreneurs with new and creative ideas who want to set up business in mauritius, especially may not be eligible for an occupation permit since the initial investment requirement for such projects is less than usd |,. in fact, such entrepreneurs are mainly based in home offices, but will be involved in the development of innovative products in areas of technology, digital economy and biotech research which will spur productivity and economic competitiveness. an innovator op was launched to allow these innovative businesses to work in mauritius, with an initial investment of only usd ,, subject to meeting a % percent requirement in terms of randd expenditure fiscal incentives company set up on or after july  and involved in innovation-driven activities for intellectual property assets which are developed in mauritius can benefit from an exemption of  income years as from the income year in which the company started its innovation-driven activities. the government also allows double  deduction of qualifying  expenditure incurred for randd purposes: ""qualifying expenditure"" includes, inter alia, staff costs, consumable items, computer software directly used in research and development and subcontracted research and development: in addition, there are a series of grants and schemes that favour the development of innovative projects. the mauritius research council offers seven innovation and commercialisation schemes as follows:  mauritius artificial intelligence strategy public for they



collaborative research and innovation grant scheme (crigs) it allows local companies or a consortium ranging from micro, small and medium enterprises, to large companies to submit proposals for innovative, collaborative research and development projects with commercial potential, in partnership with local academic research tertiary education institution(s), awarding matching grant of up to rssm per project to successful applicants for a project duration of normally up to  months b intellectual property promotion scheme (ipps) the purpose of this scheme is to encourage individuals, enterprises, industry and randd institutions to take advantage of the mechanisms for protecting innovation currently offered by the industrial property system in mauritius. the ipps, which operates as joint collaboration between the mauritius research council (mrc) and the industrial property office (ipo) aims to boost creativity and innovation, initially through support towards applications made for the grant of patents and registration of industrial designs social innovation research grant scheme (sirgs) it is an innovative scheme to tackle an existing gap in social innovation in the local context: social innovation refers to the adoption of new social practices in order to meet social needs in a different or more effective way. ngos andlor funded bodies in collaboration with academiclresearch institutions/private sector companies can submit proposals which combine action-research and a social innovation potential with tangible outcomes in social development research areas including but not limited to social integration of vulnerable groups, equal opportunities and environmental issues a grant of up to rsim per project may be awarded for a project duration not exceeding  months d_ national sme incubator scheme (nsis) the main aim of the nsis is to encourage the creation of innovative businesses for the socio- economic benefit of the republic of mauritius through nurturing and training process in conducive environment provided by accredited incubators driven by the private sector: the accredited incubators which will select; coach and mentor innovative business start-ups as early as the idea stage: the nsis will fund (on a . matching basis) accredited private sector incubators at different incubation phases through accredited incubators funded by the nsis. these phases are as follows: pre incubation phase, incubation phase and acceleration phase proof of concept scheme (pcs) it allows enterprises, entrepreneurs, researchers, as well as institutions, to submit applications under the proof of concept scheme (pcs) in line with prioricy areas (renewable ocean technology, ocean resources and ocean services; ictibpo/telecommunications; life sciences; manufacturing; traffic management; social issues; and agro-industry). funding of up to muri million per project may be available, for a project duration not exceeding i2 months  mauritius artificial intelligence strategy public grant energy;

embrace such sectors like domotics, robotics, etc have been slow. on the other hand, adoption of blockchain backed technologies and other fintech related applications are seeing significant reluctances: finally, knowledge-based industry clearly requires the protection of intellectual property which is the key denominator in guarantying long-term revenues from actual research and development projects d declining and ageing population as mauritius aspires to graduate to a high-income economy, it is imperative to address structural challenges such as lack of adequate skills to develop new sectors, looming economic bane of a rapidly ageing population, and cumbersome administrative processes to allocate permits for both high skilled and low skilled workers: without a new strategy, there will be a worsening of the dependency ratio. indeed,  working persons are contributing for  non-workers by , the latter figure will rise to /., which could impose severe pressure to increase taxes the proportion of elderly (+) will increase from around io% of the population today to ./%, while the working age population will gradually fall to . % from  % today according to un population prospects . it, thus, becomes imperative for the mauritius to embrace new technologies that will resolve the skill mismatch issue and build resilience to reduce the dependency ratio or render the latter more sustainable. social issues there are number of social issues plaguing mauritius, such as abuse, congestion, law and order and road accidents global warming and erratic weather conditions cause much ground for concern as well it is therefore important that due consideration is given to means to address these issues more efficiently through technology: adoption of al in mauritius al and other emerging technologies can address, at least partly, some of these issues. this report aims at providing a roadmap defining the considerations for the development of the right ecosystem to enable mauritius to adopt new technologies as enablers of growth for the next decade: the main focus areas of the strategies include: (i) prioritization of sectors and identification of national projects (ii) skills attraction and capacity building incentives to catalyse implementation ethical considerations of al  development of strategic alliances in emerging technologies sensitization campaigns (vii) adoption of new technologies for improved services delivery  mauritius artificial intelligence strategy today, drug key public

manufacturing the world is moving toward industry . or the fourth industrial revolution very fast; where artificial intelligence (al) and machine-learning (ml) based systems are not only changing the ways we interact with information and computers but also revolutionising the manufacturing sector: the manufacturing industry has recently witnessed surge in the application and implantation of artificial intelligence as the technology has matured accompanied by in costs. al developers have also come up with new application possibilities and algorithms allowing more complex decisions: major companies including ge, siemens, intel, funac, kuka, bosch, nvidia and microsoft are all making significant investments in machine learning-powered approaches to improve all aspects of manufacturing: the technology is used to bring down labour costs, reduce product defects, shorten unplanned downtimes, improve transition times and increase production speed. smart manufacturing supported by industrial lot and al is projected to grow noticeably in the next  to  years, according to market intelligence provider trendforce. the firm estimates that the global smart manufacturing market will be well over s200 billion in  and will increase to over  billion by . that is projected compound annual growth rate of . percent: similarly, the international federation of robotics estimated that by  the number of operational industrial robots installed in factories will grow to . million from just i. million in . the manufacturing business requires high initial investments with relatively low returns as such, traditionally, manufacturing companies have been driven to operate in low-wages countries where investment in al would have seemed unreasonable however, with the globalisation trend, the movement towards high income has become inevitable and manufacturers located in the emerging markets do not have any other than to invest in al to down production costs and stay competitive. in , the following applications of al have been identified in the manufacturing sector: process and operations optimization root cause analysis based on machine learning non-destructive testing asset management; supply chain management, and inventory management adoption of machine learning and analytics to improve predictive maintenance generate a / % reduction in annual maintenance costs, up to % downtime reduction and % reduction in inspection costs machine learning for supply chain forecasting- expected to reduce forecasting errors by % and consequently reduce costs related to transport and warehousing and supply chain administration by  to /% and  to %, respectively al and machine-learning   algorithms into procurement; strategic   sourcing and cost management the manufacturing sector in mauritius the manufacturing industry remains one of the main pillars of the mauritian economy and contributed .% to gdp in . the breakdown in terms of sub sector contribution is: food (excl  sugar) %, textile %, sugar % and other manufacturing activities %. its contribution to gdp has however been gradually  declining from peak of .% in  to .% in december . in terms of employment; the manufacturing industry employed , people in , representing around % of total employment: figure below shows the manufacturing sector contribution to gdp (%) over the last  years.  mauritius artificial intelligence strategy drop being option bring



. . . .      figure  manufacturing sector contribution to the gdp statistics  clearly demonstrate decrease in the contribution of the manufacturing sector in the economy and this is evidence for the loss of interest of promoters in the sector. several manufacturing companies have closed down to relocalise elsewhere due to the increasing production costs in mauritius. this would be about the right time for companies to invest in al to leverage on the available applications to bring down production costs and remain competitive. the main labour intensive components of the mauritian manufacturing sector are the sugar, textiles and clothing; food and beverages and precision engineering companies, inter alia. with the rise in labour cost; the ageing population and the fad for the new generation to work in the services and finance sectors, the manufacturing industry can only survive if automation and al is taken on board so as to sustain the profitability of the sector. it has indeed been observed that the major operators in the manufacturing sector, in an effort to remain sustainable; have started investing in the  implementation towards   industry .. most machineries and equipment installed over the last decade, irrespective of the sector of activity or product; have the basic platform for the eventual implementation of automation and al. actually, there are many companies who have already implemented components of al, at various degrees, and using al at some in the value chain would not require huge investments benefits of using al in manufacturing by implementing the right al technology, a company can: save time and money by automating routine processes and tasks increase productivity and operational efficiencies make faster business decisions based on outputs from cognitive technologies avoid mistakes and 'human error', provided that smart systems are set up properly use insight to predict customer preferences and offer them better,  personalised experience mine vast amount of data to generate quality leads and grow the customer base achieve cost savings, by optimising resources and products increase revenue by identifying and maximising sales opportunities grow expertise by enabling analysis and offering intelligent advice and support having the right al applications allow manufacturers to make more informed decisions at each stage in the production process in real time:  mauritius artificial intelligence strategy point key



in the case of production, with the use of sensors, al spot defects in real time on the production line and immediate action is taken to remove defects as well as to the appropriate adjustments to prevent the defects to repeat with real-time problem-solving manufacturers can achieve potential cost savings defects, repairs and down time: textiles the textile sector has been an important pillar of the mauritian economy for more than decades before knowing a drastic decline over the last  years due to fierce competition: in , the textile industry contributed to . % to the economy and was employing , persons with [ companies. costs of operation have increased and there is an acute need for process optimization and optimised resources utilization for the industry to survive; which can now be achieved by many al applications developed for the purpose. for example, in garment manufacturing fabric yield is of great importance as fabric represents up to % of the total garment cost: thus, optimising the cutting department is critical and one big textile factory has totally automated its cutting department and is controlled by al. the machine is connected and is always benchmarking with data available online to ensure that the optimum is obtained at all moment and for all products. similarly, another factory producing denim, uses al for real time defect detection during production and automatically perform required  machine adjustments, so as to prevent or minimize waste generation: other fields of the textile industry where al applications can be used to improve efficiency and augment the capabilities of their human employees are: detecting and eliminating yarn imperfections during spinning fabric pattern recognition in weaving and knitting mills inspection of printing quality intelligent colour matching based on historic and current data fabric finishing parameters currently applications are being developed where machine learning will potentially enable business to find patterns and correlations between fibre properties, process parameters, yarn properties, machine settings, and fabric performance: this might help textile businesses to discover interrelationships that were previously undiscovered thus in improving efficiency and maintenance: this   includes providing integrated processes in production, quality, cost; information, statistical process control; just-in-time manufacturing and computer-integrated manufacturing: expert systems and artificial neural networks are currently being introduced in modern textile industries sewbots, designed to revolutionise the textile industry in the near future the sewbot; currently being developed by softwear automation in america is an automatic sewing robot which uses a highly calibrated machine vision to watch and analyze fabric: it detects distortions and robotically adjusts the fabric. working across -foot long t-shirt production line, the robot performs each task; including cutting sewing a seam, adding a sleeve, and quality inspection: each of the way, the computer vision guides the fabric it starts with the programming, so that when the designer designs the in 2d or 3d, the sew data is embedded in the file that goes right to the robot: the sewbot currently has limited capabilities but is expected to revolutionise the textile industry in the near future  mauritius artificial intelligence strategy bring yield aiding step good



food and beverages industry the food and beverages industry is growing one in mauritius and comprise around  large establishments, employing up to , people: the competition is tough, particularly with regards to imports from malaysia, china, south africa and many other countries consumers are constantly demanding more for less and the industry needs to look for new ways to satisfy customers while keeping costs low. nowadays this is better done by al applications than the human counterpart: integrating al into the food business can dramatically reduce human errors and hike up quality, leading to an increase in consumer satisfaction and, eventually, sales: there are number of al applications which have already been implemented in the fandb processing industry  in number of international company and mauritius   should follow to be able to stay competitive. it should be however noted that most fandb companies in mauritius are automated to various degrees and the leap to al implementation should not incur very high investments. some of the al applications that would be useful to the mauritian fandb industry are: sorting food it can be time-consuming to sort fresh produce in order to prepare them for the manufacturing of canned and bagged goods. for example, sorting the size of potatoes can help manufacturers make decisions regarding which ones should be made into french fries, potato chips or hash browns. the system uses sensor-based optical sorting solutions with machine learning functionalities it utilises cameras and near-infrared sensors to view food in the same way that consumers do and sorts it based on this data, saving time and money and improving the quality of products improving the supply chain al helps in supply chain management as food safety regulations have become stricter and companies need to be more transparent about their operations. the technology helps companies test and monitor food safety products at every step of the supply chain. it helps in creating more accurate forecasts to help manage pricing and inventory, while it also tracks products from farm to consumer to offer transparency: ensuring personal hygiene al is also helping to improve personal hygiene in a food plant, which is just as important as hygiene in kitchen and helps to ensure that a facility is compliant with regulations. the system, which can also be used in restaurants; uses cameras to monitor workers and it uses facial-recognition and object- recognition software to determine if workers are wearing hats and masks as required by food safety laws if it discovers a violation, the software extracts the screen images for review, and the technology is reportedly accurate more than % of the time. cleaning processing equipment another important element of maintaining health standards is with advanced processes that help to clean equipment university of nottingham researchers are developing a system that uses al to reduce cleaning time and resources by % to %. it's called self-optimising-clean-in-place, or socip, and it uses ultrasonic sensing and optical fluorescence imaging to measure food residue; as well as microbial debris in a piece of equipment; followed by optimising the cleaning process.  mauritius artificial intelligence strategy quite



al and predictive maintenance maintenance is key area that can drive major cost savings and production value around the world: the cost of machine downtime is high: according to the international society of automation, $ billion is lost globally each year. over the years, businesses have overhauled maintenance processes to alleviate downtime and improve effectiveness but the best way to use data in the quest for optimum operational efficiency had been missing: with al and machine learning; it is now possible to process massive amounts of sensor data faster than ever before. this   gives   companies an unprecedented chance to improve upon   existing maintenance operations and even add something new: predictive maintenance. one industry that can expect to see unprecedented savings from al is manufacturing: while most manufacturers are already using some form of preventive or predictive maintenance, al can usher in a new era of productivity: ai predictive maintenance uses data from various sources like historical maintenance records, sensor data from machines, and weather data to determine when machine will need to be serviced: leveraging real-time asset data plus historical data, operators can make more informed decisions about when a machine will need a repair. predictive maintenance tools upgrade the existing maintenance systems by using al to ensure that people have the right knowledge and tools to keep mission-critical assets running at peak performance altogether, predictive maintenance allows for an optimised maintenance frequency and machine parts utilisation, leading to huge cost savings for example, in machineries, the shafts and ball bearings of rollers are constantly under pressure and to prevent unplanned downtimes, are changed at some predefined frequency as part of preventive maintenance. with the implementation of al, it is now possible to use data from sensors measuring parameters such as temperature, vibration, friction so as to predict the exact time for replacement this prevents undue replacements resulting into cost case study of al and manufacturing- general electric general electric is the  ist largest company in the world by revenue and one of the largest and most diverse manufacturers on the planet, making everything from large industrial equipment to home appliances. lt has over  factories around the world and has only begun transforming them into smart facilities in  ge launched its brilliant manufacturing suite for customers, which it had been field testing in its own factories. the system takes a holistic approach of tracking and processing everything in the manufacturing process to find possible issues before emerge and to detect inefficiencies their first brilliant factory' was built that year in pune, india with a $ million investment: ge claims it improved equipment effectiveness at this facility by  percent: the of ges brilliant manufacturing suite is to link design, engineering manufacturing; supply chain, distribution and services into one globally scalable, intelligent system: it is powered by predix, their industrial internet of things   platform: in the   manufacturing space, predix can use sensors to automatically capture every step of the process and monitor each piece of complex equipment: with that data, the predix deep learning capabilities can spot potential problems and possible solutions ge spent around $ / billion developing the system, and by  ge expects predix to process one million terabytes of data per day:  mauritius artificial intelligence strategy heavy heavy savings. they goal



genow has seven brilliant factories, powered by their predix system, that serve as test cases. it claims positive improvements at each: for example, according to ge their system results in, their wind generator factory in vietnam   increasing productivity by  percent and its jet engine factory in muskegon had  percent better on-time delivery rate. claim it has also cut unplanned downtime by - percent by equipping machines with smart sensors to detect wear. challenges implementation of al in manufacturing organisations have the following basic technologies, which can be quite costly: smart factory will need to be networked, taking data from production lines, design and engineering teams, and quality control to form an integrated, intelligent operation. if manufacturers don't have the right smart machines and the right data collection points, it's just data with little or no insight; and insight is what creates world class optimised operations: need for new skills to be able to manage and sustain the al technology succeeding in al implementation gartner, the world's leading research and advisory company gives below advices for companies to smoothly implement al in their businesses: begin by aiming low with al projects given that al is relatively new concept and organisations still have and learning curve ahead of them and need to better understand artificial intelligence applications in their line of business, it is advised that a company aims low first until it fully understands and masters the implications of al: focus on augmenting people the replacement of people by artificial intelligence and related technologies such as robotics has been cause of concern since while organisations always aim for less overhead and maximum cost savings, the focus should be more on how to utilise artificial intelligence to augment worker's capabilities, rather than to replace the worker: this helps to avoid resistance and also align with what al really is, that is a decision-enabler. plan for knowledge transfer al management skills are scarce. as such it is essential to make sure that during al projects there is proper knowledge transfer from the supplier to the organisation: on top of being able to understand, manage and exploit data, it is to make sure the right data are fed to the al engine in order to get the right outcomes  this is and needs to be understood in the organisation as part of that knowledge transfer. gartner predicts ""that through ,  percent of al projects will deliver erroneous outcomes due to bias in data, algorithms or the teams responsible for managing them' select the proper al solutions in the initial stages gartner advises to choose transparent al solutions in initial stages so as to have an insight into how the al engine comes to specific decisions so as to build up the confidence in using al. conclusion automation, robotics, and complex analytics have all been used by the manufacturing industry for years: for decades entire businesses and academic   fields have existed for  looking at data in manufacturing to find ways to reduce waste and improve efficiency. manufacturing is already reasonably streamlined and technically advanced field.  mauritius artificial intelligence strategy they key using long: key key



as a result; the utilisation of more advanced al is less likely to cause massive disruption but will look like evolution rather than a revolution: greater industrial connectivity, more widely deployed sensors, more powerful analytics, and improved robots are all able to squeeze out noticeable but modest improvements in efficiency or flexibility: applications of al in manufacturing boil down to: computer vision- for microscopic vision generative design- generates optimal design as per input parameters and leverages on machine learning digital twins- virtual model of a process, product or service for out of site optimisation predictive maintenance- use of sensors and advanced analytics for machines to report their conditions in real time the newer applications of machine learning produce relatively  modest  reductions in  equipment failures, better on-time deliveries, slight improvements in equipment; and faster training times in the competitive world of industrial robotics. though these improvements may seem small, when added together the total potential is significant: according to the un, worldwide value added by manufacturing was $. trillion in / and this is why companies are spending billions on developing al tools to squeeze a few extra percentage saving out of different processes currently, mass production is the dominant model in manufacturing since tailor made is too expensive due to high costs involved in redesigning of production lines for new products   though customers would prefer customised products, abide by the mass production concept due to the parameter: it al and machine learning achieve and making manufacturing processes flexible allowing cheap customization, that would create a real shift in several markets. for example, instead of most shoes coming in a dozen sizes, might be made in an infinite number of sizes, each order custom- fitted, built, and shipped within hours of the order placed.  mauritius artificial intelligence strategy saving they price they being

agriculture rationale for al agriculture is seeing rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (al) and machine learning (ml) both in terms of agricultural products and in-field farming techniques. the application of artificial intelligence (al) to the problems of agriculture will be critical in the near future the most challenging problem facing agriculture; in general, is the shrinking labour force combined with expanding production and distribution requirements needed to feed the planet and grow local economies the population of farmers is shrinking: fewer young people are choosing to plant and grow crops in the traditional manner. this poses a threat to the mauritian economy: the most sustainable solution to the challenges of a shrinking labour force and need for continued production growth is automation at various stages of production: in addition to automation in general, there is a move to use different sensors together with al decision-making to make automation smart' this can be accomplished by al systems capable of making human-like decisions that may ultimately limit the use of harmful chemical pesticideslherbicides and diagnose and treat plants and animals individually: because most of the required sensors are inexpensive and computer power is affordable it is possible to use them together with al to more efficiently fertilize, irrigate, diagnose and treat crops and animals on case-by-case basis: tracking individual organisms provides the capability of early detection of health problems that may threaten yields al systems are capable of using neural networks to classify inputs and give high quality outputs leading to predictions that allow farmers and scientists to generate models that forecast yields or optimize efficiency of production: major al techniques in agriculture: expert systems, artificial neural networks and fuzzy systems, hybrid systems such as neuro-fuzzy or image processing coupled with artificial neural networks al applications: crop management; crop protection systems pest management: systems that identify active pests and suggest control measures disease management weed management: minimize herbicide application yield prediction: various machine learning analytical models help farmers to predict the impact of various environment factors on crop   yield: farmers can forecast weather conditions and accordingly take corrective measures_ potential applications of al in the mauritian context precision farming_ ""right place, right time;, right product"" al provides a more accurate and controlled technique that replaces the repetitive and labour-intensive part of farming: it also provides guidance about crop rotation, optimum planting and harvesting time, water  management, nutrient management and pest attacks. precision farming helps in increasing profitability by identifying crops and market strategically. it enables overall accuracy and efficient use of resources through precision farming management identification of stress level in plant can be obtained from high-resolution images and multiple sensor data on plants.  mauritius artificial intelligence strategy

classify pests, birds; bats and predators auditory monitoring of crops to detect and classify pests, birds, bats and predators that may be operating at night:  the al system functions to identify specific types of sounds associated with specific organisms and their known behaviors companies involved in al for agricultural applications intello labs (india) use deep learning algorithms for image analysis. using this technology, farmers can check health of their crop at different stage of its growth: for instance, their mobile phone app, the tomato farmer could take picture of a bushel of tomatoes and upload it into intello's system. the company's algorithms would examine the photo of the tomatoes and gives it a rating based on a set of government (i.e. usda) or other criteria. with this objective, algorithmic rating in place, each party in the negotiation now knows the quality of the tomatoes being sold, thus providing quality grading to different food products peat (berlin based agricultural startup) developed plantix, an application based on learning algorithm to identify defects in crops and soil health: microsoft in collaboration with united phosphorous developed pest risk protection to help farmers with advance information about pest attacks. microsoft has developed an al based sowing app that forecast the right time to sow crops as per the climatic conditions. farmers using this app get text or voice message to the farmers about the right time for sowing of crops: to overcome herbicide resistance, blue river technology developed an agricultural robot to ensure weed control and protect crops a robot called see and spray using automation and computer vision spray weeds on cotton precisely and prevent herbicide resistance: cropln and robert bosch engineering and business solutions provide a range of technologies based on alin areas such as pest   surveillance,  climate control; controlled irrigation and warehouse management forward the first necessary stage to implement any of the above concrete examples of al in agriculture is gathering sensor data in an efficient and inexpensive automated manner that can provide sensitive imaging; sound, chemical and biological information to train the al system. not only will al assist with automation to help solve the problem of a shrinking labor force but it will also help mitigate problems associated with climate change, such as drought and disease and anthropogenic pollution or other environmental assaults. the   promotion of  precision   agriculture, smart irrigation, remote sensing   technology, drone applications and cold storage solutions that rely on al and lot accessible both through web and mobile applications should boost tremendously the agricultural sector in mauritius. overall, the emerging field of alhas the benefit of engaging young entrepreneurs to help solve the growing problems in agriculture for mauritius: the uom is developing an agri-tech park and one of its identified thrust is digital farming: the university proposes to spearhead the proposed applications of al in agriculture in close collaboration  [ mauritius artificial intelligence strategy using  deep guide way



with all stakeholders from the and parastatals organisations and private companies through a digital farming cluster: two concrete proposals for al applications are: proposal #i: fruit bat monitoring and damage incidence on our local fruits auditory monitoring of birds, bats and other predators can be effected by making use of drone technology: more so, infrared cameras can supplement the auditory monitoring of pest noise and confirm fruit bat population in major production areas of the island. an al system can be developed to capture the data from the sensors, cameras and auditory devices to understand behaviors of pest organisms. specific cypes of sounds and their frequencies can be interpreted and information arising thereof can be used to alert authorities about the regions where bat infestation is higher, which can call for corrective mechanisms like the use of ultra-sound devices to repel bats and application of bird nets (expensive to and layl) to protect our harvest: proposal #: onion production there are around  farmers, who cultivate around  arpents of land that yield  tonnes of onions annually, this farmer's cooperative faces a number of agronomic hurdles. in particular, seawater infiltration in the coastal areas. infiltration of seawater increases soil salinity and alkalinity, alters soil which negatively impact on the absorption of soil nutrients by plants. yield can be severely affected: soil sensors are available (developed by decagon services, us) that can measure these parameters and feed them to data loggers or other data capture devices (exg: on drones): these data may be utilised by al systems, with minimal human intervention, to effect corrective mechanisms like water flushing systems that will wash out salt accumulations away from the onion production zones. an alert system can also be set up to inform the farmers and authorities of the belle mare region of any additional corrective measures. thrips and leaf miners are pests that severely infest the onion crops. pest infestation by leaf miners can be easily detected via development of serpentine tunnels on the onion leaf by the naked eye computer imaging systems, with drone technology can detect these pests reliably: moreover, multispectral imaging via surveillance cameras can yield valuable information on the health status of crops, well before the pests developed as epidemics the idea behind such detection system is that it does not depend on the poor know-how of farmers on pest identification and also it is done irrespective of climate and time availability (farmers often lack time for pest surveillance and end up preventive spraying causing unnecessary damage to the environment): based on the monitoring of soil properties and crop health status data, wireless transmission from remote sensors can be also developed to feed the al system. this al system shall integrate the sensor data and combines them with climate models and other information to generate effective predictions, for the benefit of farmers without much involving them and extension workers:  mauritius artificial intelligence strategy public buy ph; along they doing

al can also be incorporated to the metro express project to cater about safety, passenger amenities, better revenues, growth and efficiency: al has to be harnessed to find digital innovations for better customer interface and better service delivery for the flagship project challenges developments in the field of al in mauritius will cause authorities to rethink job descriptions and figure out when humans should be at the helm or when should defer to smart machines for safety, cost and capabilities.  there might be high resistance to the implementation of al solutions in mauritius. another major restraint to the growth and development of al in transportation market is the high cost of al system: most of the artificial intelligence applications are complex in nature and so, expensive, which restrict its growth, especially in emerging economies the high cost of al system is due to the following factors: the cost of lidariradar sensor, cameras, gps devices, hard drive, graphics card and other hardware and software devices is high and increases the overall cost of al system: the need of advanced features such as blind spot detection, adas, acc, and control wheel steering also adds up to the total cost of the al system: moreover, worldwide there is no standardization of the sensing infrastructure and al techniques used. infrastructure costs, differing priorities among cities, and the high coordination costs among the parties involved have slowed adoption, as have concerns over privacy related to sensing:  mauritius artificial intelligence strategy they savings very public



artificial intelligence in bpo sector with the emergence of artificial intelligence (al) business process outsourcing companies must evolve to new level: robotic process automation is technology that will allow the bpo sector to be automated by configuring computer software, or ""robot"" to emulate and integrate the actions of a human interacting within digital systems to execute a business process just like the employees do in the bpo industries rpa robots utilize the user interface to capture data and manipulate applications just like humans do. interpret; trigger responses and communicate with other systems in order to perform on a vast variety of repetitive tasks. only substantially better: an rpa software robot never sleeps, makes zero mistakes and costs a lot less than an employee: al and its impacts on bpo sectors as per research, impacts of implementing al in the bpo sector are: employment firstly, there will be huge impact on employment; as many employees will be replaced by al and robotic process automation: according to research carried out in india by us-based research firm hfs research about ,  low skilled workers in it and bpo industry are likely to lose their jobs by . in mauritius there are over ,+ employees in the it and bpo industry: with implementation of al and automation in these sectors there be a number of layoffs. cost of implementation secondly, to set up technologies like al and rpa the cost is very high and bpo companies will need to invest massively for the implementation initially: experts in the field will need to be recruited and equipment will need to be bought from overseas additionally, maintenance cost of such system is very high: furthermore; these technologies are currently in the developing stages even if now invest a lot in the near future will need to spend more money since these technologies are constantly evolving and the bpo will eventually need consistent upgrades: unsatisfied customers artificial intelligence is an area of opportunity that bpo companies will use to bridge the gap with their customers by improving customers engagement and service delivery: however, some higher valued customers may not prefer to receive assistance from robotic process automation as may not get the exact and required assistance need as rpa is pre-programmed to provide certain kind of assistance which are sometimes limited and cannot go in more detail. salary cost since the bpo companies will be automated, fewer employees will be required thus reducing the salary costs_ reduced workload employees in the bpo sector will no longer need to do repetitive tasks that eventually result in health issues such as anxiety, stress and depression: errorless functioning with al and rpa there will be an errorless functioning in the bpo sector as all the tasks performed by these technologies are accurate  | mauritius artificial intelligence strategy they may also, they they they they



artificial intelligence for citizen services and government introduction since the earliest days of the internet; most government agencies have eagerly explored how to use technology to better deliver services to citizens, businesses and other public-sector organizations. early on, observers recognized that these efforts often varied widely in their implementation, and so researchers developed various frameworks to describe the different stages of growth and development of e-government while each model is different; all identify the same general progression from the informational, for example websites that make government facts available online; to the interactive, such as two-way communication between government officials   and users, to the transactional; like  applications that allow users to access government services completely online. however, with the emergence of artificial intelligence (al) e-government must evolve to new level: the perceptive stage. al is technology or system that can emulate human performance; for example, by learning; coming to conclusions or engaging in dialogues with people. machine learning is category of al that aims to extract knowledge or patterns from a series of observations_ the defining feature of the perceptive stage will be that the work involved in interacting with government will be significantly reduced and automated for all parties involved: this   will come about principally from the integration of artificial intelligence (ai) computer systems that can learn, reason and decide at levels similar to that of a human into government services to make it more insightful and intelligent: al and its impact on government while the potential future use cases of al in government remain bounded by government resources and the limits of both human creativity and trust in government; the most obvious and  immediately beneficial opportunities are those where al can reduce administrative burdens, help resolve resource allocation problems, and take on significantly complex tasks. many al case studies in citizen services fall into five categories: answering questions, out and searching documents, routing requests, translation, and drafting documents these applications could make government work more efficient while freeing up time for employees to build better relationships with citizens_ with citizen satisfaction with digital government offerings leaving much to be desired, al may be one way to bridge the gap while improving citizen engagement and service delivery: though al is still in the developing stages, there are steps government agencies can take to lay the foundation for the technology of tomorrow. in particular, investments in modernizing their data architecture and building application programming interfaces so that will be able to use al on the data already collect: in addition, there must be a close collaboration with other external as because most government agencies are not going to have the in-house expertise to build al systems. artificial intelligence is an area of opportunity that government agencies can actively anticipate and plan for when upgrading their legacy systems there are three major ways that al will impact government agencies: first; it will enable government workers to be more productive since the technology can be used to automate tasks_ while computers have already done this to an extent; al allows computers to take on significantly more complex tasks, such as recommending medical treatments al can be used to search for patterns, discover new insights, extract meaning from raw data, make predictions, and interact with people, machines and the physical environment: 2_ second, al will create faster, more responsive government: al enables the creation of autonomous, intelligent agents, for example online catboats that answer citizens' questions, real-time fraud detection systems that constantly monitor government expenditures and virtual legislative assistants that quickly synthesize feedback from citizens to lawmakers  mauritius artificial intelligence strategy they today filling "" today they they many



3_ third, al will allow people to interact more naturally with digital government services. until recently, most interactions with computers required people to adapt to the needs of computers. users buttons on an atm or move mouse on pc, not because these are the most intuitive ways to communicate as human, but because these are the easiest ways to communicate with a computer. but improvements in natural language processing and speech recognition have given rise to virtual assistants like apple's siri, amazon'$ alexa and microsoft's cortana, which allow users to speak to computer much like would a human and increasingly in many different languages for many systemic reasons, government has much room from improvement when it comes to technological advancement: in addition, there is hype around many modern tools, while most government offices are still trying to reach more basic modern operating standards nevertheless, there is benefit in preparing for the future, and making technology investments to pace with trends in how citizens   prefer to engage with service   providers: governments can start thinking  about implementing al by learning from previous country government transformation efforts and al implementations in the private sector_ some strategies can help governments start off on the right foot with al: make al a part ofa goals-based, citizen - centric program; get citizen input; build upon existing resources; be data-prepared and tread carefully with privacy; mitigate ethical risks and avoid al decision making: navigating al in government make al a of a get citizen input build upon goals-based, existing resources citizen-centric program be data-prepared mitigate ethical augment and tread carefully risks and avoid al employees; do not with privacy decision making replace them types of government problems appropriate for al applications resource allocation-administrative support is needed to up task completion and inquiry response times are long due to insufficient support: large datasets-dataset is too large for employees to work with efficiently internal and external datasets can be combined to enhance outputs and insights data is highly structured with years of history procedural-task is repetitive in nature and inputsloutputs have answer diverse data- data includes   visuallspatial and   auditoryllinguistic information qualitative and quantitative data needs to be summarized regularly  mauritius artificial intelligence strategy push they keep part speed binary



recommendations for artificial   intelligence and other   emerging  technologies to have the required impact; both economically and socially, there is the overarching need for a coordinating body with substantial funds to oversee implementation of specific projects, which are detailed in what follows mauritius artificial intelligence council the introduction of the mauritius artificial intelligence council will scale opportunities in this field. the government will be setting up a task force to develop a road map for mauritius which will be responsible for project implementation and monitoring as well as quantifying the socio-economic impacts of the promotion of al. 2_ the council will be, inter-alia, responsible to coordinate with all stakeholders and define specific projects with clear milestones, responsibilities and implementation timelines to foster the al venture in mauritius. 3_ conducive environment should be created and ensured by government; but projects will need to be driven by the private sector to ensure that federating projects have adequate support, implementation capacity and clear and impactful deliverables  the mauritius artificial  intelligence council as announced in the last budget should be responsible to coordinate, monitor and disburse funds for the selected projects, which would be determined in the report of the working group: 5_ the edb will work with other stakeholders in defining the best structure for the council 6_ the maic should further extend its   role in coordinating;  implementing and  monitoring innovative projects and technology adoption such as blockchain and iot amongst others. funding and incentives 7_ the risk for start-ups in al and fintech remains significant: the government should be able to share the risks through an appropriate mechanism which may take the following forms: matching grants, similar to the schemes that exist at the level of the mrc, although care should be taken that the schemes cater for adoption of existing solutions by private companies as well as development of new solutions. tax credits fiscal incentives equity financing training grants (local and abroad) plough-back of profits into investments in al 8_ it was emphasized that the mechanism should take into consideration that the concern will be more on the adoption on al than development:  mauritius artificial intelligence strategy



skills development 9_ globally, governments are all well aware of the limited supply of al talent and are trying to get ahead of the new challenges caused by al. to conduct randd in al and deploy al solutions in the and private sectors, countries need supply of skilled al talent: mauritius is no exception and its success in the al space will be directly related on its ability to train and attract the talent needed for basic al research, the design of applications that use al algorithms and the adoption of al and ai- related technologies by local businesses i0. in the short-term, foreign expertise will need to be brought to mauritius while concurrently training pool of computer scientists and mathematicians, over the medium term, or hsc holders in the longer term to ensure we have sufficient capacity to deploy al solutions in sectors targeted. africa can be target market as well: the right framework to bring in talents from abroad needs revamping: the mauritian diaspora scheme and the innovator's occupation permit exist as possible solutions but remain quite prohibitive and may need to be reviewed by making the conditions less stringent:  in the medium term, an al campus of around i00 students with a tailor-made programme; worked out with the support of the local universities and international experts, could be envisaged: the cost is expected to be around mur / mn, and the course may be designed to be completed in around  months. the trained professionals would help in deploying al solutions across companies and authorities: . existing elective modules at university level should be reviewed and programming and coding should be made mandatory for all subjects. 14_ scholarships for advanced training in al should be made available to locals and foreign students in mauritius: . for longer term solutions, there should be concerted efforts and ramping up of current initiatives to promote science and technology and mathematical literacy, and to increase digital science and al training from the high-school level to the university level. it is important that the pipeline of graduate students in al-related fields should be built through the democratization of science and the promotion of careers in the mathematical sciences from the primary school level. . investments in stem education, national retraining programs, and lifelong learning should be considered to ensure that workers have the skills to compete in the digital economy: training needs to be done in collaboration with universities and associated educational institutions . ""talent watch should be established for the benefit of all ecosystem stakeholders, including educational institutions, which can use it to review their programs accordingly: basically, the ""talent watch"" would be responsible to determine the industry's needs in terms of al and al-related profiles and skills, with a view to matching training to employment: it is thus important to ensure a link and a transparent dialogue between the ""talent watch' and educational institutions. . the approval process at the level of mqa should be reviewed; to allow universities to rapidly amend their training offerings to meet the growing need for a skilled al labour force: interuniversity  mauritius artificial intelligence strategy public



collaboration should be promoted to ensure baseline coordination between university programs and offer substantive training programs that make it possible for students to access the departments and expertise at other universities . while training for professionals in the sector is necessary, the reskilling of workers capable of being displaced needs to be addressed: a scheme should be put in place to enable such workers to acquire skills to improve their occupational mobility: projects . it is proposed that the maic also convers blockchain backed projects to that end, it is advised that that national projects making use of blockchain technology be earmarked and implemented with an aim to test efficiency and build capacity in mauritius projects may include, inter-alia: tax payment; land registration; managing health insurances . al can highly improve the energy sector in mauritius namely by: using lot and neural algorithms to increase energy efficiency; use al in smart systems and improve on efficiency as well as enabling the increase of renewable penetration in the national grid; use of al to perform dynamic energy storage and distribution to reduce storage cost whilst enabling additional renewable energy penetration in the national  the manufacturing sector is in a constant quest for productivity improvement: al can be a enabler in booster efficiency and competitiveness in this sector: proposals include: providing   strong fiscal incentives for the acquisition and  implementation of services and technologies aiming at enabling data acquisition, big data management and data driven operation and maintenance; national productivity and competitiveness council, sme mauritius ltd and other stakeholders to support mentorship and companionship in promoting the implementation of al and related technologies in enterprises; hrdc, mrc, edb, and the maic to support training and randd initiatives to support integration of al to enable gain in productivity and reduction in operation and maintenance cost: . al can give leap   frog move to the healthcare and biotech   industry. proposals and recommendation include, inter-alia, supporting research institutions in building databases of organisms and genomic data of patients; supporting the structuring of projects aiming at developing precision medicines; support e-health initiatives . the agro-industry is in a quest for in productivity to compete with international prices proposed projects to be unrolled with the support of government may include: using neural and   history-based networks to perform   precision   agriculture by   correlating productivity with market demand and value;  mauritius artificial intelligence strategy grid grid key gain



using al supported drone vision for early detection of diseases and supporting harvest; use of lot and al to determine pest and other chemicals requirements and move into precision use of chemicals; use of al to associate sound specificities with prevalence of pests and predators and advise to maintain sustainable population of the latter: . the ocean economy as envisaged to become a pillar of the mauritian economy will require massive data and an ability to translate the data into commercial outputs. al can support several initiatives namely in unrolling the smart port concept which relates to digitalizing all port clearances and ensure logistics optimization. ai can further support the development ofthe marine biotechnology sector by modeling the impact of isolated compounds on specific genomic characteristics . transport combining al with safe city project to model frequency of passengers, optimize transport and security; use of al to monitor of vehicles through image recognition; use of al to monitor effect of infrastructures on traffic and advise and model the impact of new proposed infrastructure on traffic regulatory framework, ethics and data protection . a vital catalyst to artificial intelligence innovation will be a suitably robust legal and regulatory framework at present we are looking to old laws to deal with these new technologies good regulatory policies build public trust: for technologies to receive widespread acceptance, the must be convinced that their safety, privacy and data are safeguarded: . the current regulatory framework furthermore may act as major constraint to instilling randd and innovation in mauritius, especially in terms of defining intellectual property rights which would also need to be well defined. the ip bill should be expedited. . following development of solutions in al, even following government support; the ip should remain in its totality with the private developer. . the current regulations also need to be properly addressed to allow al to develop; especially in fintech and other such areas where outdated regulations in terms of mobile payment; crowdfunding and crowdlending amongst others are hindering the expansion of the sector. . accountability will be a key element to discuss for when things go wrong the question of liabilicy in artificial intelligence is very complex compared to most other environments: given the multiple participants involved in any artificial intelligence value chain, an efficient way of solving the liability problem will be for the various market players to define the parameters of their own liabilities  the al ecosystem should be ethical, and therefore, a permanent committee on ethics should be set up to maintain the dialogue and formulate proposals to maintain a healthy relationship between al and humans.  mauritius artificial intelligence strategy key public speed public
