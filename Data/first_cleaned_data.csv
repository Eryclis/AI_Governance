These reports shall be presented to NAIF BoD for review and decisionmaking ..3Catalyzing Social Development through Al by National Initiatives From global perspective of servicetechnology adoption, it is witnessed that the social sector usually misses out on the early adoption of cuttingedge technologies such as Al due to its magnitude, lack of coherence, and service complexities. On the contrary, the sectorial approach is swift but in siloes, and therefore, desired performance targets are challenging The Government of Pakistan is aware of data orchestration and management issues in the social sector. Due to these challenges, National developmental drive via focused national projects is necessitated through this initiative by directly investing in a handful of priority areas for improving service delivery Following are the National Al Initiatives that shall be undertaken to bring Al applications into the mainstream to achieve socioeconomic deliverables and ensure sustainable outcomes ... Data Standardization and Aggregation for Servicification The National and Provincial governments possess heterogeneous datasets through various verifiable and unverifiable sources and require orchestration bottomup for secure and transparent use Suppose the social data is standardized and made available by the private sector for public service provisioning in structured environment In that case, it can help reduce time to service due to process cluttering and ensure seamless application of Al and allied technologies in an integrated manner. Immediate actions required in this regard are The CoEAl shall organize a common and sectoral data collection and processing mechanism for unstructured, semistructured, and structured datasets for the data available in the public sector and accessible through market regulators for the private sector Il, CoEAl shall undertake the data standardization in the identified priority social sectors under a Common Operating Environment COE such as Healthcare, Legal, Public Facilitation Services, Education, Food Security, and essential Utilities electricity, gas, drinking water, water, sewage, and cleaning services Il These standards shall be implemented via NationalProvincial IT Boards across the country by standardizing data collection and processing under different Management Information Systems operating in various departmentsinstitutions. Furthermore, the available data should be available to these NationalProvincial IT Boards to develop a standard data exchange system IV In another scenario, where there is yet to be digitized for seamless collection, especially in the identified social sectors, the NationalProvincial IT Boards in support of CoEAl, while exercising their mandate, shall assist such NationalProvincial institutions in digitizing data on the given standards for early alignment V Under the Cloud First Policy of the Government of Pakistan, although the enduser department shall remain the custodian of acquired data, a copy of such data public data must be hosted on the National Telecom Corporation NTC cloud infrastructure nationwide. Moreover,   NationalProvincial IT Boards shall act as controllers and processors of such data while assisting the concerned departments in secure and effective service provisioning VI. AIl such data shall be well backed up on the industrys best practices and made available in controlled environment to CoEAl to access and use to develop different Al algorithms for datasystem integrations and intelligent service offerings through prescribed processes with incremental value addition VII Such Al algorithms shall be made available to the private sector entities for sectorial sandboxing and subsequent service provisioning while always remaining compliant with the sandbox and available for systemservice audit. ViII Smart citybased projects are already in the deployment phase in several cities in Pakistan CoE Al shall support in indigenization of computer vision technology by standardization targeting high accuracy of person and object detection. Computer Visionbased surveillance application poses significant potential to contribute to the safety of citizens Therefore, CoEAl shall accelerate the technology rollout to even smaller cities in Pakistan All the identified institutions in clause vide ... IVIII above are hereby directed based on constitutional stipulations to work coherently to solve citizens' problems and always offer data to CoEAl for Albased service and analytical transformation ... National Health Services Transformation using AI This program aims to help prevent and better manage chronic diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol, to reduce the risk of complications like heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Many Pakistanis have chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and high blood cholesterol They may be unaware ofthese conditions asthe symptoms may not be noticeable early on. However, these diseases can lead to severe complications such as heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, and even death ifnot well controlled. Similarly, one of the biggest challenges in Al proliferation in the healthcare sector is the digitization of a massive volume of data available in hospitals and health institutes in hardcopies However, even if the data is digitized in some institutes and hospitals, it is not standardized, and that hinders the accessibility of data and eventual processing CoEAl shall support the Ministry of National Health Services Regulation and Coordination in better controlling chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and high blood cholesterol. CoEAl shall develop guidelines for healthcare providers to become more productive and help patients control chronic disease conditions using the latest Al technology Al can analyze clinical data, medical images, health behaviors, and genomic data to create customized individual risk score. This score can help individuals take appropriate preventive measures and receive earlier and more targeted interventions from their care teams. Patients at higher risk of complications can be identified earlier and provided with more intensivve management and monitoring in the primary care setting to reduce the likelihood of medical complications CoEAl shall establish working groups with the Ministry of National Health Services Regulation and Coordination to establish the framework of medical data standardization along with the relevant organizations Il Al can support primary care doctors and care teams in developing personalized care plans considering a patient's risk profile As each care team may look after many patients, Al can also assist in monitoring the progress and alert care teams to patients whose progress shows cause for concern to take timely action CoEAl shall actively develop and support such initiatives. IV Al can make it easier for patients to selfmanage their conditions. For example, patients can use Al to monitor their health status and receive timely reminders to eat healthily, increase physical  activity, take medication, and report for checkups. As a result citizens will enjoy improved health outcomes and be empowered to better selfmanage chronic diseases. CoEAI shall support the indigenization of Al products for personal healthcare V CoEAI shall undertake the digitalization of medical data and its management It would help maintain patients' histories, which can be invaluable in precision medicine and RandD ... Intelligent Learning and Assessment Al Every individual in society has a different capacity to comprehend and retain new information and level of skill in a particular trade. Also, they have different aptitudes and learning needs Therefore, teachers cannot personalize every individual's learning experience, especially in the subjects where a particular skill is to be taught The following points discuss the prospects of Al applications CoEAl shall develop a comprehensive program to provide a personalized learning and assessment mechanism by imparting Albased adaptive skill assessment and training based on modern curriculum. All these activities shall be organized in publicprivate partnerships. The program shall be managed through existing institutions, while CoEAl shall only offer guidelines based on market needs and the latest technological advancements through its team of experts from the industry and academia. Il. Initially, the program shall be launched on a pilot basis in all the public institutions in the Federal Capital however, upon the program's outcomes and with necessary pivots and iterations, the program shall be spread nationwide, ensuring authenticity and transparency of the trained resources ... National loT Data Cluster The main challenge for the successful implementation of IoT Cloudbased services is the availability of data in digital form and the standardization of the data. Unfortunately, Pakistan's government and public organizations are sitting on vast amounts of data that have yet to be digitalized and then standardized so that it can be used in predictive analytics, Machine LearningDeep Learning, and other technological uses The following points discuss the prospects of Al applications CoEAl shall establish loT cloudbased services at subsidized rates It will offer a faster learning experience and support for academia. CoEAl shall promote loTbased applications Improve the quality of Cloud and loTbased technologies and will provide stateoftheart facilities for predictive analytics and the generation of insights for various industries. Il The initiative shall invite local and international companies to provide loTbased Cloud services on competitive grounds. ... Agriculture Supply Chain Optimization The biggest challenge in the agricultural sector regarding supply chain optimization is data digitization and standardization Accessibility is another challenge that can only be addressed after digitization and standardization of available data. Therefore, to fuel Big Data Analytics, vital for any supply chain management and inventory management systems to be provided with standardized data. The following points discuss the prospects of Al applications The initiative under CoEAl shall provide predictive analytics for streamlining the supply and demand of the agricultural supply chain, which will assist in streamlining supply and demand mechanisms through predictive analytics In addition, it will help in reducing wastage by optimizing the inventory management system It will establish weather prediction systems to assist farmers in making informed decisions based on weather predictions about the cultivation and harvest of crops.  using  I The program shall employ loTs and sensor technology for soil monitoring systems ... EKhidmat Centers .

Following legislative measures have been taken considering Digitization and technological advancement in Pakistan Al Governance  countries across the globe have passed  Alrelated bills by , Personal Data Protection Act . Regulations  of those bills have been passed into law . Digital Pakistan Policy Pakistan Cloud Policy Pakistan IT Policy   . Market Challenges The evidence furnished above simplifies the identification of challenges leading to pragmatic market support and only necessary interventions. These challenges are ... G1 Awareness and Adaptation Challenges It is becoming increasingly important that society is aware of the potential of Al in solving routine matters This requires an awareness campaign towards controlling and sharing data, basic skills education, and highimpact skilling at all levels of the community for sustainable growth Nations dominating the Al and allied technologies arena have instituted welldefined Human Capital development and evolution mechanisms to prepare the future generation for Al adoption in various sectors through sizable publicprivate investments and to retain the talent locally Moreover, international universities have inculcated Albased curricula in their primary, high school, undergraduate, and postgraduate programs to ensure that Al is adopted in a structured manner offering comprehensive development plan for its role in different phases of life and work In Pakistan, enabling Al and allied technologies is challenging without having basic level of awareness about the technology at the user level. It should be complemented with skilled human resources, having a broader understanding of how and where Al should be applied and the best practices in this technology for its effective and responsible use. The major hurdle in preparing Al trained human capital is the access to data needed to train them in various domains of Albased technologies. Hence, data is the underlying artefact for putting skilled human capital to work and making them experiment with using Albased models in a controlled yet agile environment IM. Al adoption would disrupt how work will be done in public and private sectors and various industries, directly affecting the country's socioeconomic fabric People working in traditional ways and not skilled in Albased technologies are at risk of losing their jobs if not pivoted timely This issue must be addressed on priority basis, which can only be done through awareness and upskilling Customized learning programs, workshops, and courses can assist such individuals in surviving this transition and becoming an integral part of digitally transformed workplaces. IV. According to the surveys, at a sectoral scale, half of the respondents are well versed with Al and related technologies, while the other half possess working knowledge. To teach an Albased curriculum, the survey findings point to including short courses and  monthlong boot campsdiplomas urgently. Furthermore, bachelor'smaster's level programs and Ph.D. degrees in Al are also worth considering The significant adaptation challenges towards Al proliferation include digitization of information, digital access, literacy, and digital inclusion by design Heaps of data are available in the public and private sectors, either difficult to access or not available appropriately such as in hard copies In many cases, it has been observed that data digitalization and basic process automation in confined environment are considered sufficient due to a lack of awareness Alternatively, Cloud based solutions using Al for dataprocess orchestration, management, and analytics offered as SaaS provides greater access. However, with limited knowledge, such services are never done justice in terms of their utilization. Moreover, in several cases, local SMEs and enterprises are not using Al and allied technologies effectively, leading to demandside paralysis. For instance, digitizing healthcarerelated data is essential in getting patients' history accessible to the doctors as well as various diagnostic and RandD. Unfortunately, the healthcare sector is digitized at fundamental level with limited or zero technological transformation and the standardization of data, which is a significant hurdle in enabling Albased advancement in the healthcare sector. VI. Digital literacy is another challenge as people are to be educated about data digitization and accessibility and how to adopt safe datasharing mechanisms. Moreover, it needs to be organized   to allow equal opportunity for children, women from remote areas, and disabled persons to benefit from the Al proliferation efforts and meet future challenges ... G2 Data Standardization and Accessibility Globally, leaders in Al proliferation have made data standardization and accessibility their top priority. For example, China used the vast datasets available from the provinces to train Al and allied technologies, especially in the healthcare sector. As a result it took the burden from the hospitals and medical practitioners. Estonia is another shining example of data standardization and accessibility that enabled the small European country to lead in Al adoption. Organizations obtain data from several resources Ifthis data from disparate sources is not brought to common operating environment, it will create significant problems in its processing for different purposes and uses Therefore, Pakistan' primary issue is to digitize and organize the massive datasets available in various inaccessible forms and make them available in a standardized form to make them more relevant for data analytics and other data processing mechanisms. This is only achievable through sustainable developmental hubs and associated collaborations in different sectors. I. Data standardization has been done in the financial sector according to international standards to retain a competitive edge Most companies in the IT industry have also ensured standardization and accessibility However, as learned through the survey, other sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, retail and commerce, and healthcare lag significantly in this domain. Significant efforts are required to develop andaugment an ecosystem that catalyzes the countrys adoption of Aland allied technologies Moreover, the lack of accessibility to data hinders Albased RandD, predictive analytics, and various other Albased technologies from producing valuable outputs. It adversely affects advancement in research and development and Al proliferation The survey results report a. The lack of accessibility of data has been pointed out by  of the stakeholders, which is a prerequisite to Al adoption in any sector. b  of the stakeholders shared their concerns about data not being standardized C.  of respondents consider poor data collection practices a crippling factor for successful Al adoption. d  of the stakeholders recommend following leaders in Al adoption, such as the UK, Estonia, and China, for data standardization mechanisms ... G3 Computational Infrastructure Situation and Needs Developed countries and the countries which have made significant progress in Al proliferation have ensured the availability of computational equipment and facilities to the stakeholders and institutions to train the human capital and streamline the modernization of processes to ensemble sustainable Al outfit However, such efforts need resources these countries have ensured and made available to the relevant stakeholders Il. Limited computational resources are a shared obstacle by various sectors of Pakistan The need for computational facilities is emphasized for providing robust and secure access to infrastructure for complex RandD and highperforming systems. Furthermore, these computational facilities are essential for any initiative to train human resources in Al and allied technologies. Their availability under one roof is necessary to streamline the training and learning process. Il. Similarly, in many cases, the computational resources are not used optimally. Therefore, nationalprovincial data repository of all the public sector data can be made available to a broader audience via securecontrolled channel There is also strong need for training on high performance computing technologies so that indigenous customized solutions can meet local computational requirements within the country   IV.  of stakeholders have registered concerns regarding the limited availability of computational resources as a barrier to achieving a trained workforce in Al and allied technologies. To augment applied research and provide robust and secure access to infrastructure for complex RandD, computational facilities are considered vital by  of stakeholders. ... G4 Ethical Challenges Safe and secure data sharing and ethical adoption of Al and allied technologies are primary concerns for every stakeholder, national or international At global level, various countries that have adopted Al formulated guidelines and principles for the ethical use of Al and related technologies and established regulatory framework to streamline safe and secure datasharing mechanisms. Regulatory challenges must be addressed to establish an environment of trust Moreover, it is the users' fundamental right that their data be safe and that their privacy is always upheld. Therefore, an effective regulatory system that may steer Al adoption, related initiatives, and datasharing mechanisms is needed Most stakeholders voted various risks associated with Al adoption medium to high, including malicious intent data pollution, Data model theft, fairness, precision deterioration, invasion of privacy, etc   References  B.

Data in particular has become an essential resource to countries, some calling it 'the new oil, to illustrate the tremendous opportunities it creates in terms of efficiency, development of Al solutions, and public services A large number of datagenerated opportunities create value, both social and financial. Countries learning to maximize data collection opportunities, processing, and integration into valuable solutions, will significance, both in the short and long term KSA has a critical role in developing the Data Al agenda to position the country in the league of datadriven economies KSA displays attractive characteristics to serve as our foundation for success We have a unique scale in industries and investment powerhouse with an appetite for the tech industry We also have a thriving environment for test  beds in new smart cities such as NEOM and a unique data infrastructure with centralized ecosystem In parallel, we are hosting key international events on Data and Al To support this wide variety of efforts, Saudi Data and Al Authority SDAIA has recently been established to support and drive the KSA Data and Al agenda To capitalize on Data and Al for the Kingdom economically and socially through national combined efforts by all stakeholders SDAIA has developed the National Strategy for Data and AI. This ecosystem will help us achieve our ambitious vision to be the place Where the best of Data and Al is made reality We will deploy our best capabilities to invest in the field National Strategy for Data and Al  gain  . We aim to achieve this ambitious longterm vision through a multiphased approach focused on addressing the national priorities by , building foundations for competitive advantage in niche areas by , and becoming one of the leading economies utilizing and exporting Data and Al after . More concretely, the realization of this vision is based on six dimensions which by the time it is fully achieved, would have KSA become DIMENSION  Ambition The global hub where the best of Data and Al is made reality We are aiming to be at the center of a large local and international network of partners DIMENSION  Skills The source of a steady local supply of Data Al talent DIMENSION  Policies and Regulations top destination for Data and Al stakeholders by creating attractive and businessfriendly policies and regulatory environment to achieve their full potential DIMENSION  Investment A place where investments are facilitated for the most promising Data and Al projects DIMENSION  Research and Innovation An international platform for priority Research and Innovation Rel activities in Data and Al topics to spearhead innovation and impact creation DIMENSION  Ecosystem The host of a groundbreaking and stimulating Infrastructure to enable the realization of the Data and Al potential National Strategy for Dataand ALLZ key key  . INTERNATIONAL LANDSCAPE IN DATA and Al Since the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence in , where the term Al was coined by Professor John McCarty, Data and Al have mainly been fields of specialists in academic institutions, government, and private research organizations However the recent years have been characterized by a shift of interest towards the public sphere to include political actors, the general public, and private companies in nearly all sectors  . Two main trends have contributed to this shift First, the extensive use of digital applications by the general public, such as natural language processing has generated a significant amount of data essential to Al development The other factor has been the fast developments in computing capabilities enabling the processing of increasingly large amounts of data This development happened in parallel with significant advances in machine learning a branch of Al. Data and Al are already disrupting several sectors and will become a factor in economic development While  tremendous amount of opportunities are provided by Al solutions disaster management, road safety or energy consumption management some challenges are emerging data protection automation cybersecurity In order for societies to benefit from the opportunities provided by Data and Al and to address the challenges and threats they generate, governments have been framing their approach to support and regulate Data and Al. There are currently around  governments that have developed or are developing a national Al strategy in the past two to three years One of the central issues where government action is expected will be around data sharing and open data strategies Countries have adopted different approaches to collect, generate, and process data Countries also took strides in making public data available, ranging from limited data releases to open data by default Having large amounts of data available to public, private, academic, and research actors would provide economic benefits increased citizens engagement attractive environment for investors and accelerating innovation For example, having access to data from municipalities can support local government in designing policies and public services taking into account the specific needs of populations key key  . KSA'S LANDSCAPE INCLUDING OPPORTUNITIES X CHALLENGES As a G20 country, it is necessary for KSA to bring its contribution and to benefit from the immense opportunities data and Al would generate for the countrys development Becoming a key international actor in the field of Data and Al would require significant investments upskilling and regulatory measures to create and enable the development of a domestic ecosystem KSAs landscape including opportunities and challenges  . We are writing a new chapter for our generation and many others to come We acknowledge that data is the oil of the 21st century, and we have therefore set for our nation a clear vision to elevate the country to a leading position among the world's pioneering Data and Aldriven economies In fact the largescale transformation Saudi Arabia is going through under Vision  requires the fast integration of the most advanced technological capabilities to accelerate the transition To achieve this vision efficiently, we need to make the right datadriven decisions, and this requires a lot of meaningful data, and the full power to unlock and to generate as many deep insights from the data as possible, and here comes the role of Artificial Intelligence. Saudi Arabia has long been recognized as powerhouse of the Middle East Saudi displays several unique strategic advantages The potential lies in UNIQUE SECTORS AT SCALE AND INVESTMENT POWERHOUSE Unique sectors at scale and an investment powerhouse with tech appetite through the Public Investment Fund PIF and the vision fund LARGE SCALE TRANSFORMATION PROGRAMS KSA's top leadership is committed to making change happen and to embrace the latest technologies YOUNG AND VIBRANT POPULATION  of the population are under  years and are deeply entwined with the digital economy THRIVING ENVIRONMENT FOR TESTBEDS IN NEWISMART CITIES Proliferation of new and smart cities such as NEOM that will provide opportunities to explore untested areas in Data Al Ndtional Strategy for Dath and Al    .

Within NIC, Estishraf was created to act as the provider of insights Estishraf uses government data to support the decisionmaking process The work is supervised by multidisciplinary teams in order to improve the value of the extracted insights,address priorities for government leaders, and to improve the lives of citizens through better government services NDMO manages national data as a digital asset and is responsible for the development of standards, policies and regulations as well as driving compliance On policies and regulations, NDMO is developing a number of regulatory frameworks including topics such as data privacy and freedom of information In particular Open Data has been identified as a priority topic, and the government has already made investments in open data platforms NCAI will drive Al strategy execution, orchestrate Al research focused on innovations in the field of Data and Al, develop Al solutions and build Al expertise National Strategy for Data and AI  Key key  . In order to cultivate Data and Al skills and talent, selected private schools introduced Al to the curriculum Ministry of Communications and Information Technology MCIT introduced training programs focused on machine learning to be infused into the Ministry of Education MoE curricula STEM trainings and courses were introduced to enhance Al and technology skills. In addition, there are several Al boot camps currently held in KSA Furthermore, to facilitate research and innovation and research activities, the Al Center of Advanced Studies Thakaa was established In parallel the AbdulAziz City for Science and Technology KACST created a Data Analytics and Al Center providing best in class research environment KSA's commitment to Data and Al is also shown through the large scale investments made in technologies that leverage Data and Al Notably, the Saudi Government has made multi billion investments in Tesla, Uber Softbank Group Corp. and Virgin Group. In addition Ministry of Investment Saudi Arabia MISA is working to attract foreign Al companies to start investing and operating in KSA Finally, numerous Vision  projects aim to leverage Data and AI. NEOM is seeking to harness the power of Data and Al seamlessly into every aspect of citizens' lives KSA is also set to host the Global Al Summit that boldly explores all aspects of AI, including its impact on socioeconomic development and challenges the global community is facing Nattonal strategy fer Date A  Key King  . DATA X AI VISION and STRATEGIC DIRECTION  . KSA'S DATA and Al VISION and STRATEGIC DIRECTION KSA'S NATIONAL DATA and Al VISION Attractive ecosystem worldclass infrastructure, testbed environments Development, creation data governance, commercial and adoption of Data and Al incentives govtsponsored technologies across the Kingdom incentives minimum redtape, unique Where the best of Data and Al is made reality Innovative, sustainable, practical and ethical Data and Al applications  . This longterm Data and AI strategy is an integral part of the transformative journey the Kingdom is going through The development of megacities, the unprecedented educational reform the government has engaged as well as the emergence of new sectors such as tourism, all require mobilizing the most advanced technological capabilities, skills and investments. The National Strategy for Data and Al will fulfill the Vision  aspiration We aim at scaling Data and Al applications and build the foundations for a strong economy This would enable us to ultimately become users and exporters of Data and Al enabled products and services To serve this ambition, we will make full use of the countrys leadership support and the large government investments creating tremendous testbed opportunities. We will also develop a strong Data and Al domestic workforce at different levels, create an attractive regulatory and investment environment for domestic and foreign investment promote top level research and innovation, as well as a competitive domestic ecosystem enabled by international partnerships and networks. All the initiatives we will launch will integrate the best sustainability and ethical standards available Making Saudi Arabia the place where the best of Data Al is made reality is not only a government objective but also a societal aspiration which requires all the stakeholders government private sector academic institutions, specialist general workforce, and the wider public to contribute to its success atonal Strategy for Data and Al  key  .

National Strategy for Data and AI  key key  . As a result, this strategy would concentrate on the first phase This first phase is about maximizing the use cases of Data and Al to achieve the objectives set under Vision  and accompany the transition and focus on key domains and niche topics to serve on the international scene. This includes Supporting data and skills within both government and the private sector to prepare for  growing labor market demand Enhancing the regulatory environment to enable the development of a performing domestic ecosystem Creating sectorspecific Data and Al plans Driving adoption of data management standards and policies across governement entities to collect data in readable and usable formats Creating dynamic domestic and healthy Data and Al startup ecosystem This would require government support such as the establishment of a favorable regulatory environment credit facilities and trainings Building highly qualified national talents to respond to the needs of the market Attracting sustained private and international investment into the Saudi market Elevating Data and Al RSI capabilities, quality and commercialization outcomes and establishing testbeds in new and smart cities Building on the first phase would allow for setting the foundations for a new strategy after  to establish a Data and Al industry to compete on the global scene  . Our vision is translated into six strategic objectives OBJECTIVE  Position KSA as the global hub where the best of Data  Al is made reality KSA's vision as an internationalregional hub for Data and Al activities requires solid presence on the global landscape of Data and Al through publicly available contributions Therefore, we are developing a comprehensive plan for KSAs contributions in globallocal Data and Al global initiatives and events In fact we are planning to host the first Global Al summit in KSA The Summit will be a unique annual platform for global thought leaders, decisionmakers and innovators to showcase, debate and shape the future agenda of Al for governments, private sector and NOOs, to amplify Al's positive value for humanity OBJECTIVE  Transform KSA's workforce with a steady local supply of Data and Al empowered talents Data and Al are transforming labor markets globally Most sectors will have to adapt in order to maximize the benefits this transformation is bringing The faster we are in integrating Data and Al into our education system, professional trainings and into general public knowledge, the greater advantage we will gain in terms of employment productivity and innovation As for most countries undergoing the Data and Al transition, the Kingdom, with its ambitious plan to develop its Data and Al sector will face a skills shortage. Most governments and private sector companies globally are competing to attract data scientists, data architects, coders and many of the professions needed to build Data and Al capabilities. The same actors are making efforts to attract talent from overseas but they also invest in the development of their own workforce While this strategy aims at attracting foreign talent it is crucial for the country to sustainably develop local talent and to provide the necessary incentives fof them to stay in Saudi Arabia Developing local talent requires to concentrater on three categories of the workforce Natiohal Strategy for Data and AI  key  . Data Al experts specialists committed to innovation activities Data and Al specialists graduates from the field and who can potentially support its development General workforce labor force not necessarily working on Data Al topics but whose literacy in the field needs to be strengthened For the three categories, there should be an adapted effort in order to build the local workforce. Within the framework of this strategy, we aim at creating educational tracks in Data and Al in K and university degrees, some of which leading to specialist tracks supported by educational scholarships and professional training We are also strengthening our cooperation with academic institutions while developing a certification program to recognize the efforts of professionals interested in developing Data and AI skills OBJECTIVE  Enact the most welcoming legislation for Data and Al businesses and talents Our goal is to develop welcoming flexible, and stable regulatory frameworks and incentives schemes to attract companies, investors and talents. Regulations will also focus on developing adaptive policy frameworks and standards on Data and Al including the ethical use of Al. These policies will provide direction to stakeholders and certainty over Data and Al activities. As part of providing an attractive regulatory framework for Data and Al investments and businesses, we aim at having strong framework to promote and support ethical development of Data and Al research and solutions This framework will provide guidelines for the development of our data protection and privacy standards. This is beneficial to both society as well as businesses and investors who need a stable regulatory framework to operate in the Kingdom National Strategy for Data and AI  key  . In addition, the creation of and access to open data is a crucial asset which any strong Data and Al ecosystem will need. Opening government data provides significant opportunities to public and private sector organizations as well as individuals It would contribute to creating an attractive environment for startups, provide visibility on policy formation decisionmaking and drive economic growth and innovation Therefore, our ambition is to rollout open data by default the implication being that all government data should be published as long as it does not compromise security, data protection, and privacy However this initiative requires a strong regulatory framework to provide high standards in terms of data protection and privacy, in line with our ethical approach to developing our data sector Doing this would define the framework through which government and private organizations will be able to benefit from the opportunities provided by data The regulatory framework will include specifications on data collection, classification, sharing, open data policy and freedom of information In order to achieve this, we will collaborate across government to ensure data is captured in readable formats, then start publishing the most timely and comprehensive datasets, to ultimately rollout open data by default across government entities after . This illustrates our effort to facilitate access to public data for organizations contributing to the development of the sector This process starts with data collection where a standardized format will be required to capture data, followed by the publication of initial datasets from selected government organizations ministries, agencies, or other, to test adoption from interested organizations This twostep initial phase would take place over the  period before transitioning to scaling our open data by default program across the wholeofgovernment from  onwards National Strategy Rata1AX  .   INITIATE ADOPT SCALE and EXCEL Launch government  Publish additional Rollout open data wide open data data sets from by default across policy and ensure that select ministries government data is captured in a with the most timely readable form and comprehensive data sets In collaboration with NDMO and sector regulators   Enable entities to mature, create Data open critical mass and enforce regulations by default Ongoing efforts are made under Vision  to promote doing business in the Kingdom Our objective as part of this strategy is to ensure private sector development ambitions also benefit Data and Al. Therefore, we will build an incentive package aimed at attracting foreign companies and facilitating the creation of local businesses in the Data and Al sector This would encourage foreign firms to invest in the Kingdom and facilitate knowledge transfer to empower local firms  . OBJECTIVE  Attract efficient, stable funding for qualified Data and Al investment opportunities Our goal is to incentivize and enable local and foreign investors to effectively identify and fund available Data and Al investment opportunities in KSA We will build targeted funds and investor support programs to attract and guide domestic and foreign investments in Data and Al The Data and Al sector in KSA will need large amounts of investments to grow These investments can be encouraged by a fund that adds incentives by reducing the risk of subsidizing returns Therefore, we will setup a fundfinancial mechanism incentivizing Foreign Direct Investment local investments in Data and Al priority areas We will invest in relevant cuttingedge Data and Al applications to the KSA market and new promising technologies to firstmover advantage. We will also setup an investors' support program providing professional services such as investment screening and business plan development The ace of technological innovation in the Data and Al sector generates a continuous need to adapt Our support would provide guidance to both foreign and domestic investors on the Saudi ecosystem in terms of domestic financial facilities, the regulatory framework as well as the business ecosystem high potential startups, projects, and planned initiatives National Strategy fok Data AI  gain key  . OBJECTIVE  Empower top Data and Al institutions to spearhead innovation and impact creation Fostering an environment conducive to innovation is a critical element for Data and Al exploration. Our goal is to elevate the quantity and quality of Data and Al REl capabilities including researchers, equipment topics, commercialization vehicles, while expanding the capacity in new areas in Data and Al KSA has and unique offering for innovation, as it is currently developing multiple gigaprojects where technology is a central highpriority The proliferation of these new and smart cities will constitute the best environment for new and creative use of Data and AI. These cities will become testbeds to innovative use of Al across multiple domains such as policies and regulations, and algorithms and applications development We will aim to develop specialized clusters and hubs focused on providing a collaborative and forward thinking environment for researchers to come and explore the latest Data and Al possibilities As a result innovation and research are expected to be centered not only around technological development but also in terms of Data and Al policies and regulations, developing ethical frameworks and the integration of Alenabled solutions into megacities' design We will also focus on expanding current Data and Al RandI capabilities. As a result, we aim at increasing the number of high quality Rel papers to capture the most promising initiatives and contribute to the advancement of the sector globally This will require close cooperation with both international and domestic academic institutions National Strategy for Data and Al   . OBJECTIVE  Stimulate Data and Al adoption with the most collaborative, and forwardthinking ecosystem One of the key success factors for Data and Al strategies will be attributed to the adoption of innovative solutions enabled by Data and Al, across the public and private sectors, as well as individuals Developing a robust digital infrastructure that developers could utilize would be of utmost importance. In addition, public awareness of ongoing activities will be key to ensuring citizen understanding of the benefits generated by the fast emergence of a high number of Data and Al practical applications We will also develop sectorspecific Data and Al plans. These sectors will be identified based on the current digital maturity of each sector alignment with Vision  objectives and Data and Al expected impact In fact while all sectors will be disrupted to a certain extent, some sectors will expect major shifts due to Data and Al In order to promote nationwide Al adoption and utilization, it is crucial to provide the opportunity for individuals and small businesses to access wellestablished and sophisticated Data and Al platforms. We will develop sectorfocused partnerships in the domain of Data and Al platforms and provide accessible Data and Al platforms at country level through partnerships with major companies with efficient and sophisticated platforms. Promoting close cooperation within the ecosystem to include all key stakeholders such as the government businesses, academic institutions, financial actors and the general public to develop linkages which are essential to achieve scale.

Organisations not only need the ability to access the large volume of data generated by loTSG devices, but they also need infrastructure capable of achieving value through computation and data processing Digital infrastructure refers to the systems which connect people to digital information, products, and services. It serves as the backbone of the digital economy and includes both hard physical and soft nonphysical digital infrastructure comprising connectivity devices, data storage and processing services, and applications. Similar to the way cables, wires, and generators provide for the electricity needs of citizens, digital infrastructure enables transmission of information and data, underpinning our social and economic lives Digital infrastructure once required large upfront investment in equipment such as fiber optics, satellites, and highpowered computing facilities, highly flexible and elastic ondemand cloud computing services. At present, there is shift from capital expenditure to operational expenditure, lowering the barrier to entry for individuals, businesses, and governments. Strategy  emphasizes the digital infrastructure that needs to be enabled to support the Al implementation The nationwide AlRmap survey indicates that only  of the responding organizations are at the initial implementation of the digital infrastructure and data activities.

This latent workforce that has retired has to be brought back at work. Women make up most of the Al talents who chose to leave the workforce Women in Al programmes harness their talents  and  will  Strategic Initiative . Offering Comprehensive and Inclusive Al Education Talent development is core in building the workforce of the future. Education is the best way to prepare future talents with knowledge in Al. The ability to identify how Al can be utilized in various situations must be nurtured and reinforced throughout the education process. education must be comprehensive, where Al is introduced at all levels, beginning from the school level, up to tertiary level. Our children are growing up with various instances of Al driven devices and services An intensive Al for Kids and program introduces school children to basic principles of how Al operates and what Al is capable of. Hence, this program will shape these children's mental models of what Al is and how it manifests, that they will not overestimate capabilities of Al.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY . INTRODUCTION Artificial intelligence AT  and data analytics have the potential to enhance social wellbeing and are increasingly being to various business areas to improve operational efficiency and to provide new services, but at the same time this can about different challenges. It is important for organisations to consider AI and data ethics when implementing Information Technology IT projects and providing services. When organisations are considering the application of Al and data analytics, they need to consider range of factors such as the requirements of relevant legislation and stakeholder expectations on the applicable ethical standards of data and technology that appropriately reflect the value and culture of the local community. The Ethical Artificial Intelligence Framework called the Ethical AI Framework hereunder document consists of Tailored AI Framework for ethical use of Al and big data analytics when implementing IT projects and An assessment template used to complete AI Assessment for AI and data analytics to assess the implications of AI applications In this document, the term AI is used to refer to analytic operations involving big data analytics, advanced analytics and machine learning that use massive data sets and processing capabilities to find correlations and make predictions. The term AI applications has been used to refer to a collective set of applications whose actions, decisions 0r predictions are empowered by AI models. Examples of AI applications are IT projects which have prediction functionality andor model development involving training data. For IT projects that have AL applications, organisations can make reference to the requirements of the Ethical Al Framework The adoption of Ethical AI Framework is a step that establishes a common approach and structure to govern the development and deployment of Al applications with the intention to maximise the benefits of the application of AI in IT projects based on the following guiding principles Facilitate organisations to understand the application of Al and big data analytics in their respective business areas Complement other operating guidelines eg privacy, security and data management Foster and guide the ethical use of Al and big data analytics in the organisation  big applied bring big big  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Facilitate organisations to consider requirements o AI ethics relevant to their business and technical domains, govern and assess the compliance of the IT projects and Assist organisations on identifying and managing potential risks in adopting Al and big data analytics in IT projects by conducting AI Assessment . WHAT IS THE ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK? The Ethical AI Framework was originally developed to assist government bureauxdepartments BIDs in planning, designing and implementing Al and big data analytics in their IT projects and services. It consists of guiding principles, leading practices and AI Assessment that should be adopted for BDs' AIpowered IT projects. The AI Assessment includes assessment template for BDs to utilise at application level which would support BIDs o the management of benefits, impact and risks. Nonetheless this framework, including guiding principles, practices and assessment template, is also applicable to other organisations in general and this customised version of framework is suitably revised e.g removal or adjustment of government specific terms for general reference by organsiations when adopting Al and big data analytics in their IT projects.

Please refer to Section . Components and Relationships for details.  Key  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The AI Assessment includes an assessment template for organisations to assess the benefits, impact and risks of AI applications An AI Application Impact Assessment is used to assess AI applications to ensure that the impact across the AI Lifecycle is managed and that related Ethical Al Principles have been considered. Please refer to Section  AI Assessment for details. Existing standards and practices e.g project management, IT security standards should be used as part of the overall framework for managing IT projects Al applications would be a subset of these projects. EthicalAL Principles Twelve Ethical AI Principles should be observed for all AI projects. Two out of the twelve principles  Transparency and Interpretability and  Reliability, Robustness and Security are 'Performance Principles These fundamental principles must be achieved to create a foundation for the execution of other principles For example, without achieving the Reliability Robustness and Security principle, it would be impossible to accurately verify that other Ethical AI Principles have always been followed. The other principles are categorised as General Principles , including  Fairness,  Diversity and Inclusion,  Human Oversight  Lawfulness and Compliance,  Data Privacy, Safety,  Accountability,  Beneficial AI,  Cooperation and Openness and  Sustainability and Just Transition. are derived from the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Ordinances Principle Definition Transparency and Organisations should be able to explain the decisionmaking processes Interpretability of the Al applications to humans in a clear and comprehensible manner Reliability, Like other IT applications, AI applications should be developed such Robustness and that will operate reliably over periods of time using the right Security models and datasets while ensuring are both robust i.e. providing consistent results and capable to handle errors, and remain secure against cyberattacks as required by the relevant legal and industry frameworks Fairness The recommendationresult from the AI applications should treat individuals within similar groups in a fair manner, without favouritism or discrimination and without causing or resulting in harm. This entails maintaining respect for the individuals behind the data and refraining from datasets that contain discriminatory biases. Diversity and Inclusion and diverse usership through the AI application should be Inclusion promoted by understanding and respect the interests of all stakeholders impacted. Human Oversight The degree of human intervention required as part of AT application  decisionmaking or operations should be dictated by the level of the perceived severity of ethical issues. Lawfulness and Organisations responsible for an AI application should always act in Compliance accordance with the law and regulations and relevant regulatory regimes.  They Hong Kong they long they using  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Principle Definition Data Privacy Individuals should have the right to a be informed of the purpose of collection and potential transferees of their personal data and that personal data shall only be collected for a lawful purpose, by using lawful and fair means, and that the amount of personal data collected shouldnot be excessive in relation to the purpose.

Guidance on the Ethical Development and Use of Artificial intelligence published by PCPD Embed standards or Organisations should address relevant standards related to data regulations with ethics and A from an operational perspective by embedding strategy these in the organisation strategy and ensuring requirements from standards and regulations are considered and fulfilled in AI projects. A good standard or regulatory compliance strategy should take a topdown approach For example, the CIOs, who are responsible for overseeing ICT development in their organisations, and the PSC, should set clear expectations on standards that the Project Team should comply e.g PDPO with when executing AI projects and emphasise the impact of being incompliant This is to ascertain that the Project Team understands the importance of industry standards and regulations Example An AI Application Impact Assessment can be used to assure standards and regulations are considered The AI Assessment will assist organisations to develop and deploy Al applications ethically because the assessment questions will allow organisations to assess their compliance towards all the Ethical A Principles outlined. Related Ethical AI Principles . Accountability Standards and regulations should necessitate organisations and individuals to be accountable.  Data Privacy To ensure personal data are collected on a fully informed basis and in fair manner, with due considerations towards minimising the amount of data collected, the PDPO and related Data Protection Principles are required to comply with This includes ensuring that the use of personal data in AI shall be the same as or directly related to the original collection purpose of the personal data  Kong Hong being  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE  Lawfulness and Compliance Ensuring industry standards and regulations are considered in the project so that the organisation and AL application users are aware and can comply with .. Project Planning ... Portfolio Management Definition A portfolio is defined as a collection of projects. Portfolio management is performed to ensure that the individual IT investments embedded in the organisation 's processes, people and technology are on course Who are involved at this stage? IT PlannersExecutives, Business Users Practices and examples Practice Practice detail Create an inventory An AI projects inventory of existing, potential and Proof of of existing AI Concepts POC  planned by the organisation should be projects created. A POC is an experimental activity intended to demonstrate the feasibility, benefits and risk that the AI may introduce for evaluation of the appropriateness of the solution towards the real world problem. As such, a POC is usually a smaller scale activity served as a test example to support the case for a larger project. AI projects to Categorise the AI projects based on the status of each project and the organisation determine whether these projects support the current objectives organisation's strategy and objectives. Select and prioritise Organisations should prioritise AT projects that have a favourable AI projects balance of risks and benefits, that bring positive impacts, high probability ofsuccess and should assist the organisation to achieve its objectives. The AI Application Impact Assessment in Section  SAI Assessment can assist organisations to document and determine which Al projects to prioritise. Identify whether some existing IT projects can be combined o enhanced through the adoption of big data and AI and subsequently merit implemented for the benefit of the organisation and end users. Define the intended scope of the AI project This is important to identify and choose a suitable AI application that would fit the intended scope.  being Map being  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Example Tmplementing an AT application such as a chatbot 0n websites could be mapped to an organisation' objective to improve services Organisations should map each Al project to its objective and subsequently select the AI project to prioritise. Organisations can prioritise AI projects that will benefit themselves and end users to adhere to the Beneficial Al principle Related Ethical AI Principles . Beneficial AI Projects that promote common can be prioritised with higher priority  Fairness Potential impacts 0n groups can be factored in at project level based on project 3 Diversity and Inclusion Stakeholders impacted can be mapped across the range of AI projects performed. ... Project Oversight and Delivery Approach Definition It is important to decide whether an Al project will need a review from the IT BoardCIO at the outset of the project Each project has its characteristics and features as well as business values. Roles and responsibilities are required to operationalise Al and ensure accountability. Please refer to Section .. AI Governance for details. The Project Manager should define the quality standard, quality control and assurance activities and the acceptance criteria for major deliverables of the project in the Quality Management Plan. Quality control not oly monitors the quality of deliverables, but it also involves monitoring various aspects of the project as defined in the Project Management Plan PMP to ensure that the AL application complies with the quality standards throughout the AI Lifecycle e.g AI and data ethics, quality procedures, industry standards and government regulations. Who are involved at this stage?

This means the AI application is highly capable of accomplishing tasks and interacting with its surrounding objects or humans. The AI application is used in a complex environment. This means that many variables from the environment are considered throughout the execution of the AI application. For example, the AI application in an open environment such as a public park where moving surrounding objects and other living things have to be factored in by the Al applications Sensitive personal data are used in the AI application This includes any information that could be used to relate and identify a living person Examples of personal data with high sensitivity include identity card numbers, bank account data and health data. Personal data are processed on a large scale andor are combined data sets taking into account The number of individuals concerned, either as a specific number Or as a proportion of the relevant population The volume of data andor the range of different data items being processed The duration, or permanence, of the data processing activity and The geographical extent of the processing activity. The AI application can result in a potentially sensitive impact on human beings e.g to make decisions about individuals or determine their emotions. The AI application involves the evaluation or scoring of individuals This can be done by profiling and predicting a living person, based on aspects such as the data subject' performance at work economic situation health personal preference, reliability, behaviour and location The AI application makes automated decisionscomplex decisions that have a significant impact 0n persons or entities that have legal consequences for them where the decisions were independently made without human intervention The AI application involves systemic observation Or monitoring This is a means of processing used to observe, monitor or control individuals, including data collected through networks or of a monitoring system in a publicly accessible area Perform Quality Quality assurance activities include reviewing and performing Control ongoing monitoring based o the lines of defence model of the AI governance. Please refer to Section .. AI Governance of this document for the AI governance model. Organisations should evaluate whether the AI governance structure and processes are consistent with the changing AI requirements periodically. For example, a new AI technology may require the development of new roles or skills. Protocols, processes and  being using  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practice Practice detail procedures should be established to manage and ensure proper data governance throughout the AI project with existing data governance processes and procedures observed where available. Consider all Ethical This document provides endtoend practices throughout the AI AI Principles Lifecycle to consider throughout the AI The Ethical AI Framework should be leveraged to consider the Lifecycle ethical impacts with reference to the Ethical Al Principles and document related considerations in the AI Application Impact Assessment questionnaire. Please refer to Section  SAI Assessment for details. Ensure that the project plan considers ethics over development and implementation of AI e.g creating requirements for fairness in the proposed AL model and listing the methods in place to measure and test for achieving this Please refer to Section ...

Technology Roadmap for Al and Data Usage Definition technology roadmap should enable the organisations to plan and strategise which, when and what technologies will be procured for Al and big data analytics. An effective technology roadmap should outline a strategy to achieve the digital transformation Who are involved at this stage? IT PlannersExecutives, Data Scientists, IT Security Management, System Analysts, System Architects, Business Users  goals. being goals  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practices and examples Practice Practice detail Establish Organisations should check with their IT teams or equivalent appropriate when choosing an infrastructure that fits the organisation  technology objectives, compliance needs and budget This includes the use of existing infrastructure that may be available centrally in the organisation such as a centralised data analytics platform Organisations should check with their IT teams or equivalent when considering a suitable scalable technical infrastructure required for data collection and storage, data processing, data modelling, execution and deployment. This is to ensure that the solution can scale and have resources to use and process the data required As the number of requests and data increases, the technical infrastructure should be able to respond automatically to maintain the speed and reliability. All AI and big data applications should be built with scalability and availability in mind. Conduct data Organisations can assess what data are needed for the project and assessments whether relevant data will be available for the project Availability and quality of relevant data are the prerequisites for any AI application as are required to power the AI application for training Or sampling the Al model within the Al application and to make predictions. Organisations should identify the specific types of data and sources of data that will be collected tracked, transferred, used, stored or processed as part of the Al application and whether the data involved are sensitive. Organisations should document the data lineage to understand the source, path, license or other obligations and transformations of data which would be utilised in the Al application Example The use of video analytics can be from recorded footage o a live camera. It is important to define how and what data are collected, stored and processed e.g biometric information as of data assessments This is to help adherence to the Data Privacy principle during the entire data life stages from data collection to data disposal. Related Ethical AI Principles . Reliability, Robustness and Security The security of technology leveraged is required to ensure that AI applications are secure.  Sustainability and Just Transition Technology used should be scalable and have mitigation for failure which could impact Al applications.  they part cycle  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE ... Procuring AI Services Sourcing Definition AI projects can be conducted through outsourcing arrangements Offtheshelf products O even external data can be procured for AI projects. In conducting such procurement exercises, organisations should duly consider the related ethical considerations. Who are involved at this stage? Sourcing Team i.e. Procurement , Project Manager Business Users Practices and examples Practice Practice detail Define requirements Plan forAI Procurement of the AI application Organisations should evaluate that they have the right sourcing for procurement team procurement and Project Team with diverse expertise for opinions For example, the Project Team can have different expertise including domain experts, system and data engineering experts and security experts. This would ensure that the right vendor with the right technology and skillsets requirements is chosen. Organisations should allocate the right expertise to perform the change management delivery, training and handover upon procurement of the AI application. Training and education can be provided to IT to enhance capabilities This will ensure that all relevant staff are equipped with the skills and knowledge that they should have to take on the and responsibility for AI including understanding the probabilistic nature of AI algorithms Organisations may consider suitably including the requirements on the experience of the tenderers andlor the personnel engaged by the tenderers in Al development in the brief or specifications for procuring Al applications. Organisations should define a clear problem statement on the objectives of the AI application. Requirements for services can include consideration of model and ethical risks, importance to business objectives O strategy and model interpretability as appropriate. Understand Thirdparty's Approach  goals  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practice Practice detail As AI systems involve typically complex algorithms and modelling techniques, organisations should pay extra attention when outsourcing the implementation of AI projects. Organisations should request and review the documentation including the algorithm's design specification, coding and techniques the AI application is based 0n, its outcomes, ongoing support and monitoring or maintenance of the proposed AI application Areas to be checked when using third parties include Operation and intended use Training procedures Testing procedures Performance metrics Checks performed to evaluate ethical values such as fairness reliability, robustness and security Access to model configuration and Potential vulnerabilities, risks or biases in the AI application. Ensure Thirdparty's Compliance with Existing Standards The Project Team should observe that the AI vendor is compliant with local and international standards where available and applicable. Regulatory requirements surrounding AI have to be developed around the world today. Development for standards of AI is ongoing at the international standards body or professional associations such as the ISO and IEEE which can be referenced in the future. There are currently existing standards specific to medical devices with machine learning capabilities such as China Centre for Medical Device' s Technical Guiding Principles of RealWorld Data for Clinical Evaluation of Medical Devices  United States Food and Drug Administration's Proposed Regulatory Framework for Modifications to Artificial IntelligenceMachine Learning AIMMLBased Software as a Medical Device SaMD  ISO standards such as ISO . The International Electrotechnical Commission TEC  standards such as IEC .

Emphasise the need for interpretability and request documentation on this e.g algorithms specification, coding and techniques the AI model is based on and its outcomes  for review of the AI models within AI applications. Doing so will enable the organisations to engage with other vendors in the future to continue or enhance the initial AI application rather than being locked into one vendor Where vendors will not release documentation on AI algorithms due to trade secrets in practice, there can be a business decision for the organisation to take on where the risk of such non disclosure should be considered with the possible business consequences. Organisations using their individual project governance bodies  would consider case by case with their own justifications, considerations and decision documented Ensure the data models and data formats for the AI application are usable across a variety of platforms, rather than formats that are specific to a given vendor where possible. This can be checked with the individual vendors. Agree on Intellectual Property Some thirdparty vendors may not disclose the algorithm and technique used in the development of the AI application to protect their intellectual property IP rights. When the third party vendor designs and develops a new Al application for the use of organisation, the new intellectual property owner should be mutually in line with organisation procurement procedures. Organisation should agree with the thirdparty AI provider on who should be the controller of the AI application and the data being processed by the AI solution upon procurement of the solution. In such cases, this should be explicitly stated and stipulated in a contract or service level agreement.  e.g design agreed  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practice Practice detail Perform risk The credibility and reliability of the thirdparty provider mitigation indirectly affect the reliability and robustness of the AI procedures application Conduct an independent evaluation of the thirdparty provider as part of a due diligence process. This to custom AI applications as well as offtheshelf or turnkey Al applications This can include basic company information checks such as business license, official references, global sanctions law enforcement past experiencescredentials and qualifications Where these checks are not passed there can be business decision for the organisation to take on where the risk of reliability of the vendor should be considered with the possible business consequences. Organisations using their individual project governance bodies should consider this on a case by case basis with their own justifications, considerations and decision documented. Organisations can maintain documented processes for dealing with third parties and evidence their due diligence completed This includes maintaining evidence of documentation obtained and reviewed related to the thirdparty provider Risk considerations such as any thirdparty interactions with the AI application, access to model configuration files or endpoints, access to the models and how are used should all be considered and documented Example When procuring video analytics solution, organisations need to understand the thirdparty' S approach Including requirements in the tender that the contractor should comply with related security standards and ensure the proposed design takes into consideration security issues such as the use of masking, anonymising and maintaining compliance to data privacy standards assists with adherence to the Data Privacy' principle.

Who are involved at this stage? Project Managers, Business Users Practices and examples Practice Practice detail Define business A process such as the AI Application Impact Assessment, please requirements refer to Section  AI Assessment? for details is defined and should be followed through to ensure the potential application impact and the data usage is considered alongside Ethical AI Principles, strategy and any applicable legal requirements. A standard process exists to define and validate the performance and business success criteria for a given AL project and application. Examples of these criteria include measuring performance metrics such as true positive rates o false negative rates or false positive rates for classification models. High true positive rates can indicate that the Al application performs as intended and provides results with high accuracy whereas high false positive rates denote that negative cases are incorrectly predicted as positive and the Al application may require further finetuning to produce accurate results High false negative rates denote that positive cases are not correctly included in the prediction result Given there is no single set of metrics that can fit all AI applications given higher false negative rates may trigger a lower false positive rate and vice versa, this definition should be tailored by Project Team for individual Al application Organisations should engage both internal and external stakeholders to determine the functional requirements, non functional requirements and quality assurance procedures needed for the AI application Organisations should consider potential alternatives to the current or proposed Al applications and check the performance compared to the AI application in terms of accuracy metrics and any business, legal, economic Or social impacts For example, is the alternative method more accurate and economical from an operational perspective than an AI application? Should the model minimise false negative or false positive? This would assist the organisation to gauge whether the alternative method would impose less risk than an Al application comparing to the benefits of the proposed Al application   ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practice Practice detail The overall AI application development process should include an iterative impact assessment please refer to AI Application Impact Assessment in Section  AI Assessment that includes testing requirements and ensures that the Al project is aligned with the organisations approach to overall risk management for example, alignment with all internal policies and Ethical AI Principles. Related Ethical AI Principles . Cooperation and Openness organisations should engage both internal and external stakeholders to determine the functional requirements, nonfunctional requirements quality assurance procedures needed for the Al application ... Solution Design Definition When developing Al applications, organisations should determine the design requirements. This includes assessing various aspects such as the suitability of data and technology and the degree of human intervention required Riskier decisions should incorporate a higher level of human intervention in the process. Who are involved at this stage? Project Managers, Business Users Practices and examples Practice Practice detail Assess AI model s An A model within an AI application should be assessed for suitability suitability compared to the organisation' objectives There should be a process in place to produce reasons for the decisions or recommendations that an AI model reaches when required Factors affecting the decisionmaking of the model can include the business objective accuracy and interpretability of the model model development and training time scalability of the model complexity of the model and  and  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practice Practice detail IT architecture or infrastructure. A process should be in place to assure that a systematic review is conducted to determine the suitability of organisation  existing technology architecture for the Al model's design To identify suitability, the following activities should be performed Understand the datasets consumed by AI models Certain AI models can only operate with certain types of data some algorithms can function with smaller datasets while others do not. For example, Naive Bayes o linear regression algorithms may perform well for small datasets. If the training dataset is large, it may be more suitable to consider decision tree algorithms  A sufficient amount of 'training data should be allocated to finetune the reliability of an AI model to satisfactory level. Refer to section ... Data Extraction for details on the portion of training data compared to testing data and validation data. Identify the types of learning algorithm required which can be categorised as Supervised learning  Ifthe training dataset has an input and a corresponding output pair, then a supervised learning algorithm should be applied. Supervised learning is the process of training AL models using training datasets that contain an input and a correct output which allow the model to learn. Examples of supervised learning algorithms are regression and anomaly detection. Unsupervised learning  Ifthe dataset does not have any corresponding output pair, then an unsupervised learning algorithm should be used. Unsupervised learning is a learning algorithm that will attempt to identify the pattern and hidden structures within the data. Examples ofunsupervised learning algorithms are clustering and dimension reduction Reinforcement learning Reinforcement learning is a reward and punishment mechanism used to train AI models where the reward function determines the rewards for the actions of the Al model and vice versa. The reward function allows the Al application to derive conclusions by learning from experience instead of making a prediction Reinforcement learning may not be applicable for certain AI applications This  www kdnuggetscomguidechooserightmachinelearningalgorithm html  being using pair  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practice Practice detail reinforcement Tearning technique can train the AI model to respond based on existing reward information Understand the constraints Several constraints to be understood include the scalability of the Al model, storage capacity and model development time. Determine the As part of completing an AI Application Impact Assessment appropriate level of evaluate whether the Al application requires human intervention human intervention Apart from the severity of impact to individuals  organisations as a result of the decisions to be made by the AI applications, organisations should consider factors such as Probability of the AI Application causing harm or affecting human safety during the decisionmaking process. The operational cost of executing the decision making with human intervention in comparison to executing it without human intervention. Legal implications or similar effects for automated decisions when there is no human' involvement in the decision making, Evolving societal norms and values. Considerations should include whether it would be generally acceptable to society when the decisionmaking process is fully automated by an AI application. Organisations should determine the level of human intervention required from the AI application In general, there are three different approaches when determining the appropriate level of human intervention These are humanoutoftheloop humanintheloop and humanincommand' . Humaninthe loop  and humanincommand' approaches can be considered assisted intelligence or augmented intelligence while humanout oftheloop can be considered automated intelligence or autonomous intelligence. The extent of human intervention should be proportionate to the impact level associated with the AI application. A higher impact would have a higher level of human intervention expected. . Consider a humanoutoftheloop approach in decision making when decisions being made do not have a significant impact on the economy, society, law or when it is impractical to involve human beings in the process. Impact assessment can be performed using the AI Application Impact Assessment. As an example, a humanoutoftheloop approach would be suitable when swift decisions are required within a limited timeframe and there is limited impact. It is  key  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practice Practice detail still crucial that the AI application' s decision is interpretable by human beings even when the decision making itself will not involve human  Consider a humanintheloop approach when there is limited data available and humans are able to make a better judgement 3 Consider a humanincommand when the humanintheloop or humanoutoftheloop approach is not suitable. This allows human beings to oversee and control the overall activity of the AI application with the ability to decide when and how to intervene. This approach can enable human beings to adjust variables that may alter the outcome or decision making of the AI application Identify the automated decisions that the AI application is required to perform. When the Al automates decisions that have legal implications or similar effects, and there is no human intervention in the decision, processes should be introduced to ensure the individuals affected have been informed Users should be made aware of their interactions with the AI application upfront This is to increase transparency to users and ensure that user consent has been obtained for example, provide a disclosure that states the automated decisions are solely performed by the Al application and users should only proceed if they agree with such usage. Define requirements Create a communications plan o AI model interpretability to for transparency and achieve transparency and interpretability to impacted interpretability of AI stakeholders for exhibiting the relative importance of each models variable to explain predictions. Provide examples to explain the AI decisionmaking process in narrative terms O graphics for example, drawing a workflow with decision trees whenever possible for nontechnical audience to understand and visualise the AI operations better Organisations should make explicit how different factors and data determine the outcomes and conclusions oftheir Almodels. The reasoning that is usually acceptable from a human point of view can include aspects such as logic societal norm, practices and beliefs and moral justifications. Example It is important to determine the level of appropriate human involvement for adherence to the Human Oversight principle. Humanintheloop is often used for the automation of security threat detection for computer systems The changing threat landscape in  beings.  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practice Practice detail today' s cybersecurity leads to new forms of attack which are not detected by AI applications security specialist would still be required to perform security threat detection alongside the Al application and to check the accuracy of the results from the Al application Predictive railway maintenance that triggers work orders O orders maintenance parts can adopt humanoutoftheloop approaches although this may be limited to a notification, prioritisation and order placement as the maintenance itself may still require inperson involvement. humanincommand approach should be adopted in Situations when broader economic, societal, legal or ethical impacts are involved for example, medical operations. Related Ethical AI Principles . Human Oversight Ensure an appropriate level of human intervention based on multiple factors such as the benefits and risks of the Al application, impacts of the Al decision, operational cost and evolving societal norms and values  Accountability Ensure that there is accountability for high risks Al applications including having human beings involved when decisions are made. ... Data Extraction Definition Al models rely on information from various sources, within O outside of the organisations, which can possess high risks associated with data quality, validity, reliability and consistency. An Extract, Transform and Load ETL  tool is typically used to extract huge volumes of data from various sources and to transform and load the data based on the Almodel's needs. Complex data cleansing and transformation steps can be prone to unintended user errors that are difficult to identify and may lead to erroneous modelling results Data integrity is a necessary component to ensure data fairness. Data integrity ensures that the results generated from the AI application are not generated by biased or skewed datasets Who are involved at this stage? System Analysts, System Architects  being  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practices and examples Practice Practice detail Use or establish a Utilise the central data repositories in organisations as a common centralised data registry for AI applications where appropriate. The standardised data repository should have access controls in place that are regularly layer maintained. Leverage data repositories such as data warehouses, data lakes or data marts to act as a 'single source of truth' The data repository can then be used to provide a cleansed data source for the AI application development Perform data Validate consistency of data formats when data are obtained validation from multiple sources. Perform evaluations to ensure data quality and characteristics align with the business and AI application objectives Some common examples of data validation rules include validating data types or formats, unique key checks, duplicate data checks, consistency of acronyms and preventing null values Identify whether personal information exists in the dataset and complies with data usage policies for personal data instituted by regulators Obtain assurance for Verify reliability, representativeness and relevance of the data public 0r thirdparty acquired. An example of confirming data reliability is verifying data the information obtained against its source. Further verification can be performed if an independent reliable data source exists. Examine the content of the source data and determine ifit fits the needs of the Al model by identifying its relevance to the objectives and whether it addresses the subject matter Assess the reliability level of the vendor andor institutions of the data source Please refer to Section ... Procuring AI Services for details. Data reliability is often contextual eg how critical is the decision that the data needed is to be relied on. An example would be the difference between the data used in a simple marketing application with limited impact compared to the data used to decide who can't get on a plane. The data for the latter case would be expected to typically be much more reliable than a simple marketing application  project  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practice Practice detail Complete There should be a standard requirement or process to define and documentation on document the specific types of data which will be collected, data sources tracked, transferred, used, stored or processed as of AI model and application development Tracking and maintaining information on the data source, owner licenses and assumptions records should be performed as a data governance practice. System analysts and architects are responsible for governing the collection or acquisition of all sources of training, testing and operational data related to the AI model Enhance Ensure ETL processes are transparent through scripting by transparency and documenting O using a workflow approach that visualises data traceability lineage for the organisation, System Analysts and System Architects to understand the data flow. Enable error handling Develop an error handling mechanism for the ETL solution The mechanism error handling mechanism should capture the ETL s task name, error number and error description. This should then be captured in a separate table or file that enables the Project Team to issues and fix them. For example, an alerting mechanism can be incorporated to alert Project Team members via email when errors in ETL processes occUI. Example For video analytics, to obtain assurance for public Or thirdparty data, ensure that the videos have been obtained from valid source based on the metadata of the video and verify the recording location, recording dateltime, duration, etc. Additional analysis can be done on the video to ensure source validity by identifying whether the human being'  faces have been altered due to adversarial attacks. This would assist adherence to the Reliability, Robustness and Security' principle. For adherence to the Reliability, Robustness and Security' principle, organisations should enable the error handling mechanism An AI model for counting footfall from CCTV should be tested actual video and retested when there are code changes. Data extracted from videos could be broken down into different stages of extraction to identify for errors for example, assess for exclusions of objects at different stages of extraction. Related Ethical AI Principles . Fairness Integrity of data sources is important to help ensure a fair outcome  Reliability, Robustness and Security Data collected should be complete and accurate to ensure the reliability of the data for model training purposes.  Safety, Reliability, Robustness and Security ETL tools must be secure and robust when performing data cleansing and transformation to avoid errors in subsequent stages of development  part key good system e.g analyse using  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE ... Preprocessing Definition In the data processing procedures for AL modelling purposes, the data processed need to be fair and appropriate in terms of data samples, Size and distributions to ensure the AI application formulate meaningful and representative inferences. Representational flaws in datasets such as overrepresentation o underrepresentation of data samples may lead to bias in the outcomes of trained AI models. Sensitive data containing an individual S information requires extra care during solution development to prevent data leakage as well as breaches of privacy and security policies The amount of personal data collected, processed and used should be minimised where feasible. Note For considerations related to the use of personal data and privacy in IT projects including AI or big data projects, organisations should refer to PDPJO guidance Who are involved at this stage? Project Managers, System Analysts, System Architects, Data Scientists Practices and examples Practice Practice detail Conduct Privacy Conduct PIA to identify whether it is necessary to collect the data Impact Assessments type, amount and extent of personal data for use in AI SPIA applications Perform data Use safeguards such as pseudonyms and full anonymisation to anonymisation prevent the connection of the personal data to an identifiable person. Data anonymisation is the process ofprotecting sensitive information via encrypting masking and aggregating any information that links an individual to the stored data. Reaffirm that the benefits of keeping anonymised data outweigh the potential risk that such data are used to identify individuals, and the impact that such deidentification could have on the individuals. For this reason, the Project Team should review regularly whether anonymised data can be reidentified and adopt appropriate measures to protect personal data. similar analysis on benefits and risks should be applied to assess the loss of data utility if the data are being deidentified. For example, blurring faces in video analytics is a form of data anonymisation performed to reduce class bias and protect the identities of the individuals. When data anonymisation is performed, document the process to achieve this as part of the logging procedures.   ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practice Practice detail Perform data In situations where the anonymisation of data is not feasible O minimisation and required, organisations should minimise the personal data that an aggregation AI application has access to. Organisations should identify if there are any less dataintensive methods to achieve the of the activity. Data minimisation involves identifying the minimum amount of data needed to fulfil the purpose and objective of the AI application. Project Teams can achieve minimised data by ensuring the data collected is sufficient to meet the objective relevant and has a rational connection to achieve the objective and limited to only what is required. For example, data aggregation, a process of collating and summarising the data can be performed to reduce the level of detail if it is not required Create a single Process and analyse sensitive data in one secure work area within analytical data the same server or cloud environment where the data was environment collected to avoid the risk of leakage when transferring the data Additionally, the organisation should avoid adhoc insecure environments where possible to ensure proper handling of data is maintained throughout the project lifecycle. Implement and adhere to retention policies for all data eg personal data and video data collected. Identify outliers and Detect outliers in the source dataset and in the final modelling anomalies datasets by plotting the data in the form of graphs such as box plots, scatter plots or histograms Outliers and anomalies can be defined as data points in the dataset being some distance away from the mean of the dataset'  population. If the detected outliers and anomalies in the dataset involve errors or do not represent the population accurately, should be removed or patched with reasonable values if do not represent the entire population accurately This is because, in supervised learning AI models, outliers and anomalies can be deceiving, resulting in prolonged training times, or leading to less precise AI models. When the datasets contain a large number of variables, identifying and removing outliers can be challenging In such cases, automatic outlier detection algorithms can be used in the modelling pipeline. Examples of automatic outlier detection  goals using they they  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practice Practice detail algorithms are isolation forest, minimum covariance determinant and local outlier factor Define and test for Fairness can be understood from the perspective of groups, fairness and bias individuals or thirdparty agents. Organisation should define fairness in the context of their AI application to be able to test for bias and fairness. As an example, facial recognition system should display statistical equal parity in order to classify people from different races accurately. Examples of mathematical fairness definitions are as follows . Statistical Equal Parity Positive classification rates across both groups should be equal.  Equal Opportunity Mathematically, it implies True Positive Rates across all groups should be equal  Overall Accuracy Equality Both groups should give similar accuracy measures for the given model  Gini Equality Gini is defined as the ratio area between the Receiver Operating Characteristic ROC  curve and the diagonal line as well as the area of a related triangle. In essence, the model should do an equally task of classifying 's as 's and 's as 's across all groups. Bias can encroach upon an AI application when bias exists in data being used to train the AI model. Organisations can mitigate inherent bias using bias detection methods to evaluate whether the model discriminates against various groups O individuals, given a testdataset. Examples ofbias detection methods include Comparing performance metrics Analyse performance of the AI model across groups, by calculating different rates of correct and incorrect predictions Different performance metrics such as true positive rate, false positive rate, true negative rate or false negative rate for each possible group in the dataset are then computed Output such as distribution plots of features can identify skewness across groups. Measuring fairness This can be done by performing comparison analysis for the disadvantaged against advantaged groups based on fairness definitions normalised treatment quality, statistical parity, etc. Bar charts and heat maps are examples of outputs that could capture disparities across groups. Detecting proxies This can be done by calculating mutual information of all features with different sensitive attributes e.g age, gender and race to understand how might act as proxies. Fix unbalanced class Unbalanced classes are a classification issue that arises when the problems distribution of data across different classes is biased. For example, when implementing an AI for processing applications, adequate amount ofhistorical data on approved and notapproved casesshould be madeavailablefor trainingthe  good they system  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practice Practice detail model. This means that not all the classes or categories in the dataset are represented equally. AI predictive modelling involves predicting a class label for a given observation from the datasets. When an unbalanced class complication appears, this results in AI models that show poor predictive performance, specifically for the classes from minority groups, resulting in class discrimination. Benchmark data distributions against the full dataset population statistics to quantify the representativeness of the data being tested. This can assist in mitigating bias in the data used for model development. For example, use standard algorithms such as random forest logistic regression and decision trees to ensure classification model that can predict classes with limited instances and ensures that training data contains equal data samples from different groups. In the event where unbalanced datasets led to the unbalanced class issue, this could be handled using sampling techniques such as random resampling to rebalance the class distribution for the imbalanced dataset random undersampling to delete dataset examples from the majority class with the intention that the model loses some information to achieve a balanced dataset comparable to the minority class and random oversampling to duplicate dataset examples from the minority class to achieve a balanced dataset comparable to the majority class. Compare training Once the AI model has been tuned to a satisfactory level, a validation and test testing dataset can be used to evaluate the learned models to data gauge the model' performance 0n unseen data. Training data are the sample data used to train the AI model If several models or tuning ofhyperparameters are involved, validation data can be used to evaluate the model fit among different models during model development. Test data can be considered the data that will be held from the AI model for final modelling purpose until the very end of the training stage. The benchmark for the data size is as follows Training data test data validation data are commonly set at .. or .. If validation data are not used, Hyperparameter refers to a parameter which its value is used to control the learning process of a machine learning model. For example the maximum level for a random forest model.  good testing  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practice Practice detail the recommended sample size for training data to test data are .. Analyse and compare both training and validationtest data to ensure the results from what is used to evaluate AI model are equivalent to what was used to build the model. This is to confirm that the outcome of the AI model is comparable when new and unseen test data are used. For example, if the AI model is able to classify an image of a person as a human being based on the training data, it should be able to perform comparably based on the test data even though both images presented are two distinct individuals. Create or use a library containing training and validationtest data which can be utilised to evaluate for potential unintended bias. For example, some Python deep learning libraries?   can be used t0 detect prejudicial or discriminatory correlations between features, labels and groups. Example One example to practice data anonymisation in the case of video analytics is to blur or obscure faces to ensure individuals cannot be identified in the videos when identification is not necessary This is in line with the Data Privacy principle. If the objective of the analytics is to measure footfall, limit the data extraction and storage to the total count Consider blurring of faces at the point of data collection and do not extract information such as the behaviour of individuals and their activities. To adhere to the Fairness principle, organisations can analyse the training data used to assess fair representation. For video analytics to measure footfall, ensure that the AImodel measures footfall correctly for different groups of people. Training data can contain equal data samples from individuals in different groups to ensure different types of individuals are recognised. Training data, when used to measure footfall via CCTV should include various scenarios to ensure the outcome of the model meets the objective correctly Related Ethical AI Principles L.

Model Assumptions Definition Model assumptions are conditions that should be satisfied by the model before performing the relevant modelling analysis. The assumptions underpinning the model must be checked for accurate interpretations and conclusions. Who are involved at this stage? Project Managers, Data Scientists   ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practices and examples Practice Practice detail Perform rigorous Statistical and other data assumptions must be tested during testing development to ensure model predictions and insights are valid. Lack of assumptions review and approval of AI models trained leads to erroneous or risky assumptions The Project Team should conduct testing and document the results of the testing to verify the AI model' s assumptions. Examples of testing include algorithm testing and regression testing Lack of documentation or logging of model results and configurations can make it difficult to manage Or maintain AI assets in subsequent stages The should contain information such as Jobsoperations performed by the AL application including the algorithms executed and Decisions made and outcomes. Monitor the decisions made by AI through the and compare them to human decisions Or real outcomes and document the action taken When there is a need to retrain the model for example, when accuracy levels are too low, include a thorough justification for the change and the features affected Example Organisations should perform rigorous testing to assess model predictions and insights. This is to check that Fairness principle is being followed for accuracy. In the case of weather prediction model, the data may oly be applicable for certain locations and therefore not as practical for predicting the weather in different locations. The location assumed in the data should be checked. Related Ethical AI Principles . Fairness To achieve fairness in the outcomes, all data assumptions should be tested and verified for accuracy.

The Project Team should incorporate downside risk measures in machine learning objective functions to operate more conservatively to avoid situations in which the AI makes disastrous decisions. For example, if the Almodel does not meet the success criteria, other measures should be performed by the AL model that can include escalating to a human operator O aborting the decisionmaking process Example Reinforcement learning can be used for autonomous vehicles. For example, when AL moves the vehicles in a certain direction, the pattern of the traffic surrounding the vehicles can be used as a reward function i.e. if the surrounding vehicles are greater than a specified distance away from the autonomous vehicle itself and in line with the highway it is more likely that the decisions being made by the AI are correct. Scenarios should be checked to ensure that traffic patterns recognised are safe for others This adheres to the Reliability, Robustness and Security' principle. Related Ethical AI Principles . Reliability, Robustness and Security Rewards functions in A can reinforce learning models, leading to more reliable and robust AI models. .... Input Variable Selection Definition Input variables or features are values within datasets that are loaded into an Al application for the purpose of training the Al model. A robust AL model relies on these informative inputs to provide an output often referred to as target variable i.e. what the AI model is trying to predict Selections of input variables should consider both organisation knowledge and causal relationships.

Avoid target variable The Project Team should avoid target variable leakage which is leakage where information that should be beyond the training dataset is used to create the AI model. Target variable leakage arises when the AI model is being trained based on a dataset that includes information that would not normally be available at the time of prediction This future information can make the AI model s results appear more accurate than the model performance would be in real situations. Timeseries data ifused should be evaluated if data are not used where the data occurred after the case predicted by the AI model. A cutoff value on time can be useful to prevent obtaining information after the time of prediction Features that are highly correlated with the input variable should be assessed to ensure are not a result of future information as these features are more likely to be the target variable leakage ifit is occurring. Example Organisations should aim to avoid target variable leakage to adhere to the Fairness' principle. When AI is used in medical diagnosis to detect disease, the training dataset should be limited to data that would be available at the time of prediction If it has data such as future surgery used, this may indicate that the real results of the model are not as as expected. Related Ethical AI Principles . Fairness Data used in AI models should be obtained fairly. 2 Reliability, Robustness and Security To operate reliably and as expected, avoiding target variable leakage means that test results for predictions are more likely to mirror accuracy levels of real predictions.  prior being they good  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE .... Model Overfitting Definition Overfitting is a modelling error that emerges when an Al model is trained to closely fit a limited set of data points. An overfitting model will often exhibit high accuracy on the training dataset but low accuracy on new data. If the Al model does not generalise well from the training data to new or unseen data, the AI model may perform poorly in its prediction. Who are involved at this stage? Data Scientists Practices and examples Practice Practice detail Perform cross  Crossvalidation is a resampling procedure that would be validation performed by a development team to evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy ofan Al model based on a limited data sample. One example of a resampling procedure is the kfold technique. The Kfold technique allows training and testing of the Amodel ktimes on different subsets of training data to derive a more accurate estimate of the model S prediction performance Every resampled dataset should have a similar distribution as the full population's distribution for this approach to be acceptable. For example, if the full population consists of  distinct categories, the resampled dataset should have a comparable number of distinct categories This is because missing categories during the crossvalidation process can lead to bias in the AI model's outcome. Perform Consider the use of regularisation. Regularisation is the process regularisation and to normalise and bring uniformity to Al models Regularisation other forms of model is often a technique used in machine learning to finetune the Al selection model function by discouraging the learning of additional and unnecessary complex models. This can reduce the risk of overfitting An example of a regularisation technique is pruning This can be used to remove features that are the least important for the model to learn from. AI models can learn not oly basic features of provided datasets but also noise as well as fluctuations that place importance on unimportant features and hence pruning can help. Examples of unimportant features can include backgrounds in an image containing the actual object being detected.   ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practice Practice detail Example To avoid overfitting in the case of medical diagnosis, crossvalidation can be performed. AI models can be further evaluated by splitting sample data by specific medical conditions and reevaluating the model's diagnosis Another method to avoid overfitting is reducing factors unrelated to the condition e.g social background or location in some cases to reduce the complexity of the AI model. Such practices would assist organisations to adhere to the Reliability, Robustness and Security principle. Related Ethical AI Principles . Reliability, Robustness and Security Overfitting should be avoided to ensure outcomes from AI models when used on unseen data are reliable and accurate. .... Model Training Ownership Definition Al models where the training process is partially or fully outsourced to the public cloud Or relies on thirdparty pretrained models can introduce new security risks. Please note that if the Al model training process is not outsourced, the practices and examples in this subsection are not applicable. Who are involved at this stage? Sourcing Team i.e. Procurement.   ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practices and examples Practice Practice detail Use trusted The process of training an AI model involves providing the AI cloudthirdparty model with training data to learn from. Precise training data are services required to help AI models to understand patterns to derive conclusion thirdparty vendor used to train an Al model or to provide a cloud training environment for the organisation should be subject to the thirdparty procurement process. This helps lower the risk of receiving tampered model that may feature a backdoor. Please refer to Section ... Procuring AI Services for details on thirdparty procurement process. Organisations should assess the suitability of storing and using personal data o data belonging to organisations on the public cloud. The trained model should be transferred only through channels that provide surety of integrity in transit Examples include docker containers and pickle files for python scripts which can then be encrypted before being transferred.

Reliability, Robustness and Security Thirdparty'  compliance with relevant international standards increases the likelihood that their Al applications remain reliable, robust and secure. .... Adversarial Attacks Definition An adversarial attack takes place when malicious actors deceive the AL models to intentionally influence the AI application S outputs without detected This is attempted by modifying the input data to induce the Al model to make an incorrect prediction. Such attacks can occur in the training phase O the test phase. Attacks that appear during the training phase are known as poisoning attacks whereas attacks that exist in the test phase can be identified as evasion attacks Who are involved at this stage? Data Scientists, Project Managers  Any being  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practices and examples Practice Practice detail Perform adversarial The Project Team should obtain as many adversarial examples training as possible and explicitly train the model not to be misled by these samples. Adversarial training involves enlarging the dataset to include adversarial examples from which the AI models can learn from. Adversarial training is introduced to secure the AI application from disruptive perturbations at different points of vulnerability in an AI model. Disruptive perturbations happen when a small random value is added to existing data points in training data that alter the original features of the data Such examples can often be seen in digital images where random values are added to the original image which results in the wrong classification by the Al model e.g an image ofapanda is classified as gibbon due to disruptive perturbations. Build a new adversarial machine learning model that predicts whether a dataset is from a recent dataset or from the AI training dataset This could be a method to identify new changing data, leading to new forms of adversarial attacks that would require retraining of the AI model For example, there are opensource libraries written in Python programming language such as the Adversarial Robustness Toolbox2 that can be used to train A models against adversarial attacks. Perform dimension Use dimensionality reduction on the training data to enhance the reduction resilience of a classifier as a defence mechanism against evasion attacks. This means there are fewer data dimensions that can be used to falsify data. Dimensionality reduction refers to techniques that reduce the attributes of the data but still retain the meaningful properties of the original data. As an example, personal data attributes can include age, height weight and race. Checking the missing values ratio is a method to reduce the dimensionality in data. Data fields with numerous empty O null values are less likely to carry useful information. Therefore, data fields with the number of empty values greater than a certain threshold could be removed. The higher the threshold set the more data reduction will be performed. Example Adversarial training .e. training model using adversarial examples to defense against adversarial attacks is often required for adherence to the principle of Reliability, Robustness and Security' To mitigate adversarial attacks, someone may use standard  WWWibm combblogs rescarchaiadversarialrobustnesstoolbox   ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practice Practice detail adversarial library e.g CleverHans to train the AI model for adversarial image data. Alternatively, in an Al model for diagnosis that uses images, these images may be compressed. When the dimension of the images is reduced, whilst this leads to reduction in image precision, it is harder for an attacker to manipulate the pixel values of medical images due to smaller resolutions. Please note that any libraries used should be subject to evaluation and approval before use in line with other IT programs Related Ethical AI Principles .

This includes assessing the AI application ' S suitability for the objective of the organisation and that there is a process in place to produce reasons for the decisions or recommendations from the AL application when requested Enable edge cases The Project Team should consider using cases to train the and exception AI model on how it should respond when encountering handling cases. Edge cases typically occur when an AI application encounters unexpected scenarios where it may not perform as expected. AI models should be developed and incorporated to handle unseen data, new use cases and potential malicious inputs. As an example of edge cases, when AI to measure footfall from videos, different examples should be verified e.g when a person is using an object such as a bike or a person is wearing a mask. Precautions should be taken to ensure that these situations are handled correctly Estimate the impact of your AI application when it provides inaccurate results and identify ways to minimise it For example, if the AI application produces erroneous results, what is the likelihood that it causes harm to users? Increased human intervention can support to minimise the impact of the erroneous results. Example Integration, system decision and UAT should be performed with different end users and Project Team members to deployment to further the principle of Cooperation and  and prior edge edge using prior  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practice Practice detail Openness with adequate checkandbalance controls. When deploying a weather forecasting AI application, this application should be tested by a human forecaster to ensure that the output of the AI application is valid. The AI application should be evaluated for its functional requirements including weather prediction and nonfunctional requirements such as performance and usability. Related Ethical AI Principles . Interpretability Project Team can explain the decisions of the Al application and factors that affect these decision outcomes during testing 2 Reliability, Robustness and Security  AI applications should be tested for integration, user acceptance and handling of errors to ensure reliability and robustness. 3 Cooperation and Openness Project Managers can work together with the Project Team aS well as endusers to perform testing before deployment ... Transition and Execution Definition Assuming the AI application would fail, mitigation steps should be incorporated to minimise damages in the case of failure. Who are involved at this stage? Data Scientists, Project Managers   ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practices and examples Practice Practice detail Establish multiple Multiple layers of mitigation in code can be established to layers of mitigation system errors or failures at different levels or modules of the AI application. This can assist in earlier detection of errors to stop these errors affecting other parts of the Al application For high risk AL applications, drills should be performed to ensure that everyone is conscious of procedures to handle different stop system errors or failures appropriately. The Project Team should incorporate defense or controls at the beginning or end of each solution step to prevent flowon effects that could cause a significant system failure. For example, when data are preprocessed, the processing could when there are errors and a warning to users Consider controls in place that allow for human intervention or autoshutdown in the event of system failure and create a business continuity plan to address such undesirable events. The plan should include the response and recovery methods in the event of system failure. Organisations should also consider the business continuity plan, which identifies what are the processes to be taken when the model fails, needs to be taken offline, or decommissioned. The decommissioning could be because the model no longer works, is no longer relevant or a newer and better system has been created to take its place. The business continuity plan ensures there is no impact on a process or function during the transition process. For some systems, this may include a parallel run while a new system is coming online before the old Al application is taken offline. Apply business rules Organisations should implement business rules for quality assurance. For example, certain prediction applications can have additional evaluation performed around results to ensure predictions are sensible.  stop being stop flag  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practice Practice detail Implement AI applications should include core data security principles model Application similar to any other IT systems. Security by design and data Programming privacy should be embedded into the whole AI application design Interface API  and development processes to protect the data and individual' access security practices right to privacy. Restrict Or control inputs to the Al applications by limiting API calls and a subset of ensemble learning using multiple detection methods to serve API s O users can prevent A model theft Ensemble learning is used to combine different detection methods e.g AI classifiers, detection rules and anomaly detection to improve robustness. Attackers trying to manipulate the input system then have to avoid all these detection mechanisms to be successful in providing malicious input to the AI model through the AI application. All users should be treated equally where possible If organisation has to prioritise certain information or access to technologies differently for different users this should be justified and documented as part of logging for access  using  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practice Practice detail Provide disclosure Create a disclosure document that could be made available to end statements users or the public e.g on website as applicable. This is to encourage transparency and interpretability practices to ensure the Al applications' decisionmaking process is comprehensible to human beings. The document should outline the details on the AI application' s operation and intended use data used and processed model training procedures testing procedures performance metrics and checks performed to evaluate Ethical AI Principles for example, reliability, robustness and security For thirdparty AI applications, organisations should request equivalent documentation from third parties to explain the AI application. Please refer to Section ... Procuring AI Services  for details. Publish policies internally and externally as applicable to distribute information about governance practices to disclose information such as thirdparty engagement, data ownership O compliance to industry standards. Inform users upfront if there are interactions involving AI. For example, notify users on a website Or messaging application to their use of AI chatbots. This is to ensure that endusers Or other subjects are adequately aware that a decision, content advice Or outcome is the result of an Al application or algorithmic decision. Example Organisation should implement API access security practices to adhere to the Reliability, Robustness and Security principle. In the case of a video analytics application, inputs by users should be limited and have controls in place to ensure accuracy whether the input is direct or through APIs. Related Ethical AI Principles . Reliability, Robustness and Security Following security practices and implementing multiple layers of mitigations can ensure security and reliability of the Al application by preventing incorrect outcomes  Human OversightSafety Controls should be implemented that allow for human intervention or autoshutdown in the event of system failure especially when the system failure will have an impact on human safety.  Transparency and Interpretability The description of the AI applications algorithms should be accessible to support building trust in Al usage.  prior  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE  Beneficial AI Provide disclosure statements on the benefits of the AI application to illustrate and promote the common achieved by the AI application where applicable ... Ongoing Monitoring Definition Provide feedback to increase learning and robustness of the AL application Who are involved at this stage? Data Scientists, Project Managers Practices and examples Practice Practice detail Track mistakes Deploy an appropriate corrective action tracking mechanism flagging certain situations for human review to understand the mistakes that the AI application is making so that these mistakes can be resolved. When an AI application has to make decision for situations which are new and unfamiliar, consider implementing a flagging mechanism that will these situations for review. Trigger points such as input data containing new values that were not available in training data can indicate that older training data are no longer valid. Al models can misinterpret information when trying to determine new unknowns from new data input types. Therefore, utilising these trigger points and putting corrective measures in place can limit these mistakes.  good being e.g flag  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practice Practice detail Implement an easy Enable end users or the public as applicable to the AI touse feedback user application to share information about failed predictions O cases interface by designing userfriendly feedback forms. Organisations can encourage end users to communicate quality and timely feedback by offering incentives for example, small gifts or rewards Alternatively, organisation can provide a hotline or email contact of relevant personnel that the end users can reach out to on the organisation s website. Establish a process to incorporate s feedback when AI application maintenance activities are performed. For significant issues, this should be escalated through an existing support channel e.g incident management Example For a medical diagnosis prediction application an audit can be deployed that captures all the medical diagnosis and predictions made. The prediction is then compared and benchmarked against actual results The application can include a feedback' option for the end user to input their feedback with messages to encourage users to provide responses. This aligns with the Reliability, Robustness and Security' principle where continuous improvement to the AI application S reliability and robustness is maintained based on user  feedback Related Ethical AI Principles . Reliability, Robustness and Security Track mistakes to be remediated and user feedback on a regular basis so that the reliability and robustness of the Al application can continually improve. ... Evaluation and Checkin Definition Traceability, Repeatability and Reproducibility are required to ensure the AI application is operating correctly and to help build trust from the public and key stakeholders.

Project Managers, Data Scientists  user'  log  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practices and examples Practice Practice detail Ensure repeatable Ensure that the sourcetoinsights flow of the Al application is a and reproducibility repeatable process through automation This reduces adhoc endtoend workflow processes required when executing the AI application. The Project Team should conduct repeatability tests to ensure endto end workflow is replicable. The Project Team should ensure the AI application' S reproducibility. Reproducibility will ensure that the AI model produces the same results when the same datasets O methods of prediction were used The reproducibility of an AL application is an important gauge to measure trustworthiness. Enable traceability The Project Team should ensure that data are stored appropriately by creating audit trails to document the nonfunctional or functional requirements, model training and decisionmaking processes. This is to avoid alteration of data and audit trails should be retained based on applicable retention periods. Consider establishing a traceability mechanism for the entire data pipeline to enforce accountability and allow tracking of data manipulation activities. An AI application is traceable when its decisions, datasets and processes or algorithm, evaluation parameters, outcomes and error logs are documented and tracked Ensure the AI application's logs and records for example, timestamps ofany scheduling tasks, count of data rOws, the users involved and modelling interactions are generated and stored securely. Please refer to Section ... Technology Roadmap for AI and Data Usage' Section ... Solution Design and Section .... Model Assumptions for contents related to different types of logging Ensure auditability The Project Team should retain evidence that enables the assessment of algorithms, processes and data lineage related to the AI application. This includes evidence from different stages e.g data collection, prepoints processing model training, testing deploying which supports auditability. AlL decisions of the AI application should be documented. The Project Team should record process flow and metadata management of the A application in the logging module within the AI application To ensure that all documentation is up to date a review of the should occur on a regular basis for example, quarterly or yearly.

Performance metrics can be communicated in management reporting  using  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practice Practice detail A set of metrics relevant to the issue Or decision being made by the AI should be developed with exceptionbased reporting across different subgroups of data e.g. different product O end user groups. Examples of metrics such as precision, recall, Fscore or accuracy can be calculated to measure the AI model s performance. This includes checking 0n the success of predictions and the level of inaccuracy that the predictions have to ascertain that the AI model is still performing in an acceptable manner. Refer to examples of bias in data in Section ... 'Data Extraction . Organisations should define AI model indicators to assess whether the AI models are operating as designed to continuously meet their intended Incorporate quality Documenting assumptions on expected inputs, value assessments distributions and boundaries and integrating them into the AI model can help affected instances which could prevent full execution of the AI model and instances that could result in poor predictions. Independent validation should be defined and be performed periodically by the PSCPAT according to the risk of AI models Organisations should periodically assess the AI model indicators to determine whether their AI models are operating as designed. As AI technologies are developing, new risks will be introduced and having a process to continually identify, review and mitigate new risks post deployment will contribute to the reliability, robustness and security of the AI application. Quality assessments should serve as detection and response mechanisms for undesirable adverse effects of the AI application for the enduser or subject for example, if an AI model is not performing as intended, this should be detected and resolved by retuning the model Create anomaly The Project Team should create, implement and monitor anomaly detection techniques detection techniques Anomaly detection refers to identifying outliers or exceptions where the patterns deviate from the expected behaviour within the dataset It is useful in identifying outliers that significantly deviate from the rest of the data and is a useful technique that can be used to prevent adversarial inputs.

Question Context a Is the AI application within an For example, certain 'Internet of Things applications area of intense public scrutiny could have a significant impact on individuals' daily lives e.g because of privacy and privacy. Examples of such applications include Smart concerns andor frequent Cities applications litigation? Smart Lighting intelligent weather adaptive street lighting Smart Traffic Management Monitoring of vehicles and pedestrian Smart Parking Monitoring f parking spaces Therefore, this requires a IT BoardCIO review of the AI Application Impact Assessment The combination of facial recognition and a new, sensitive use or potentially controversial use should be considered b Is the AI application For example, an AI application that is used for the first in a new social domain i.e. time in healthcare while previously, it was only used for where AI has not been used in marketing purposes Due to the change of domain, it is Hong Kong? possible that the AI application will raise new ethical questions When the AI application takes place in C sensitive social area, the risks and the ethical issues are potentially greater Think of topics such as care, safety, the fight against terrorism or education. Think of vulnerable groups such as children or the disabled. The more an AI application acts independently with increased freedom to make decisions, the more important Does the AI application have it is to properly analyse the consequences of this a high degree of autonomy? autonomyIn addition to the freedom to make decisions  yes applied  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK APPENDIX Question Context If the answer to question is autonomy can also lie in the possibility of selecting data Yes  please proceed to the sources autonomously question ii.

Processing with little or no effect on individuals does not If the answer to the question iii match this specific criterion. is Yes' such application will Examples of such AI applications are autonomous vehicle, likely be considered as higher autonomous military drones and surgical robots Such AI risk application. applications are considered used in C complex environment because the decisions made by the AI depend on various surrounding environment factors surrounding human activities. Applications such aS the autonomous vehicle and autonomous military drones are considered to have a high degree of autonomy because decisions were made entirely by the AI d Is sensitive personally When sensitive personally identifiable information is used identifiable information used? in the development andlor deployment of AI applications, the risk is higher For example, data consisting of racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person S sex life or sexual orientation Does the AT application make As the decisionmaking by the AI application is more complex decisions? complex for example, more variables or probabilistic estimates based on profiles the risks increase. Simple AI applications based on a limited number of choices and variables are less risky If the way in which an AI application has come to its decisions can no longer be fully understood or traced back to people, then the risks resulting from the decision are potentially greater. f Does the AI application Processing used to observe, monitor or control involve systemic observation O individuals, including data collected through networks or monitoring? a systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area Examples would include widespread video surveillance data and network behavioural tracking This type of monitoring is  criterion because the personal data may be collected in circumstances where individuals may not be aware of who is collectingtheir data and how theywill  being being get your being e.g  ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK APPENDIX Question Context be used.

4,[Korea] National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence_200323.pdf," GPRN  A National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence The Government of the Republic of Korea Leader Worll Towavd It bevond    Presidential Initiative for Artificial IntelligenceAI October , President Moon Jaein Fellow Koreans and the main architects of the Republic of Koreas artificial intelligence development, At  a.m one early morning in this year an elderly man called out me to an AI speaker as he collapsed from high blood pressure. The virtual assistant recognized his shout as an emergency signal, alerted a  rescue squad and saved his life in the end. Similar cases have been reported several times already The Government has provided Al speakers to perform this function as part of its support for senior citizens who live alone The era of artificial intelligence is now coming into full view Our daily use of artificial intelligence includes automatic translation services on smartphones and automotive navigation systems AlphaGo, which defeated the worlds strongest dan Go player Lee Sedol, might be seen as just the beginning of artificial intelligence AI has progressed to the extent of bringing innovation to industries, transforming our everyday and providing inhome care services. It is moving beyond scientific and technological advancements and is approaching us as a new civilization Today at DEVIEW , Koreas largest artificial intelligence developers conference, I am meeting with the first generation of a new type of humans who are creating an AIbased civilization. Automobiles, one of the mainstays of our conventional flagship industries, are being fused with AI and evolving into future cars, typified by autonomous driving vehicles Korean smart factories, known for using Al to enhance productivity and energy efficiency, has been identified as one of the lighthouse factories those leading the global transformation of manufacturing A Korean startup that applies deeplearning algorithm to detect defects has been valued at USS200 million. Another Korean business venture that produces AIbased software to assist with medical diagnosis has been listed on the AI  ranking, which showcases the  most promising artificial intelligence companies in the world. It has attracted  billion won in venture investment this year alone M National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence help May lives Leader Wovll Towavd JT beyond   Entrepreneurs and developers who are success stories in various AI fields, I am very reassured by and grateful to all of you I am pleased to inform you first of Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence Fellow Koreans, AI is the companion of humanity Humans became the masters of the earth as came to have intelligence and, at the same time, began to take unlimited responsibility for this world. Human beings might be the only creature with high intelligence in the vast universe However we are prone to err and often make irrational decisions. Humanitys intellectual exploration has helped unceasingly expand its own intellectual ability Al is the culmination of a human dream to constantly complement shortcomings and become more perfect The era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is indeed an age in which imagination can change the world. Korea is neither the first country to have ushered in the era of artificial intelligence nor the country with the best AI technology at present However the country has people capable of turning their imagination into reality and taking on challenges to pursue novelty Even in the throes of the  Asian financial crisis, the country led the Internet Revolution and now boasts worldclass manufacturing competitiveness, globally unmatched ICT infrastructure and abundant data concerning egovernment If we link artificial intelligence primarily with the sectors in which we ve accumulated extensive experience and competitiveness, such as manufacturing and semiconductors, we will be able to give birth to the smartest yet most humanlike artificial intelligence The Government will join forces with developers to help them fully utilize their imaginations and turn their ideas into reality First, we Il create an environment where can exercise their imagination to the fullest, work together and take on new challenges. Among the numerous theories on human intelligence, feel particularly drawn to the that its development has been to further cooperation. If we ensure that developers can turn their imagination into reality by switching to socalled negative regulatory system defined by the principle of approve first, regulate later' and if we enable scientists, engineers, artists and students to cooperate by boldly tearing down barriers between different sectors, our countrys Al will bring about the fastest progress in the world We Ma will also create a new model of global cooperation through an AI Olympics, a festival of creative ideas and technologies, and the AI Grand Challenge where the best brains participate in solving pending issues. In addition to existing policies concerning the establishment of Al graduate schools and the Innovation Academy we will allow universities to create new, Or expand existing, majors related to hightech fields. University professors will be permitted to hold positions in companies concurrently, which will attract the worlds best minds to our country We will  actively cooperate with the National Assembly to ensure that the three bills concerning the data economy are before the end of this year writing they they theory help passed  Second, we will provide support companies to earn profits The Government has earmarked . trillion won in next budget for data, networks and AI, up  percent from this We will create an environment in which companies can confidently invest in areas where theyre competitive and quickly make profits We will intensively funnel our policy funds into startups that will determine our future and will create an industrial ecosystem where innovation continues perpetually The Government will make preemptive investments in such sectors as nextgeneration AI chips so as to secure a leading position in the global market Data and cloud computing are needed in the age of AI The Government will fundamentally innovate the establishment opening and utilization of data sources at stage. Open data will be made available to the in principle, and the Government will expand its support for the highcapacity cloud computing needed for the development of AI by businesses, universities and research institutions Third, we will be unrivalled in terms of our use of AI The more people use AI without fear the more our industry can grow Opportunities to learn about Al will be provided to everyone young people in their 20s searching for jobs, employees in their 30s and 40s seeking career changes, those in their 50s and 60s preparing for a secondcareer opportunity after retirement, and seniors. The Government will make sure that Al can be utilized and consumed without restraint Fourth, the Government will become Aloriented. Right after the inauguration, my Administration launched the Presidential Committee on the Fourth Industrial Revolution. It selected 'Data, Network, and AIDNA' as three new innovative industries and has supported them Last year 'AI RandD Strategy' and Data Industry Vitalization Strategy' were put in place at the pangovernment level and have steadily been implemented. The Government itself will actively use and support AI at every opportunity We will transform ourselves into an A  based digital government, going beyond the worlds best egovernment We will provide high quality services, starting with those areas that can directly impact the peoples lives such as the environment disasters, safety and national defense, so that the can sense the changes. The Governments public services will also be transitioned to internet and smartphonebased ones Fellow Koreans, distinguished AI developers and Entrepreneurs, the advancement of Al lead humanity into a world never experienced before. Al will not only affect industrial sectors but also solve many issues facing our society public health in an aging society welfare for senior citizens living alone, the safety of women living by themselves and the prevention of crimes that are becoming more sophisticated Let us work together so that Al can operate in people  centered manner and become a driving force behind social innovation By the end of this year the Government will propose a national AI strategy based on this framework initiative for completely new AI The Korean government will also pay special attention to changes in the job market and AIrelated ethical issues The development of innovative technologies will be achieved through sharing and interaction like at DEVIEW 2019 Iask you to share your rich experience and wisdom filled with innovative imagination I everyone will work together to realize our dream. Thank you National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence years year public every public  will hope  Foreword The world is entering a new era of transformation, the 4th Industrial Revolution, and artificial intelligenceAI is at the center of this revolution AI, which only existed in the imagination in the past, is rapidly growing based on the development of ICTs such as the increase of computing power data accumulation, and network advancement such as 5G. AI has started to be used and spread through all industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, environment and education, and we can now easily encounter it in almost aspect of our daily lives. Artificial intelligence, with its cognitive, learning, and reasoning abilities, is expected to assist or replace human intellectual functions in the future, in the same way as machines such as steam engines substituted human physical labor in the age of industrialization. AI will create new added value by catalyzing innovation throughout the industries, provide people with greater convenience in their daily lives, and will also be powerful way to resolve social problems such as population aging and crime prevention In the Al era, AI fundamentally changes the way of working and the job structure, while proliferation of Al could present dysfunction and security threats Therefore, rather than accepting these changes passively, we should be active change agents in creating a brighter future. I think it is time for us to prepare for a world where people and artificial intelligence can coexist. For this, in December last year the government adopted a governmentwide National for Artificial Intelligence under the vision of Toward AI World Leader beyond IT in an effort to give to the Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence Oct.  announced by President Moon Jaein The strategy focused on maximizing our national strengths such as the worlds best ICT infrastructure and semiconductor and manufacturing technology while realizing peoplecentered artificial intelligence with consideration and respect for people beyond technical and industrial viewpoints If the public and private sectors work together to successfully implement this national strategy we can secure worldclass digital competitiveness and significantly improve the quality of life for people by . We are standing at an important crossroads where the of our future generations are at stake In the meantime we have to enhance our nations capacities to raise our status as the worlds top economy and to enable to enjoy a more affluent and happier life.

Firms and organizations across all sectors strive to maximize the potential of their data to make better decisions for commercial and social purposes From a technical perspective , there are several types of Al applications, such as machine learning, deep learning, hybrid learning and digital twins Some of the industries seen as benefiting from Al in Cambodia are healthcare, education, and finance. For healthcare, Al can be used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnoses and identify potential health risks and preventative measures For example, Al can analyze medical images and identify abnormalities such as tumors or other potential health issues. In addition Al can be used in education in Cambodia to improve the quality and accessibility of education. Another area where Al is beginning to have an impact in Cambodia is finance. Al is being used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of financial transactions and identify potential fraud and money laundering Overall the development and adoption of Al in Cambodia is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to transform many aspects of society. The key challenges and opportunities in this area include the need for specialized skills and expertise, as well as the need to address ethical and privacy concerns. With continued investment and development Al has the potential to greatly benefit Cambodia in the coming years. Strategically, RandD is essential to cope with the Alenabled advancements in the world With billions of dollars expected to be generated from Al globally, Cambodia sees the need and urgency to invest, adapt, and prepare for this Al global force in line with the industry . trend as the economy increasingly becomes knowledge and digitalbased. There are many challenges and concerns that come with the use of Al. Certainly, machine learning requires massive amounts of data and computing time. Researchers are generally challenged when it comes to finding highquality, unbiased training sets to teach Al. In many cases, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of records, are required to properly implement deep learning algorithms. And data sets containing biased information can lead to undesirable results. There are other cultural challenges to consider that branch out into new issues for leadership. vii  when it comes to incorporating Al. Also, there has been much written about how Al will take jobs away from unskilled or easily automated workers In Cambodia, this technology is not just about Al. It is about creating a digital framework within the existing infrastructure to implement its learning capability alongside the work of information and communication technology. relevant legal framework on data and cybersecurity is also needed to be in force to combat cybercrimes and provide assurance to relevant businesses, practitioners, and consumers in the field. Infrastructure is the and there is already a basic technological foundation that Cambodia has been building for years that will be leveraged to maximize the impact of Al Last but not least, Al is one of the essential technologies in the world that is gamechanging in every sector to improve productivity, efficiency, and costeffectiveness. In order to foster trustworthy Al ecosystems, it is essential for countries to develop humancentered policies that promote socioeconomic and responsible Al research and development. This includes policies that encourage investment in such initiatives. These policies for Al development should take into account its national development vision as well as regional and global trends The country's objectives, preferences, and overarching strategy for Al advancement in the immediate and distant future should be clarified. Initially, the main objective is to cultivate skilled personnel and employ Al solutions to deal with critical national focus areas that will have a swift impact on Cambodia's socioeconomic status. Over time, the priority should shift to developing fundamental and advanced research, promoting highlevel Al research and innovation and establishing Cambodia's standing in advanced technology on a global viii key,  Editorial Team CHHEM Kieth Rethy, MD, PhD edu , PhD his EditorinChief HUL Seingheng PhD Senior Editor MOUNH MSc Assistant Editor Contributors .

TrendMegatrends The fastmoving trend of Artificial Intelligence Al has gained its impetus to fundamentally change the business and economy landscape and society for the last few years The term Artificial Intelligence Al was first coined in  to broadly address the machine simulation of intelligence where the machine can simulate every aspect of learning and feature of intelligence Lau and Haugh, . Over six decades, the evolutionary development of Al is astonishing and proofs its capability from simple neural networks, multilevel text analytics, deep learning image analytics, selfadaptive and natural language processing breakthrough, neuromorphic technology, and the edge of human consciousness system development At this new stage of Al commercialisation the ecosystem of industries is disrupted and expectedly forcibly transformed into digital and technological capability at various layers Deloitte,  firstly, the enterprise with maturity in Al application and capable resources will use Al in both management and production processes to foresee, with the use of datamining, the global megatrend and the ability of their products and services to be commercialised. This enterprise change will cover sales, security, antifraud, human resource management marketing, personal assistant and smart tools The second layer of industry change is expected to optimise the relationship between upstream and downstream sectors on the traditional industry chain where the consumer can access the product features directly. This industry change will take its course in finance, healthcare, education, retail, manufacturing, media, agriculture, and logistics, to name a Lastly, the future labor structure of enterprises will be transformed with virtual and augmented realities, gesture recognition, and robots to increase productivity and competitiveness The embrace of Al among ASEAN member states AMS , of which  of ASEAN is at the early stages, and  of ASEAN is at advanced stages, is still at the nascent stages given the differences in the national priority, strategic investment, piloting initiatives within discrete activities, scaling initiatives, and endtoend scaled implementation of Al Chua and Dobberstein, . The potential of Al contribution to the region's Growth Domestic Product GDP is forecasted to be approximately USS trillion, accounted for about  to  of DGP uplift across AMS in . Nevertheless the impact variance will be varied from one AMS to another based on the country's maturity in terms of Al infrastructure and adoption readiness for instance, Cambodia, at the early stage of Al adoption, focuses more on the primary sectors Chua and Dobberstein,  The top five sectors which will benefit from Al include  manufacturing  retail and hospitality,  agriculture,  government, safetylsecurity, and smartcities,  healthcare. With Industry . technologies Al could further advance the entire value chain, from product engineering and supply chain management to logistics and circular management While having a dynamic and few  mobilecentric population, the ASEAN region will boost retail and hospitality with machine learning and big data advancement. For the agricultural sector drone and image recognition technologies will contribute to the prevention of crop diseases, pesticide and fertiliser application, and post harvest management Amid the complexity of challenges pertaining to the public sectors, Al will play essential role in resources' optimisation, traffic congestion relief education and healthcare such as the accessibility to healthcare service, tracking, and management of infectious diseases. Al is no longer the futuristic term in Cambodia as the Al community is exponentially growing while Al technologies have become a reality and used in various sectors. Early Al community is seen in  , i.e. an opensource algorithms community to develop Al skills in Cambodia, initiated by a regional startup, WWWslash co. One such Al application is the flood detection system, managed by People In Need, to potentially identify false positive alarms and predict flood risk among other projects identity match, fraud detection, smart city, Khmer Chatbot, eKYCKnow Your Customer system, and Al for Real Estate business. Another deployment of Al is the Demine Robotics with the three key functions  detect  retrieve, and  destroy and the uniqueness of this robot is its small size, strength, intelligence , machine efficiency, machine sensitivity, and data collection Other Al prototypes include SCARA Robot, 4DOF Robot Manipulator Dual Axis Solar Tracker Drone Hexacopter , and Mobile Robot using Omni Wheel, at Intelligent Mechatronics Laboratory, Institute of Technology of Cambodia Universities including the National Institute of Posts, Telecommunications and ICT with new name as Cambodia Academy of Digital Technology, the American University of Phnom Penh, Kirirom Institute of Technology, and the Institute of Technology of Cambodia offer courses in Al, which will nurture the local talent. While constrained by the lockdown and healthsafety measures, the early transformation of the soft and hard infrastructure of business could be seen across Cambodia The earliest is the dinein restaurant where the service is turned to only takeaway and delivery. The drivethrough and curbside restaurant and stores become relianton the preorder and delivery App. The school is closed, and the physical classroom becomes online. Digital platforms and services viz Foodpanda, Nham24, BLOC, Cambodia AEON Online, become overnight popular. As such Al integration will be potential for business in Cambodia. .. Need Al adoption Artificial Intelligence has the capability to simulate intelligent, humanlike behavior in computers, high speed with cuttingage technology, where the applications of Al are enormous including finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, education, agriculture, transportation, law, etc. There are various forms of Al, such as Machine learning Expert Systems, Robotics, Neural Networks, Fuzzy Logic, and Natural Language Processing For instance, machine learning in which machines could encompass neural networks and deep learning like our human brains, can observe, analyse, and  an  learn from facts and errors rather than being told what to believe This technology has an impact on consumer items and has resulted in important discoveries in healthcare and physics, as well as changes in industries as diverse as manufacturing, banking, and retail. Over time , machine learning algorithms increase their performance by learning from data. In this way, computers can adapt to conditions that are unforeseen and cannot be codified by static rules. Driving a car and chatting with a customer are examples of such jobs. On rare occasions, the computer may even come up with a solution that no human has ever thought of Marr,  Smart Nation Digital Government Office, . For instance, Al has been implemented and adopted in industry for a variety of purposes, including Marr ,  SAS Institute Inc,  Manufacturing Al can be used to optimise areas of production such as yield, energy or throughput optimisation, assembly, and quality testing during the manufacturing process Heath Care A personal health care assistant will be able to help with daily tasks medicine, exercise, diet detect the patient illness symptom and to predict chronic disease Retail Consumers may do virtual shopping, receive tailored suggestions, and discuss their purchasing alternatives. With the help of Al, the business will grow faster Banking Al improves speed, precision , effectiveness of human error with ability to detect the fraudulent of unusual transactions, etc Public Sector Make smart cities smarter, support the national defense, enhance effectiveness of the public services, etc. The application of Al is limitless It will always depend on its purpose, ie. who and where should Al be adopted, must be carefully determined . Alignment to Vision Artificial intelligence's progress and spread provide new and significant problems for technologists, humanity, and sentient life in general. The question of whator whosevalues Al systems should be associated with is the most important of these Gabriel,  Furthermore, there is a lack of clarity and consistency in the worldwide debates about Al that are taking place among governments and the private sector on what the guiding principles should be for policymakers, academics, and companies. There is widespread agreement that legislative guidelines and safeguards are needed for the use of AIML Artificial IntelligenceMachine Learning in healthcare but before effective legislation can be developed, there must be consensus on the technology's vision and goal.  key  Regulation is built on the foundation of preexisting ideas and beliefs about what technology is, what it seeks to achieve, and how it should be utilised This involves  Determining how it will not be utilised and  assessing the risks that should be avoided. Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD Al principles identify as the following OECD,  Al should benefit people and the planet by driving inclusive growth, sustainable development and wellbeing Al systems should be designed in a way that respects the rules of law, human rights democratic values, and diversity, and should include appropriate safeguards for example, enabling human intervention where necessary to ensure a fair and just society There should be transparency and responsible disclosure around Al systems to ensure that people understand Albased outcomes and can challenge them Al systems must function in a robust, secure and safe way throughout their life cycles, and potential risks should be continually assessed and managed Organisations and individuals developing, deploying or operating Al systems should be held accountable for their proper functioning in line with the above principles The OECD also provides specific recommendations to governments on to put these value based principles into action Facilitate public and private investment in research and development to spur innovation in trustworthy Al Foster accessible Al ecosystems with digital infrastructure and technologies and mechanisms to share data and knowledge Ensure a policy environment that will open the way to deployment of trustworthy Al systems Empower people with the skills for Al and support workers for a fair transition Cooperate across borders and sectors to progress on responsible stewardship of trustworthy Al. The application of the OECD principles is still questioning since many organisations have their own principles of Al usage as well These themes call out areas that need to be addressed in any future policy or law governing the use of Al such as privacy, accountability, safety and security, transparency and explainability, fairness and nondiscrimination, human control of technology, professional responsibility, and promotion of human values. To fit with Cambodia's vision of the future for utilisation of Al, strategic adaptation of Al usage, the concepts from the OECD and other major organisations should be examined in order to develop country rule, they how key  legislation, regulation, and guidelines on how Al should be utilised for government, private, and corporate purposes. . Alpowered business and industry Transforming Business Landscape in Cambodia . . Business Artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionise many aspects of business, from improving decisionmaking and automation to enabling new products and services. In recent years, Al has become increasingly widespread in business, with many organisations adopting Al technologies to a competitive edge. However, Cambodian businesses are yet to take a full advantage of Al solutions. One of the key ways that Al is being used in business is for decisionmaking and automation Al algorithms are able to process vast amounts of data and identify patterns and trends that can inform business decisions This allows organisations to make more accurate and efficient decisions, which can lead to improved operations and increased profitability. In addition, Al is being used to automate many tasks and processes in business For example, Al algorithms can be used to automate customer service, data entry, and other routine tasks, freeing up employees to focus on more complex and valueadded activities. This can help to increase productivity and reduce costs. In Cambodia simple machine Al for use in industrial factories is being developed by Quantum Engineering and Manufacturing Another area where Al is having a significant impact on business is in the development of new products and services. Al algorithms are being used to create personalised experiences for customers, such as personalised product recommendations and personalised content This can help to improve customer satisfaction and fidelity , and can also drive revenue growth. However the use of Al in business is not without its challenges One of the key issues is the need for specialised skills and expertise. Developing and deploying Al algorithms requires a high level of technical knowledge, and many organisations may struggle to find the necessary talent In addition there are often ethical and privacy concerns surrounding the use of Al in business, and organisations need to carefully consider these issues Some of the industries that can benefit from Al in Cambodia are healthcare, education, and finance. For healthcare, Al can be used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnoses and to identify potential health risks and preventative measures. For example, Al can analyse medical images and identify abnormalities, such as tumors or other potential health issues This can help to improve the quality of healthcare and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis There are currently already developed equipment and tools that Cambodian healthcare centers can acquire and implement  gain  In addition, Al can be used in education in Cambodia to improve the quality of and accessibility to education For example, Al can be used to create personalised learning experiences for students, allowing them to learn at their own pace and in a way that is tailored to their individual needs. This can help to improve student outcomes and increase the efficiency of the education system. Another area where Al is beginning to have an impact in Cambodia is in finance. Al is being used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of financial transactions, and to identify potential fraud and money laundering This can help improve the security and reliability of the financial system, and can also help increase the access to financial services for individuals and businesses Al is transforming many aspects of business, and its impact is to continue to grow in the coming years. Organisations that are able to effectively adopt and integrate Al technologies are likely to gain a competitive advantage, while those that are unable to do so may struggle to keep pace in the competition. Overall, the development and adoption of Al in Cambodia is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to transform many aspects of society The key challenges and opportunities in this area include the need for specialised skills and expertise, as well as the need to address ethical and privacy concerns With continued investment and development, Al has the potential to greatly benetit Cambodia in the coming years. .. Infrastructure Artificial intelligence is a rapidly growing field that has the potential to transform many aspects of society , from healthcare and transportation to finance and education. However, for Al to reach its full potential, it requires a robust infrastructure that can support the development and deployment of Al systems Currently in Cambodia, there is no proper Al infrastructure that allows complex development in the field. In this report we will explore the current state of Al infrastructure and discuss some of the key challenges and opportunities in this area generally and in Cambodia Sallomi et al., . Al infrastructure refers to the hardware, software, and other resources that are needed to support the development and deployment of Al systems Muller,  . It includes the hardware and software platforms, data storage and management systems, and other tools and resources that are required to build, train, and deploy Al models One of the components of Al infrastructure is the hardware on which Al algorithms are run In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the availability of specialised hardware for Al, such as graphical processing units and tensor processing units. These hardware platforms are designed to be highly efficient at running the complex calculations required by many Al algorithms, allowing them to perform faster and more accurately. However, the development of likely key  specialised hardware for Al is not without its challenges One of the key issues is the cost of these platforms, which can be prohibitively expensive for many organisations. In addition, the rapid pace of innovation in the Al hardware space means that the hardware used for Al today may quickly become outdated Another important component of Al infrastructure is the availability of data. Al algorithms require large amounts of highquality data to be trained and tested The availability of data is therefore a key factor in the development of Al systems. However the collection and curation of highquality data can be a timeconsuming and expensive process. In addition, there are often privacy and ethical concerns surrounding the use of data for Al purposes. One potential solution to these challenges is the use of synthetic data, which is data that is generated artificially rather than collected from realworld sources Synthetic data has the advantage of being readily available and controllable, but it can be difficult to ensure that it accurately reflects the realworld conditions that Al systems will encounter Dilmegani,  In addition to hardware and data, Al infrastructure also includes the software tools and platforms that are used to develop and deploy Al systems There are a wide variety of tools and platforms available, ranging from opensource libraries and frameworks to proprietary software tools. This includes programming languages such as Python, and libraries such as TensorFIow, and PyTorch, as well as tools for data preprocessing, model training, and model deployment These tools and platforms can make it easier for developers to build and deploy Al systems, but can also introduce their own challenges, such as vendor lockin and the need for specialised skills. Other parts of Al infrastructure include the data storage and management systems to store and organise the large datasets that are used to train and test Al models This may include data warehouses, databases, and other storage systems that are designed to handle the scale and complexity of Al data Overall, the development of Al infrastructure is a complex and rapidly evolving field For a country like Cambodia to participate in this development it requires a combination of specialised hardware, highquality data, and powerful software tools and platforms The challenges and opportunities in this area are numerous, but with continued investment and innovation, Al has the potential to transform many aspects of society in the coming years. Thus, a robust plan for Al investment and implementation might be a worthwhile challenge for Cambodia. Artificial intelligence AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of business, from improving decisionmaking and automation to enabling new products and services. Moreover, Cambodian businesses are to take full advantage of Al solutions they yet  One keyway Al is used in the business is for decisionmaking and automation Hence, Al algorithms can process vast amounts of data and identify patterns and trends that can inform business decisions, allowing organizations to make more accurate and efficient decisions, leading to improved operations and increased profitability. In addition, Al is being used to automate many tasks and processes in business For example, AI algorithms can automate customer service, data entry, and other routine tasks, freeing employees to focus on more complex and valueadded activities Scheneider , . This can help to increase productivity and reduce costs. For example, in Cambodia, simple machine Al for use in industrial factories is being developed by Quantum Engineering and Manufacturing Another area where Al is having a significant impact on business is in the development of new products and services. For example, Al algorithms create personalized customer experiences, such as product recommendations and content that can help improve customer satisfaction and loyalty and drive revenue growth However, the use of Al in business has its challenges. One of the key issues is the need for specialized skills and expertise. Developing and deploying Al algorithms requires a high level of technical knowledge and many organizations may need help finding the necessary talent In addition there are often ethical and privacy concerns surrounding the use of Al in business, and organizations must carefully consider these issues For example, there are already developed equipment and tools that Cambodian healthcare centres can acquire and implement In addition, Al can be used in education in Cambodia to improve the quality and accessibility of education For example, Al algorithms can be used to create personalized learning experiences for students, allowing them to learn at their own pace and in a way tailored to their individual needs, which can improve student outcomes and increase the efficiency of the education system. Another area where Al is beginning to have an impact in Cambodia is finance. Al algorithms are being used to improve financial transactions' accuracy and efficiency and identify potential fraud and money laundering This can improve the security and reliability of the financial system and help increase access to financial services for individuals and businesses. Al is transforming many aspects of business, and its impact will continue to grow in the coming years As a result organizations that can effectively adopt and integrate Al technologies will likely a competitive advantage. At the same time, those unable to do so may need help to keep pace with the competition. Overall, the development and adoption of Al in Cambodia are still in their early stages, but it can potentially transform many aspects of society. The challenges and opportunities in this area include the need for specialized skills and expertise and the need to address ethical and privacy concerns Nevertheless, with continued investment and development Al has the potential to benetit Cambodia in the coming years greatly.  gain key  3 Al Revolution Global Trends and Practical Applications In today's datadriven world, the application of Al around the world continues to grow exponentially Firms and organisations across all sectors strive to maximise the potential of their data, to make improved decisions for commercial purposes and social impact. From a technical perspective, there exists several forms of Al applications such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Hybrid Learning, and Digital Twins According to pricewaterhousecoopers , Machine Learning can be utilised for 3D mapping of bridge construction based on data from drones, as well as for spotting insider trading In addition, Deep Learning is being used to develop customer behavior models Furthermore, Hybrid Learning that is based on probabilistic programming in using incomplete information to work with uncertainty, can be beneficial for analysing market behavior and regulatory environments Finally, Digital Twins that replicate virtually physical and nonphysical assets, are ideal for capital project management and helping financial institutions to model individual policyholders, as well as simulate future balance sheets and cash flows Moving onto more practical use cases of Al, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan  Trends in Data and Al for  and Beyond mentions that  Companies continue bold momentum,  Customer experience analytics take center stage,  Those who leverage external data outperform competitors by double digits,  Chief Data Officers lead the charge toward a datadriven culture,  Data science loses its luster, and  Data exposes wide gaps in equity and also empowers change' Trend  Companies continue bold momentum focuses on the continuous growth of Al applications during the COVID pandemic, including the acceleration of cloud migration plans, taking advantage of this disruptive period to challenge the status quo and undergo digital transformation, as well as focusing on the first  of change which is often the most challenging step. Trend  Customer experience analytics take center stage highlights the importance of customerrelated data to improve customer experience with the help of data fabric and data lakehouse, and analysing different forms of interactions such as voice analytics and customer interaction with chatbots or call centers. Trend  Those who leverage external data outperform competitors by double digits emphasises starting with the core business problem, followed by strategising what potential data could be utilised to solve it, in addition to modernising data flows. Cindi Howson, Chief Data Strategy Officer of Thoughtspot shared that The range of data sources has exploded, the only thing lacking here is really your imagination' Trend  Chief Data Officers CDOs lead the charge toward a datadriven culture shines a light on the growing significance of CDO roles, in showing companies and employees the efficiency gained with using data, consequently requiring the upskill of workers to take full advantage of new technologies Trend  Data science loses its luster discusses the importance of rebalancing the overemphasis on coding and math, but rather focusing on business application and improving communications skills and data storytelling Trend  Data exposes wide gaps in equity and  empowers change narrows down on the biased data and lack of team diversity building Al programs which in turn skews the output of Al algorithms In conclusion, the article conveys that Al applications should strive for a smarter, more factdriven world, powered by data and analytics Brown . The COVID pandemic has also led to the establishment of a wide range of Al applications, in efforts to tackle its resulting challenges. Forbes The  Top Artificial Intelligence Trends for  describes several use cases of Al, starting with smarter big data analytics and insights. Big Data and Al applications are being utilised to quickly analyse and interpret data on the spread of the virus around the world, including a Natural Language Processing NLP powered search engine to navigate COVID related literature in data sets, as well as Machine Learning to identify outbreaks with more ease, contact tracing between infected individuals, enabling more accurate diagnoses, predicting virus evolution, and developing more effective lasting vaccinations In addition, automated detection and prevention is being carried out in the form of drones to detect COVID symptoms such as high temperature of individuals in crowds, in combination with computer vision to analyse camera data. Businesses are also utilising data to rebound from the commercial and economic impacts of the pandemic, by predicting behavioral transformation Finally, collaborative Al initiatives are being prepared around the world to shut down the next pandemic before it even starts Learning from the past pandemics and the current COVID pandemic, the international exchange of relevant data and best practices will play a major role in preparing for the future Marr, .  Driving Al Development in Cambodia The Power of Collaboration Generic introduction of the chapter why is collaboration important? Where to start? How to start? What are the challenges for local and global collaboration? What will be the impact of success and failure on building collaboration? Collaboration plays a pivotal role in knowledge sharing particularly important for multi disciplinarymulticountry research, innovation and development work In many occasions knowledge sharing occurs through reported articles that are not securitysensitive, do not have Intellectual Property Right IPR issues and are not sensitive to financial income. Globally , many countries developed strategic agreements to share their knowledge related to security for example, the UK with the US , business and socioeconomic growth Data collection, analysis and decision making using Al are playing a significant role in this type of knowledge sharing framework The knowledge sharing framework brings various benefits, for example, this saves a significant research or innovation investment for the reinvention of the wheel The Cambodian government and businesses should take initiative to develop similar regional and global collaboration based on the needs of the socioeconomic growth and security of the country This requires developing a strategic framework for specific data or knowledge to be shared for the   important sectors security, innovation and research, crisis and disaster management, cultural understanding economic growth, health and wellbeing Failure to build this type of strategic collaborative knowledge sharing activity will bring detrimental effects on the sustainable development Goals SDGs Sustainable Development Solution Network  and security particularly , cybersecurity of the country However the challenges in building collaboration are normally the trust of the stakeholders, barriers for mutual economic benefits and communicationcultural gaps between the parties. To overcome these challenges, the stakeholders need to communicate and discuss developing a strategic longterm regional and global collaboration framework using data and knowledge sharing infrastructure. .. Quadruplel Triple Helix Approach are the stakeholders' engagementlcollaborations important, particularly for a country like Cambodia? Who will take initiative? How? When? How to prepare a sustainable collaborative framework? What are the key factors that may stimulate applied research and innovation to build collaboration? Should we start with Quadrupleltriplelboth helix approaches? Financing RandD Policy formulation Education Innovation Incubators Government Academia Spinoffs support Advisory services Collaboration Entrepreneurial platform venturing Legitimatinglink Product and Industry Civfl society Competence and service process development development Carrying individua and structural perspectives Figure . Collaborative Quadruple Helix Framework Lindberg et al,  The stakeholders' engagementlcollaborations are important particularly in a country like Cambodia because we need to enhance the development of new knowledge and to transform this knowledge into innovations Cambodia's development challenges include manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare, transportation, energy, science and technology. The initiative needs to come from the local government as it plays an important role in integrating changes in principles and practices into local development and investment plans Working together to establish relationships toward a process to generate the outcome of something in common are essential characteristics that may inspire applied research and innovation to foster collaboration. Because addressing issues requires more than one person,  key Why  group, or organisation, collaborative connections are critical hence, the outcome of collaboration might generate new metrics of success in economic development. collaborative approach includes more than just working together. It refers to the ability to work together and take action on largescale projects. Traditional strategic planning is not a good model for the disciplines that will be required to rebuild our economy. Thinking together refers to a series of interactions involving academics the university , business, and government in order to encourage economic and social growth through a Triple Helix model of innovation. Several nations have embraced the Triple Helix approach to foster innovation through the notion of institutions and policy making The Triple Helix interaction pattern is said to be capable of establishing links and interactions between science and technology, as well as gathering individuals from many disciplines to engage in the process of information exchange ideas, and thoughts The quadruple helix paradigm may be regarded as an improvement on the triple helix approach in that it not only focuses on the players from academics, government and business but also acknowledges society's growing involvement The framework seeks to bridge the gap between innovation and civil society, claiming that under the triple helix paradigm, new technologies do not necessarily meet societal expectations and requirements, limiting their potential effect Investing more in research, innovation, and entrepreneurship should be at the core of Cambodia's development strategy, since it is the only way to achieve smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth. This idea expands on the triple helix model by assuming that society, in addition to academics, business, and government is a significant actor in innovation processes Cambodia may be ideal for creating smart specialisation plans based on the quadruple helix method, which would create an environment conducive to entrepreneurship and innovation which has been identified as a priority by policymakers and politicians. This is primarily because innovation and entrepreneurship are viewed as means to create new employment while also raising living standards through new and improved products. However, in order for the quadruple helix method to work we need a good leader who can turn knowledge into action. A good Leader needs to be good with the group and be able to manage the multidisciplinarylmulticountries collaborative teamwork How can we effectively support individuals while simultaneously changing big systems? By follow some of these rules One conversion at the time, stay focused as design thinking offers an approach for addressing these and other big questions Restraint from criticising an idea Work with cool ideas and buildable   Work on a time constraint, if not the team will never get anything done Mock up combine into a working prototype Fail often in order to succeed sooner Took the best element out of every prototype and created another workable. Lot of hours, be open minded, a leader that is demanding fresh ideas, be quirky and clash with him. belief that Chaos can be constructive and teamwork a great deal of teamwork, and these a good recipe for innovation The team needs to explore the paradox of crossboundary work and learn about trust dynamics, conflict management and the advantages and challenges of global teams .. Common and Inclusive Development What are the common issues that may stimulate mutual benefits and opportunities of collaboration? What are the challenges including the digital divide for inclusive development? How could we develop a collaborative framework that will help in inclusive development? Which stakeholders should contribute to addressing the inclusive issue and in what form a table might help? Biasness, inequality and ethical issues related to inclusive development The common issues that may stimulate mutual benefits and opportunities of collaboration are manufacturing agriculture, healthcare, transportation, energy, science and technology The challenges including the digital divide for inclusive development are Skill gap in Al at all educational levels This involves revisions at the elementary, secondary, and tertiary levels of education to include Alrelated courses and programs into school curriculum It is also necessary to provide chances for instructors to receive training and upskill in order to teach Alrelated courses Second numerous policies give specific incentives for largescale lifelong learning and reskilling via massive open online courses and reskilling Gender inequality in science and technology fields Skill shortages are a major impediment to innovation, stifling productivity growth and economic progress. Shortages of skilled professionals in areas linked to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics STEM in particular may limit a society's ability to innovate. Over the years, a significant gender disparity has remained at all levels of STEM disciplines around the world Throughout the world, a significant gender disparity has remained at all levels of STEM fields Despite significant gains in women's involvement in higher education they remain underrepresented in these professions This issue is particularly serious at the top of academic and professional hierarchies. Empirical studies show that countries with a higher proportion of  key key  engineering graduates tend to grow faster than countries with a higher proportion of graduates in other disciplines Lack of Al policy related to smart governance, smart innovation and smart regulations The absence of information in Cambodia refrains academics from furthering their understanding of the problem and policymakers from devising effective remedies This note intends to add to the regional academic and policy discussion by examining the key variables proposed in the literature to explain gender discrepancies in STEM recruitment, retention, and promotion, as well as by proposing new factors Ethical, Privacy and IPR issues The ethical issues of Al applications are growing significantly. This includes data privacy and IPR associated with the data Therefore, a strategic plan is essential to avoid misusing Al growth and data associated with that. .3 Global Education, Research and Innovation Why is the global collaboration for knowledge sharing through education, research and innovation important? What are types of collaboration to be developed? With which organisationslcountries? How to build these collaborations? What are the funding agencies that may help in stimulating this collaboration? How to develop trainedlskilled manpower to build collaboration hire initially? When to start and where to start? Researchinformed teaching to accelerate the process National Al and Data Centre for Research and Development RandD Commercialisation of the outcomes of Al research and innovation Research, innovation, researchinformed teaching and Al application development to solve real world problems are interconnected as shown in Figure . It reflects multidisciplinary collaborative teamwork is always to achieve success. Al application is a marketdriven dynamic area, therefore , requires global collaboration and rapid policy actions to play with the international partners This also requires continuously identifying skill gaps in education, research and innovation Based on the gap, there should be a method to train young talent abroad to fill this gap. Subsequently, offer an attractive incentive to the trained talent to return to the existing workforce at home. To create this opportunity, Cambodia needs to develop a strategic collaboration with regional and global institutions, offer scholarship based higher study for  key  talented young people and make an attractive support framework with a national Al and data centre as their home. A strategic plan for RandD is very important to cope with the Alenabled advancement in the world. The plan should have objectives and a direction of advancements to amplify efficiency. Cambodia sees itself thriving significantly in creating worldclass research and advancement in some innovation fields It is obligatory that Al is embedded in the RandD as well as other divisions to leverage its potential application. Based on our investigation, we recommend the following in the strategic plan Need to set up a centre of excellence with leading experts from different backgrounds to work together for Al, data and associated technologies collaborative framework see Figure  with industries, universities, government and young entrepreneurs for applied research and innovation for knowledge transfer Regular engagement for knowledge sharing through meetings, seminars and interactive workshops Government investment strategy with an appropriate policy framework to promote the job skills of the young people Development of research centres in the universities in collaboration with industries and business to promote researchlinnovation informed teaching Develop a database of experts in Cambodia to promote collaborative activities with government support Develop a policy and practices for security, privacy and ethical issues related to the data and AI applications Need continuous exploration for potential regional and global research and innovation funds, stafflstudent exchange opportunities and partnership development to exchange knowledge Last but not least develop a strategic framework to attract young people for new skill sets through a publicprivate partnership Finally, Cambodia is moving towards a digital economy with new challenges as a middleincome country in . A collaborative framework as shown in Figure  with strategic investment and policy is essential to develop skill sets of young people for Al applications. As applied research is key to generating knowledge, we need to embed this into the teaching, training and innovation for dynamic technology changes with a focus on sustainable economic growth.

A collaborative framework to work together to develop new skill sets, research, research informed teaching and innovation . Al for Socioeconomic Transformation A Strategic Vision and Roadmap .. Socioeconomic Impact Accenture research on  developed economies countries indicated that Al has the power to double annual economic growth rates in , changing the nature of work and creating a new relationship between man and machine. Also, the world economic forum reported that Al and Robots would create more jobs than they displace. Because of Al and related technologies, economic growth will boost up than ever before and create many additional job opportunities According to McKinsey Global Institute, about  cases of SDGs where Al can be instrumental in solving problems It has been suggested that Al can help a country such as Cambodia achieve approximately  percent of all the development targets listed in SDGs by  largely through the improvement of technology itself which is the main component in economic growth theory Vinuesa et al,, . In particular Al can, for instance, help increase productivity and income and thereby significantly decrease absolute poverty or identify areas with a high poverty rate for further action Jean et al,,  Goal , support agriculture and provision of food to end hunger Gandhi et al,,  Goal , lead to better health outcome and efficiency of healthcare delivery including diagnostics Yu et al,,  Goal , improve teaching and learning method by offering intelligent tutoring system that tailors to specific student's needs and thus boost the quality of education Perrotta and Selwyn,  Goal , and enable the design of sustainable smart cities and reduce consumptions of natural resources Vinuesa et al.,  Goal .   On the microlevel Al can help the market system improve resource allocation and industrial organisation and strengthen firms' competitiveness Phyrom et al,, . Moreover, data and Al are said to reduce information asymmetry which is a form of market failure allowing the market to reach an optimal equilibrium In terms of labor market structure, opportunities will arise as new kinds of services industries and businesses, namely ecommerce e.g, Amazon, Alibaba, eBay , epayment e.g, Alipay, PayPal, and social media e.g, Facebook, Twitter , will also emerge Phyrom et al, . And with those come new types of employment It is predicted by the World Economic Forum that about  million new jobs will be created by  in several sectors, including Artificial Intelligence, robotics, immersive technology, green technology, and blockchain World Economic Forum . In addition, the nature of the employment itself, especially jobs related to software and technology development and multimedia will be more flexible owing to the fact that now we can collaborate more effectively using an online platform and that workers no longer need to commute to their physical workplace. But at the same time, questions have also been raised about the possible negative impacts of Al on patients, especially ethical issues regarding how personal data should be treated Al requires large amount of data which has gradually become a new oil that can be generated endlessly every and such data is handy for many ways and reasons, yet it can pose serious challenges if it falls into the wrong hands or rival countries, and that will compromise national securities along with other dimensions of socioeconomic development Considering the current Cambodian context in which cybersecurity is limited in infrastructure and human knowledge, security breaches should be the top priority It should be highlighted that Al still needs data, and Al is useless if the data is bad or contaminated by cybercriminals who might use the data to sell in the black market or for scamming purposes because the data is both marketable and profitable. In addition, increasing the use of big data and algorithms or artificial intelligence in general also means an increase in energy use which may hinder Cambodia's progress toward Goals  and . The latter is about taking action against climate change by regulating COz emissions, improving energy efficiency, and reducing fuel power consumption Even though Cambodia has almost achieved universal energy coverage, energy is mostly accessible among the urban population, while the rural population still finds it difficult to gain access to a stateprovided electrical power And without stable and sufficient energy Al might not be useful for rural development particularly in the agriculture and manufacturing industry, further engendering digital division between rural and urban areas. Al effects on the Reduced Inequalities Goal  is also questionable , for it is still an expensive technology since data is costly to collect and expertise in developing algorithms is hard to come by even for developed countries, let alone the developing one. As a result it is only affordable by the richer countries rather than the poorer nations, and that will exacerbate the current  day grid.  inequalities among countries, for the developed states tend to be the ones who can build exorbitant infrastructure to support Al expansion and application, and thus they are able to enjoy more benefits deriving from it In the case of an individual country such as Cambodia Al technology is likely to be able to afford only by the rich or major corporations, which tends to increase income inequality. Although Al might help boost productivity, the benefits might not really go towards the poor, creating an obvious two highly divided segments in a single society and thereby social issues It is suggested that a strong mechanism such as a progressive tax to counter the byproduct or externality of Al should be in placed first On top of that artificial intelligence is likely to place bluecollar workers on the brink of job loss and subsequently increase inequalities within a nation Brynjolfsson and Mcafee, . It is worth noting that workers need to have decent skills to operate Industry . technology which tends to reward educated individuals handsomely yet at the same time heavily punish lowskilled workers who conventionally come from a disadvantaged background This partially helps explain why there has been an increase in the wage gap between college and high school graduates in the United States Additionally, more automation is translated into less human labor. Hence, Al is likely to reduce demand for but increase the supply of manual workers, decrease their wages, and eventually transfer more wealth from workers to firm owners In Cambodia such a structural change in the economy can be detrimental considering that the vast majority of workers in the manufacturing industries, including the garment sector, are lIoWskilled young adults who are unlikely to utilise Al technology and hence prone to job displacement It is explicable that there is always a tradeoff between efficiency and equity, but there must be more winners than losers. And the losers should be compensated fairly. In this regard, a process to do so must be considered first before implementing Al technology to ensure that national technology advancement policies are not there only to enrich firms and employers otherwise, Alled economic development will lead to even more social challenges. Simply put it does more harm than good to society. With that said, a valid question should be asked is Cambodia ready? Cambodia's commitment to responsible innovation and research ethics provides a solid foundation for integrating Al ethics into its STI policy By balancing scientific progress with ethical considerations, Cambodia fosters integrity and social responsibility Upholding human security, addressing bias and discrimination, and promoting transparency and accountability are aspects of Al ethics that Cambodia towards a future where Al benefits society while safeguarding its values .. Skilling and Reskilling the Workforce in Cambodia Technology has been changing the nature of the workforce in all sectors, from small and medium sized enterprises SMEs to big industry, which lead the trends of the new jobs require the 21st century skills World Bank Group, . It is expected that by , nearly  million new jobs  key guide  will be created by using digital technology World Economic Forum . Emerging technologies such as cloud computing, big data, cyber security, immersive technology, game, Al, cobotics, Internet of Things loTs , Blockchain and 3D printing are likely to adopted by industries, businesses, health and wellbeing, agriculture and education in the future. It is reported that at least  of the tasks  of current occupations are at high risk, and  of the jobs the next generation will do in  do not exist Rethy et al,, . It is well recognised that there are no ways to tackle the 4th industrial revolution, especially jobloss issues without skilling and reskilling the Al workforce In this regard, it is very crucial for government and stakeholders to prepare the digital skill sets for the future labour force. According to Van Laar et al in , the 21st century digital skills are technical knowledge, information finding creativity and innovation, critical thinking, reasoning and complex problem solving, and interpersonal skills such as communication, collaboration, negotiation and teamwork With the industrial revolution ., countries around the world, as well as Cambodia have developed their own strategies and policies related to Al. STEM education policy was proposed to encourage students to go for STEM majors after their graduating from high school whereas technical and vocational education and training TVET policy and year Cambodia Digital Economy and Society Policy Framework were to promote technical and technology skill development Ratha and Phirom . Similarly to make the existing workforce survive and make it ready for those entering the workplace, the Cambodia's STI Roadmap  and policy focus on improving human capita in science and technology, especially Al in both quantity and quality, and gender equity. The current highly skilled workforce in Cambodia is still in low number which necessitate an education system reform to prepare in building modern skillsets for the future World Bank Group  . From the employer perspective, as shown in Figure 3 Skills in Cambodia Bruni et al  , the most major skill gap is foreign language skills, and practical skills Bruni et al. . In reskilling and upskilling for the human resource of the 21st century, all education levels need to adapt to Al Education curriculum which Al and digital literacy should have been introduced to our young people since their early age of study. Building up strong background for students in math English , critical thinking art, design, animation and coding is crucial in making pathway for them to step foot into the future modern skills Hor and Hesketh . In addition to the education reform, to strengthen the future skill sets, it is requiring the participants from all the stakeholders such as governments, universities, industries and societies. To ensure the workforces are ready to meet the future demands of the domestic and foreign labour market government should give priority to innovative research, STEM education, creativity, and critical thinking skills. Apart from Al and digital knowledge, emotional intelligent skills such as working as a team and communicating with other people are significant for the company well performing, productivity increment and collaborating with outsiders  yet ability , Gap  Foreign Language Skills .

Skills Gap in Cambodia Bruni et al,,  From the Al workshop 12th June  with all potential stakeholders , the finding indicated that Cambodian fresh graduates lack of both soft skills and hard skills Hor and Hesketh, . Universities neither transfer such knowledge to students, nor create educational situations for them to acquire these essential skills. In this regard, it was suggested that educational institutions should be in closely relationship with private firms to build good curriculum that match with industry demands With the partnership, students and teaching will have opportunity to expose themselves to the realworld problem and also staff of the industries can have chance to do research and upskill with the researchers from the universities. From the seminar discussion, to develop new skill sets and upskills for the future work force, there are some recommendations as following Establishing center of excellence to work on advanced technologies Building a collaboration framework for knowledge transfer between industries universities, government and young entrepreneurs Conducting regular knowledge sharing session through seminars and workshops Proposing strategy and policy to promote job skills for young people Creating research and innovation center within the universities Developing a directory of specialists Developing an Al policy Seeking for the source of fund for supporting research and innovation works Developing policy framework to captivate youth for new skillsets Skills, Data, and Multidisciplinary Knowledge Sharing are critical in Al development Table below shows the major skills and reskills required for different sectors   Three significant challenges that will be needed to exploit full potential of Al applications data collection and accessibility, interdisciplinary knowledge sharing framework, and shortage of talent who can improve Al capabilities, stimulate new ideas, and implement solutions To address the challenges, Cambodia can develop the following strategic pillars of Al i Centre of excellence for applied research, innovation, training and implementation, ii skilling and reskilling of Al and associated workforce with local and global institutional supports, ii data, knowledge sharing framework and digital infrastructure, iv GDPR, ethics, data privacy, security, V funding support for accelerating Al startups, research and innovations, and vi industrialisationcommercialisationldeployment of the Al enabled technologies.

Data Privacy, Ethic, Security and Regulations While Al promises a positive net benefit for society and economy, it also poses a great responsibility and risk when it comes to privacy, ethics, and security. As one may define Al, it is machine brain that accumulates learnings from data to create intelligence rather than rules explicitly codified by human programmers to perform tasks automatically The key here is that the decision is increasingly being made by machine rather than human as it is enabled by data computing resources, and advanced algorithms. Decisions made by Al could have consequences that affect fundamental rights and human beings. The question is to what extent Al decisions can be trustworthy, ethical and conformed to intrinsic human fundamental rights and values?  key  Overview of the Data Protection and Regulation in Cambodia Cambodia has not yet enacted any comprehensive data protection legislation. The first to the country's data protection landscape has come in the form of the ECommerce Law only available in Khmer , which contains provisions for the protection of consumer data that has been gathered over the course of electronic communication The ECommerce Law is thereby restricted in scope to virtual andlor digital data protection. Currently only few laws and regulations that express privacy and data protection include the Constitution, Civil Code, Laws on Telecommunications and the Press Laws. Ministry of Interior lawyers and data specialists chaired a meeting to discuss the first draft of a subdegree on the management use, privacy safeguard and security of data the governments have collected that can potentially be used to identify individuals on January , . On January , specialists from the ministry's Legislation Council and heads of the ministry's general directorates and departments discussed an initial draft comprising six chapters and  articles The purpose of this subdecree was to determine rules for the management, use and privacy protections for identifying data that would serve public interests, promote service provision quality and develop the nation in a highly efficient and secure manner Data Protection and Regulation Vision Cambodia seeks to harmonise among the existing laws and rights mentioned earlier for standardisation into a more targeted and specific data protection laws that governs sensitive personal data and its security needs across its lifespans in capture, storage, sharing use, and archive. Cambodia desires to balance risks and create conditions for a trustworthy Al sector to grow in a healthy, responsible and safe manner with initiatives to establish a national ethical framework committee body and data regulation laws conformed to the regional and international standards That way, principles and practices for unbiased use of Al are formed to promote fairness, ethics, inclusivity, transparency, and accountability so that citizens and businesses can adopt the use of Al in a protected and safe manner Cambodia recognises risks of heavy regulation seeing regulation may be too strict because it forfeit foreign investment in the technology sector especially so in a small country like Cambodia without sufficiently qualified human resources and technological advancement to manage data centres and security at the scale big tech firms are capable of. Cambodia and its citizens have to answer this question as We move into the digital economy why would large digital technology and manufacturing firms rather invest in Cambodia and not in Singapore or Vietnam? What competitive advantage and drivers do we exhibit relative to neighboring countries in attracting and  update may  retaining foreign investment? with an understanding that regulation in nature tends to de motivate innovation and slow down growth in exchange for a safer and fairer society as regulation increases compliance responsibility and constrains business behaviors to a set of social, ethical, and legal norms especially if poorly designed and implemented. Heavy regulation will likely hurt local digital businesses who emerge to cultivate innovation and experimentation to create new business lines and stimulate growth because they may not prepare to take administrative and compliant burdens while a lack of regulatory clarity injects fears of heavy fines that could destroy business startup and survival Having said that it is in the nation's interest to establish data protection laws to manage harms while providing regulatory clarity to guide businesses in ways of handing user data and consent, particularly user identifiable information such as name, date of birth, identity, and any other data objects that could reveal an individual identity. Importantly, the world has increased the level of sophistication in digitalisation that captures and processes data across multiple jurisdictions so data protection laws to provide regulatory clarity for crossborder data management and Cloud technology adoption guidelines will be established. Because unlawful and iIl intention usage of these data especially by bad actors cause harm to users, and therefore subject to legal responsibilities penalty and fines. In this effort, Cambodia looks to legislate data protection laws to make businesses and service providers accountable to the management, collection and usage of data in a responsible manner and nurture Al fields for maximum benefits with respect to foundational elements of human rights while promoting adoption for economic gains. Data Privacy and Ethics Article  of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights treats privacy as a distinct human right. Stated one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks In the Cambodian laws, it mentioned that citizens have rights to privacy Definitive meanings to what privacy are remains ambiguous and subject to legal interpretation. However, data privacy often refers to the rights to be left alone and rights to be free of independent thoughts Even So, privacy is a broad term that is essential to human dignity and autonomy for individual freedom Yet when conflicted with other laws, rights to privacy may be restricted under certain conditions like to protect national security and public safety. For example, in the matter of criminal offenses to protect public safety the state may authorise and require persons or entities to reveal one's individual identity without the needs of the user's consent who is under suspicion. In this regard to the privacy needs of citizens, Cambodia looks to establish a guideline to encourage organisations of all sizes to adopt privacybydesign approach to developing Al applications while the establishment of the National Committee of Ethics will champion the guidelines and direction for the incorporation of ethics and privacy for Al. Given how earlystage  Along no  Al is in Cambodia and for many organisations of all sizes, it may be impractical to copy and paste regulation requirements from the likes of European Union's General Data Protection Regulation GDPR A customised and localised standard data privacy and protection laws will be likely to align with the ASEAN regions. Basic elements like the collection of personal data shall have user consent and provide purpose information to such usages that protect user privacy and security. Individuals shall have rights to request, access, update, and remove at its user cost. Cambodia sees Al development conform to the ethical framework and social norms to ensure human values are protected, inclusion is encouraged, and fairness is preserved without systematic discrimination against humanity that causes perceptual bias and harms The discrimination may be classified into a category of race, gender, physical ability, and economic background. Right protection to equitable, just and fair treatment in society is a fundamental responsibility of the state when it comes to interrelation conflicts among individuals, businesses and government agents. However, it is the responsibilities of the organisations andlor goods and service providers that create Al applications and mismanage user data that affects one' ethical values Decisions made by Al applications that affect society's fundamental and ethical values shall be thought out by design and undergo a standard user and system acceptance test aimed at ensuring a Trustworthy Al. Critical decisions whether in health, credit loan, insurance claim, and employment shall provide reasonable explanations to support why such decisions are being made. When in doubt, humans should be in the loop to ensure Al decisions behave as expected and trusted And Al decisions are ethically sound and have a base of ethical foundation aligned to Cambodian constitutions and ethical framework Data Security Data security is the process of safeguarding data against unauthorised access and corruption throughout its lifespan from data collection, sharing usage, and deletion. With the growing risks of attacks and intrusion, organisations adopting Al at any scale shall invest to build cybersecurity capability in human resource and security technologies to govern, protect and manage its data assets Data security methods such as data encryption, hashing, and tokenisation are essential to the way data is safeguard and protected across all applications and platforms Because management of user data is ultimately the responsibility of good and service providers, security governance and checks shall be in place to protect user information from cyber security attack, leaks, scams, fraud, and loss. Risks of cyberthreats shall be studied, assessed and minimised at the organisation disposal. The intended or unintended consequences of poor management of data may cause various harms to users SO corporate organisations who handle large personal data especially related to personal finance and health shall be accountable and able to demonstrate compliance reporting The organisation shall have at least a minimum of one in charge of creating and mandating its data policy , security, and governance.  cyber key person  In general, Cambodia desires to establish data protection laws and guidelines to provide regulatory clarity for all data processes across its life spans and to protect users with regards to data privacy and ethics. Service providers shall adapt to a human rights bydesign approach to minimise unintentional or hidden biases, any discrimination or other negative consequences on individuals with respect to human rights and basic freedoms. The government of Cambodia aims to design a wellinformed regulatory framework consisting of best practices in the growing subject of Trustworthy Al, while emphasising the need of using Al in a fair, transparent accountable, and responsible manner. .. Strategic Investment for AlPowered Cambodia After a series of up, down and side turns, the development of Al technology has made great progress globally emerging from research labs into more socially useful and commercially viable technology applications that present massive opportunities for a modern economy and society. Some refers to Al impact and disruption from the change and technological innovation to the early days' invention of electricity, steam and water as well as the automobiles, computers and the internet today With billions of dollars expected to generate from Al globally, Cambodia sees the need and urgency to invest adopt and prepare for this Al global force in line with Industry . trend as the economy increasingly becomes knowledge and digital based. A strategic investment in the field of Al introduces three major pillars to maximise benefits and minimise risks in the facilitation of Al development for nationwide adoption, safety and sustainability Invest in people building the nation capacity for a resilient workforce, growth and innovation Invest in technological infrastructure building a robust foundation Invest in a collaborative tech ecosystem building a sustained network of value providers. These strategic views aim to drive Cambodia's competitiveness in the region and attract foreign investment As a small, growing nation rising from ashes, Cambodia is not in a position seeking to be a leader of Al in most domains but to strengthen its emerging role to contribute to the global economy as a hub for applied Al with young people talents to rapidly and innovatively prototype solutions to solve statelevel, societal and economic problems. An investment in human capital, digital infrastructure, and ecosystem development help Cambodia maximise at every stage of development and adoption, while RandD in niched areas are encouraged to be innovative and pioneering The investment in RandD also prevents critical adoption barriers and accelerates the use of Al for economic and societal benefits For example, without investing in the core Khmer NLP Cambodia cannot maximise its benefits from Al applications like  yet gains  conversational chatbot using Khmer and any others that build on top of NLP requiring the native language. Cambodia also aims to establish a data protection regulation to provide regulatory clarity and ensure accountability for a trust worth Al to flourish responsibly that is in line with ASEAN and international data protection laws as well as conforms to the established social norms within an ethical framework with respect to human rights. ... Invest in people building the nation capacity for a resilient workforce, growth and innovation This is in line with section .. Skilling and Reskilling the Workforce and the Rectangular Strategy IV from the Government of Cambodia. It looks to refine its positioning and competitiveness in the regional play Needless to say, Al will disrupt and impact labor employment categories, which require strategic initiatives to facilitate labor mobility, rapid skills building and upgrading skills transfers, and access to information. One of the greatest assets Cambodia has is its techsavvy young population, where almost twothird of the population is under  years old. More and more young people are equipped with English speaking ability which will serve the needs of digital knowledge workers in the new era and in the ASEAN Economic Integration for labour mobility and interaction By leveraging the rising young talented individuals and tech startup entrepreneurs to build Phnom Penh digital hub for innovative applications, technology and data talents, Cambodia is prepared in human resource development to achieve higher middleincome status by . People capability development is not only to build a homegrown young workforce sufficient to supply the country's economy but also the regional and international economy A number of factors are considerations when it comes to Al talent development ... Mindset and literacy The government of Cambodia recognises building capacity for the labor workforce is a longrun effort change management starts with mindset themselves, their family and institutions. The government aims to raise awareness and educate the population about the potential uses of Al, benefits, and its risks This introduction aims at raising the national average level of digital literacy around basic technology usage so all segments of citizens including disable persons, lowerincome group, female and elder can reap full benefits and not be digitally excluded As Al becomes more prevalent, relationships between humans and machines will also need to develop and strengthen for a safe, knowledgeable, and growing society. Digital literacy programs around Al and STEM education will be campaigned and promoted targeting  the general population  parents for their confidence in job prospects of their kids' decision to enter STEM education  youths themselves to be aware and access information as they make informed educational decisions The government will also look into policy design for promoting the demand side for Al and digital talents to power their institutions in both private and public sector such as tax credits for workforce training, and in particular act as the publicprivate collaboration and protection  key Any  enabler to increase private sectors' incentives for maximum impact and reduce frictional risks for a striving digital economy. All initiatives will be to ensure digital mindset literacy, and attitude toward Al are well received and cover both the supply and demand side when it comes to human resource planning and development. ... STEM graduates strong and growing economy highly correlates with STEM education as it serves to build labor forces to fill needs from the private and public sector More importantly, with the applications of Al, STEM workers will need to think, build, operate, and maintain Al. Critical preconditions like this for the Al sector to flourish in Cambodia will be explored, assessed and acted upon to build a robust local talent pool in the field and overtime change the dynamic of foreign talent dependencies. Cambodia has made and continues to level up its effort to increase the number of STEM graduates per year working with the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport and in building early age interests of children toward STEM education, ensuring a sizable enrollment and minimal drop out in universities across city and provinces later on With the recognition of the needs for practical lab and applied studies, Cambodia aims to foster and promote publicprivate partnerships such as employers and education institutions to establish internship standards that mutually benefit both the students and organisations. This effort is intended to establish educational and employment Iinks and create more chances of success, for example with government sponsored local and international internship programs in the STEM areas which will be shared, promoted and standardised. Sending students abroad for STEM internships will give them practical experience and exposure to the international work environment and standards while keeping brain drain incheck Collectively it drives international competitiveness for employment opportunities when it comes to quality talents for local and international employers. Along with productivity gains expected for the economy with STEM graduates, their income is also expected to rise drastically into a new income bracket thus leveling up a multigenerational, socioeconomic impact to them, families and society ... TVET graduates Beyond a STEM degree program, a new TVET education focusing on ICT are welcomed and promoted to complement university degree standards. Companies expect graduates to come with soft and technical skills that reflect the changing nature of industry and technology so require a rapidly evolving and regularly updated curriculum for quality teaching and practical excellence. A number of classroomtocareer institutions will be promoted to provide shortterm, high skills, industryrelevant technology training to meet the rapid needs from private sector organisations and SMEs Cambodia aims to support these specific skills development programs especially in   the digital and technology fields such as but not limited to computer training, Al, software engineering, blockchain, robotics, data science, computer programming, and security ... Lifelong learning for upskill and reskill workforce In addition to these above education standards, Cambodia looks to develop lifelong learning opportunities in its efforts to upskill and reskill both private and public sector staff. Cambodia intends to explore eskill credits where individuals can apply and use the credits with thirdparty providers to receive the training developing their resilient adaptation to the inevitable force of automation and preparing for new job category creation by AI. Overall the lifelong learning initiatives will increase citizen professional growth opportunities for better employment and higher income while boosting the nation's productivity. The impact of job loss and creation due to Al will be carefully studied in the context of Cambodia and plan initiatives for rapid upskill and reskilling implementation programs working with key multistakeholders including international development organisations and training providers. Cambodia has witnessed the impact of Covid19 pandemic that destroyed byandlarge the tourism sector that the economy has largely depended on. This major source of income powering the economy has been depleted with great uncertainty moving into the postcovid era Garment manufacturing sector, which has also significantly contributed to Cambodia's GDP, is another area greatly vulnerable to the global development of Al, hightech investment and automation It is a national concern that has been shared among ministries and development partners Having said that Cambodia works proactively to take calculated risks, minimise the expected damage, and cultivate opportunities that Al will create such as through the upskill and reskill efforts to ensure a positive net impact from AI ... Invest in technological infrastructure building for a robust foundation Digital infrastructure is the backbone of a thriving economy for the internet era A strong digital foundation is essential to maximise the benefits at scale with minimal security risks for vibrant and safe technological development in society ... Connectivity and telecommunication Cambodia enjoys a high mobile and broadband penetration rate Telecommunication services are provided with nationalwide network coverage at affordable prices for customerspartly thanks to a regulatory environment that fosters market competition among mobile operators. Advancement in telecommunication technology such as the introduction of 5G infrastructure and fastspeed fiber optic will also further increase the nation's connectivity. While a high penetration rate of mobile phones and connectivity coverage is well acknowledged, Cambodia government will continue a regulatory environment that promotes investments to better telecommunications  cyber key  networks and services that support Al research, applications and usage. Particularly it aims to boost connectivity infrastructure further and promote publicprivate partnerships among hardware manufacturers, internet service providers and interested economic actors to increase household access and affordability for available hardware devices and fastspeed, high quality internet connection thus increasing citizen participation in the digital economy and reap potential benefits ... Digital and data infrastructure In line with the .. Data and Digital Infrastructure section, strategic investment into building a robust data and digital infrastructure ensures Cambodia facilitates the development of the Al sector. Al RandD requires storage and computing resources to be utilised in a collaborative, safe and secure manner. Cambodia will support the digital infrastructure architecture with high performance physical servers and software in preparation for the country's ambition toward a digital economy and create a digital sandbox for innovation and collaboration among private sectors and research institutions to prototype solutions to societal and commercial applications of AI. Cambodia aims to develop a national data center facility to manage computing, data storage and network services to ensure smooth operation. Initiatives will also be taken around boosting the quality and access of the highperformant internet, computer network, security system, data center, social media, software, mobile and web applications ... Invest in the emerging technologies Cambodia government embraces digital technologies as we ve seen in the industry . agenda for egovernment adoption at the statelevel because it believes ICTs enable innovation for the country and not stifle it. The gap between the current pace of global technological development and adoption ability in Cambodia is increasingly widened for many areas only a few niches where we are noticeably recognised as early adopters These niches can be said for the case of the Bakong blockchainbased technology system by the National Bank of Cambodia as among the first central banks in the world to deploy such revolutionary tech. The technology facilitates the settlement among financial institutions and lowers the cost of intercooperation for all endusers thus increasing financial access and inclusion. Another case can be said for the IDPoor on demand digital system and graph database by the Ministry of Planning working with development partners such as Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH and Australian Aid to better social registry and social protection with targeted assistance provision to the right poor households These technologies are newly adopted in Cambodia and have not been done at the same scope or scale before but have shown great promise, feasibility and nationlevel impact thus for the digital ambition that Cambodia strives to achieve will require investment into testing newly emerged technologies, fostering a culture of trialanderror experimentation with more collaborative RandD institutions, and building a knowhow absorptive  Any key  ability for the nation to scale up the implementation efforts. Some examples of these emerging technologies include distributed big data storage with HadoopSpark for a single source of identity information decentralised applications with blockchain around ownership rights and data traceability with a security standard, Internet of Things such as drones and robotics to better agricultural output, digital platforms for eservices to increase citizen and business participation, cloud computing integration technologies with regulatory clarity and feasibility assessment to enable business organisations' accessibility for the world's powerful technological infrastructure and platforms to increase their productivity output per unit cost of production ... Invest in a collaborative tech ecosystem building an ecosystem for a sustained network of value providers Cambodia has the opportunity to achieve economic, security, and social gains in the Al sector for many domains Yet it lacks key enabled and supported areas. For example, for ecommerce to function in the economy, which has taken a long time until it is being adopted more widely now in its growth acceleration partly thanks to the ecommerce law enacted in , it requires not only the digital marketplace for buyers and sellers, but also logistics, digital payment and customer protection that facilitates it. It is nearly impossible for any individual business to build every aspect at the same time thus relying on an ecosystem of various economic actors in the provision of products and services. The Cambodian government has made big steps and is committed to promote a robust collaborative ecosystem to increase overall benefits and reduce collaboration cost for the ecosystem actors One area is in the promotion of a vibrant startup ecosystem and tech hub supported by a local and international collaboration For example, the coinvestment initiatives with private institutional investors increases access to finance for startup and SME entrepreneurs with Khmer Enterprise's Entrepreneurship Fund by the Ministry of Economic and Finance. It also brings a wellknown global VC Startup  through its international collaboration and local corporations' partners to nurture the startup ecosystem Tech entrepreneurship is demonstrated as a career path option which is actively promoted in addition to STEM workers Cambodia encourages economic activities and initiatives that drive the next generation of digital businesses and startups that use digital and Al technologies through national award, grants, and investment. .. Research and Innovation This section explores the state of the art of research landscape in Cambodia about Al. More importantly, the innovative aspect of the knowledge from Al research will be discussed in the context At this point it is important to root the term innovation viewed by Charpie in  . He emphasised that innovation is made if five steps are made which includes basic invention from ideas ideation , engineering design micro piloting , manufacturing industrial scale ,   manufacturing startup making a startup, and market diffusion generating profit . Al will be ubiquitous in our daily life in next decade, especially in decision making process, improving workflow and efficiency, health care, education, and financial sector For instance, it is suggested that Al capacity will surely add value to the efficiency and accuracy of clinicians Thomas et al,, . Data will be the driving for Al development Internet users are the main contributor of data for Al. The materialisation of Al stock of Al knowledge for economic purposes is an innovation approach. Contextually , Cambodia requires strategic investment in the field if the kingdom wishes to unleash the potential of Al for socioeconomic development Some important investment could be financing, infrastructure development talent development and supportive regulatory framework Three types of data are being collected for Al, which are identity data, network data, and behavior data Ma . Identity Data refers to data of individual, entity, or identity or information characteristic to identify a person or institution. Network data refers to data of location from direct input to any application or usage of any particular application. Behavior data refers to data that users browse in websites, social media, Apps or in other application interfaces The three data are the important resources for Al. A triple helix model of market driven research on Al could be reiterated most of the discussion The world is facing the rapid accumulation of knowledge on Al, while private sector is harnessing the potential of the field However consequences and various potential risks arising from this development has posed a great attention among policy makers and academic researchers, while private sector is in concern stage to materialise the development Likewise, Cambodia is experiencing the rapid development of Al in the last decades The pool of knowledge in the field is growing fast in way that is unpredictable from user perspective. Practically, academia is seen to have challenges in coping with the demand of private sectors in the field. This rapid development and application of the field in industrylservices results in great attentions as well to policy makers Government regulator has generally acknowledged the significance of Al in economic development, but privacy, security, ethics, and value are the major concern After all it is necessary that Al landscape in Cambodia could be well understood prior to incentivise or regulate the development of the domain ... Scholarly publication From academic point of view Cambodia has seen the importance of investment in Al development. Some nascent publication of Al by Cambodian scholars seems to be since . For instance, the first algorithm on swarm intelligence published Hul et al,, 2007a Hul et al,, 2007b Seingheng et al., Tan et al., . The work was published focusing mainly on water reuselrecycle in industrial sector However, it seems no much progress in scholarly work despite that the work   has great attentional in the later stage. Supper power economic drive like China, European Union, and United States has started to invest drastically in the research and development of Al from that time. The number of peerreviewed paper and patents on Al has increased significantly in the last decade. Most of the papers are coming from higher education institutions The number of Al publication including journal articles, conference papers, repositories, patents, book chapters, book thesis, and others are show below. The number of Al publication is seen more than two folds in the last ten years The report by Center for Security and Emerging Technology in  appears that journal papers share . of all Al scholar documents published Pattern recognition contributed more than other fields of machine learning, computer vision, algorithm, data mining natural language processing, human computer interaction, control theory, and linguistics.  .         L               Figure . Al publication trends in the last ten years Center for Security and Emerging Technology,  Al publication by sector shows that education predominate in the last ten years, while China shares largest number of publication and citation about Al. The huge contribution of Al knowledge from China could be attributed to large amount of data from users and the government policy to support the Al development in the country In addition, hundreds of companies are opening up on Al investment.   ., Education      J  ., Unknown ., Nonprofit  ., Company ., Government             Figure . Publication by sectors in the last ten years Center for Security and Emerging Technology,  Trends has commonly understood that Aldriven technologies are expected to be the stimulus for economic growth. Likewise, Cambodia values the importance of Al application as well. However adoption, implementation and incentivised system are not sufficient enough from academic studies in Cambodia society S. Heng et al,, . Scholars put an importance debate on value of Al on economic development. Some suggested that Alenabled technologies for economic development in emerging growth nations could not simply happen until there is proper ecosystem. The foundation to adopt and adapt Al technologies for developing economy could be scientificlengineeringbased education, sufficient infrastructure, favorable technology transfer mechanism and others Sayogo et al,, . Further investment on Alenabled technologies in education sector was also suggested P. . One of the first academic events was conducted entitled st annual forum on Al Human intelligence in augmented era' with the aim to promote the field and its application. The event was arranged by Institute of Technology of Cambodia and Cambodia Development Resource Institute. Then the forum was not made possible due to disruption of Covid. Finally, this important event was continued to commence again entitled 2nd annual forum Al for Society on August ,  at Cambodia University of Technology and Science in collaboration with Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology Innovation This forum is organised to academia private sectors, government, civil societies, and other relevant stakeholders to discuss the current development of Al, its future trends, and opportunities and challenges up ahead that Cambodia should prepare itself for if it decides to fully embrace such technology The forum has five main objectives Provide a platform for the representatives from the government industries and academia to discuss express, and exchange ideas on the Al landscape and its impacts on society  Heng bring  Raise public awareness of the significance , opportunities benefits and challenges of Al applications Formulate policy suggestions and recommendations for promoting and strengthening the development of Industry . technologies in general, Al in particular Promote multistakeholder collaboration for knowledge mobilisation and development of artificial intelligence in Cambodia Disseminate the results of research studies on Artificial Intelligence Landscape in Cambodia ... Al Demand The application of Al is necessarily incorporated in industry and related public services. There is a need in synergising efforts from all stakeholders. An investment in Al for research universities is important On the other hand, the private sector and public institutions could bring actual Al enabled technologies to fit the demand for research universities Research and innovation ecosystem of Al in the countries could be suggested as fellow S. et al., . University level Required motived and qualified researchers on Al, intra and inter collaboration among researchers and institutions, lessening redundancy work, Joint research efforts Private sector level Setting up task force, using casedriven approaches, solution driven adoption process Government level Required funding for research and development, clear approaches and strategy, centralisation of the Al activities Coordinating underlies foundation the Al research and development Existing policy such as National policy on STI , Cambodia's STI roadmap , Cambodia Digital Economy and Society Policy framework , could be some of legal instruments to unleash the potential of Al for useful purposes. Breaking the silo among all stakeholders is the immediate actions to ensure that Al ecosystem is connected for socioeconomic development of the nation National council of science, technology and innovation is the big umbrella serving as platform to accommodate stakeholders .. Potential Al applications for different sectors ... Service Over the last few decades, the number of internet users increase rapidly over the world wide web. In the current era of internet large amount of data has been generated every day whenever you are watching TV, using social media, doing online shopping and communication As the speed of internet access is getting incredibly faster from endtoend users the new advance technologies  Heng  such as loTs, Big data analytics, Al, have been possibly introduced to better benefit the human life. Due to this reason, numerous of companies seek to adopt these advance technologies to create more creative services from day to day to their end user. This process could be possible by collecting and analysing the data generated from the past experience of their customers and, thus, it could deliver the related services according to their interests and needs Let's take a look on how the Al technology has the impact on everyday life as following a Retail and Ecommerce With the development of the ecommerce, the scale of online retail is becoming larger and larger Within the variety of product categories and changeable customer demand, it is a very big challenge for the sale volume prediction In the modern Al is applied to tackle the aforementioned problems Chen in  proposed an online retail prediction using machine learning called AGALSTM Neural Network. The adaptive genetic algorithm is applied while the building of neural network to optimised the training time and prediction accuracy. As a result, the method could forecast the sale volume of goods in a very large and complicated ecommerce. b Online Advertising In the world of the digital marketing, many companies try to improve their business strategy by promoting and diversifying their products and services via many methods and one of the promising one is online advertising The problem is how does the company actually know about which ads the customer is interested in. In fact Al is already there to solve this problem. Normally , most of the website have implemented the tracking code to keep log file of browsing behavior of individual Neumann, . This information is shared across different companies and, thus, the historic behavior about the user interest of which site you visit or which product you looked at were being captured. During this process, Al is used to match the users to the corresponding ads based on the analysing of this historic behavior C Customer Support Customer support is the very effective way used in any company to help the customer when thing goes wrong eg, when user want to know detail about the way the use the product properly, would call and ask Traditionally, most companies spend a lot of moneys to create customer service department as the prompt and accurate response to a request is very essential for customer retention and satisfaction Molino et al,, . Yet this procedure could lead to change of worker practices as the users expect to ask for time availability of the information about their orders or to answer a very simple questions such as why is my internet connection dead Hardalov et al,, . Many of Al application have been proposed such as voice recognition , sentimental analysis Kaur, , etc, in order to understand the customer's question and give  day, they  the accurate response e.g , nowadays, people are most likely to use Alexa, Siri or google assistance for online shopping controlling home devices etc. ... Manufacturing Manufacturing sector has played an important role for the country by contributing to employment growth, national security, sustainable development which improve the economic potential and GDP of the country With the emerging technologies such as intercommunication loT, CPS, smart visualisation and decision making Al, Big data, Cloud Computing and Cyber security it has enabled the transformation of the manufacturing in terms of the model approach and its ecosystem. The life cycle of manufacturing in the new era requires a lot of processes and technologies. Generally, the procedure uses the autonomous sensing interconnection, decision making, control, and the execution of human machine, material, and environment information to integrate and optimise various aspects of manufacturing Therefore, it would help to facilitate the production and to produce high efficiency and quality , costeffective, environment friendly for users, and to improve the competitiveness in the manufacturing market. In addition Qu et al.,  , the evolution of smart manufacturing is not only to develop new technology, but one must also define the requirements of stakeholders and the model of innovative business. Technically, this process would help get realtime data to improve the accuracy of decisionmaking in the supply process Mass Customisation , enhance the efficiency and performance of the production line process plant automation , minimise the used resources raw material , waste management and increase the overall productivity. Al, which is computer system able to perform task that generally mimic to the human intelligence, is one of the main key drivers in this change as it would help in forwarding the sustainable development Buchmeister et al., . Thus, Al is a very important factor to transform the traditional manufacturing into advance and smart manufacturing in the context of fourth industrial revolution. a Smart Warehouse management system Traditionally warehouse is used to store the manufactured products from one or many places and deliver them to the company customer. Due to the rapid increasing amounts of orders in the modern day, the distribution process in the warehouse is getting more complicated and led to the birth of the smart warehouse management system. According to study there are five main steps in the complete product distribution process which consists in planning, receiving and put away, location management, order picking and packing, and transport and tracking By introducing Al concept, each step can be analysed and optimised separately Zunic et al,, . Study by Pulungan et al. in  provides some brief discussions on the practical implementation of artificial intelligent into warehouse management system. The research mentioned on to use new technologies such as bee colony optimisation, fussy controlling, extreme learning machine along the Radio Frequency Identification. All of the aforementioned technologies are used to  flow how  enable the intelligent logistic system, intelligent warehouse system, realtime transportation monitoring system, sales forecasting system and intelligent sales summary system Pulungan et al., . b Manufacturing Production Since the beginning of the industrial revolution . I4. , many countries have already address it as modern challenge in various fields especially in the advance industrial manufacturing Kagermann et al, . This transformation of advanced industrial manufacturing could be made through digitalisation and exploitation of new advanced technology such as selflearning and selfadapting cyber physical system CPS , loTs, cloud computing and Al. Their primary goal is to address the need of modern production system with higher efficiency and lower cost throughout the process so that it could meet new demand in the modern market To tackle the problems, numerous of enterprises have already investigated and implemented by using all of these aforementioned technologies. To be competitive under the paradigm of ., a company must production planning and control PPC able to respond to disturbance Cadavid et al,, . Normally, PPC can be defined as the required quantity in the plant production to meet profitability, productivity and ontime delivery To satisfy the requirement the author introduce the Al technology by using text mining to estimate the production inhibition time and machine learning techniques to create the dynamic production schedule in the production line. On the other hand, the aim of smart manufacturing is to achieve highly flexible and automate in the production process Hsieh et al,, . The use case of the paper is to detect the anomaly of production line in smart manufacturing by using the collected data from the sensing device They introduce a new Al algorithm called unsupervised realtime anomaly detection based on LSTMbased Auto Encoder . ... Mobility and Transportation Mobility and transportation are known as the backbones of the modern economy and function in one country to become intelligent They are a driven force to promote economic growth, enhance the accessibility of the labor market strengthen the logistics supply chain, and open up new markets for enterprises due to their linkages to other sectors. According to the Japan International Cooperation Agency report on the modernisation of vehicle registration in , the number of registered vehicles and motorcycles has increased exponentially. The growth rate in  was approximately . This growth leads to primary emissions, then the smart moves of the mobility and transportation sector must be required to achieve environmental sustainability and a new mobility ecosystem.   New mobility and transportation technologies currently take Al as the significant perspective, transforming conventional transportation into intelligent transportation The potential Al applications on mobility and transportation can be enabled as follows, a Advanced driver assistance systems and automated driving systems this autonomous technology can enable vehicles, trains, roads, and other infrastructure to communicate with computers, smartphones, or other devices via wireless technologies Al capabilities can help increase safety, reliability, and hauling efficiency. For example, autonomous driving systems are designed to offer drivers some functions such as monitoring warning braking, and steering functions The potential of Al can be analysed to predict the end ofthe queue to generate a queue warning message to allow the vehicle to take action b Cybersecurity Al is built in cybersecurity to provide high security of technologies applied in modern transportation to achieve efficient operations and prevent any thread interruption. Precisely, those automated systems that connected vehicles, devices, and infrastructure operating together are needed to embed Al technology to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the systems by identifying the threadslmalware, preventing the damage resources C Accessible transportation This system uses Al to support all travelers, including the elderly or people with disabilities The system consists of many target functions related to transportation, such as pretrip planning, wayfinding and navigation, surface street crossing, and navigating the complex road. In addition, the auto curb ramp system is also installed in the vehicle or other transportation as an assistant to help the disabled and older adults. Al can also promote reliability and safety execute one travel to all links in the travel chain to make it easy for users to access d Traveler decision support tools The potential Alenabled applications provide adequate monitoring information to process passenger requests weatherlpricing information , predict the roadway arrival times, and other valuable functions such as planning trips For instance, the transportation system managers can also use the information in the system to support decisionmaking Transportation systems management and operations The optimisation of multimodal infrastructure systems using Al is built to perform realtime and dynamic service systems to improve the transportation system. Decisionmaking is also considered in this management system to control the work zone, traffic incident, road weather , or other traffic signals  cyber  f . Commercial vehicle and freight operations Al is embedded to address the operation and movement of vehicle and freight management systems. For example, Al is applied in asset tracking, cargo status monitoring, freight optimisation, freight signals, etc , to ensure management efficiency and safety g Transit operations and management This system uses Al to perform the management operations, maintenance, and security to respond to many services, including maintenance forecasting event detection, dynamic itinerary planning, and service allocation This system helps the user monitor and select the service to apply for transit vehicles h Emergency management This is a particular system that uses Al to build the alert agency system to address public transportation safety management The system covers the necessary alerts, such as policies, fire, and emergency medical. Air traffic management To optimise air traffic pathway management, Al needs to use the available data to generalise the pathway and provide realtime visualisation of the traffic management system. J Remote sensing Drone and uncrewed aerial vehicles have functioned as intelligent remote sensing which uses Al to monitor and control the traffic, bridge inspections, aerial mapping incident management, and transportation infrastructure. k Asset management and roadway construction and maintenance This system focus on the strategic and systematic process of operating, maintaining, and improving physical assets by using Al application. The prediction of Al can identify a structured sequence of maintenance, preservation, rehabilitation and replacement actions that requires taking action at a minimum feasible cost. In summary there are four system functions enabled by Al in the mobility and transportation sector Sense and perceive the environment Reason and analyse information Learn from the experience and adapt to new situations Make decisions, communicate, and take actions. The Alenable application is checked with four maturity levels concept RandD, prototype or minimum viable product and production. Consequently, there are three aspects of Alenabled application The increased levels of comfort and convenience   The prospect of vastly improved safety through autonomous driving The macro benefits to the environment e.g, potential reduction of emissions and society e.g , potential optimisation of traffic less required parking space in city centers ... Agriculture The agricultural sector is one of Cambodia's  roadmap priorities for technology development options. Besides, agriculture had gained  percent of Cambodias GDP and employed about  million people in , according to a report by the US Embassy in Cambodia Currently, agriculture technology has rapidly transformed to use advanced machinery and internet of thing technology to analyse and enhance production efficiency. The potential Al applications in the agriculture sector can provide into six categories a Agricultural production management Al is enabled in the agricultural production management system to provide information about crop rotation planning, planting time consumption, water and nutrient management pests and fertilisers and management, disease control, optimal harvest food marketing product distribution food safety, and food supply chain tasks b Agricultural production management Al is enabled in the agricultural production management system to provide information about crop rotation planning, planting time consumption, water and nutrient management pests and fertilisers and management, disease control, optimal harvest food marketing, product distribution, food safety, and food supply chain tasks C Crop monitoring This system applies Al to monitor and identify crop health issues, soil nutrients, weather conditions, irrigation, and other functions that maximise crop revenue. The Alenabled application provides visual instruction and quickly understands soil health, plant pests, and plant disease d Data science The agriculture information is stored at all data points every day for further analysis For example, weather conditions, temperature, irrigation, and soil conditions data are collected from the farm to enable an Al model to predict the plant condition whether it will produce high quality or not. Realtime data provides a better understanding of the health of plants and optimise natural resources. This approach produces agroecosystem dynamics under changing environmental conditions Disease detection The Alenabled tool is applied to provide the earlywarning system to prevent disease outbreaks and spotting insectslanimals in the area of plants Al can also trigger the sensor to take action to protect the plant  flow,  f . Food quality Food safety and quality assurance use Al as a critical role to perform most human tasks to check the plant g Predictive analytics potential Al application is performed as data analysis to help farmers protect the land quality , reduce water irrigation, and determine the amount of crop harvested The prediction is expected to increase the profitability for each field while reducing the environmental impact of pesticides and fertiliser In summary, Al will drive the agricultural revolution to an intelligent agricultural ecosystem and sustainability. ... Education Throughout the ages, countries have seen the profound impact of education on their quality of life Psacharopoulos and Patrinos . With that in mind, nothing could be more transformative than providing consistent highquality education across Cambodia's population. And these promising advancements are actually more possible than ever through the use of artificial intelligence with its adaptive algorithms As a matter of fact this new technology is already being used in many classrooms around the world and online to help facilitate learning through virtual and individualised educational platforms And given how respected teachers currently are in Cambodia improving teachers' impact has become a top priority for Cambodian leadership. After all, today's students will become tomorrow's leaders that will advance Cambodia's future. Cambodian culture values hard work dedication, and family all of which make for students that are capable of many amasing accomplishments. However given the financial, geographic, and demographic constraints, providing quality education has been a challenge. That being said, AI and its direct application to facilitate learning has the potential to transform Cambodia's education system and substantially raise the quality of life for millions of citizens. In the future, this technology will facilitate the implementation of standardised learning in which the lessons for each student will be based on their capabilities and hard work, not on the limitations of their geographic situation But delivering on these promises requires focused planning and execution by the leadership of Cambodia Currently however, Al in education is far from the envisioned science fiction avatar that seamlessly interacts with young students. As things are now, Al remains in the nascent stages of development Still, many scholars believe that there will be comprehensive educational applications that work directly with students. These applications will understand what each student needs providing lessons that focus on what exactly the student must focus on to reach the next educational milestone.  The  Far before the previously mentioned avatar begins teaching our children, educators will be relying on Al to facilitate the traditional classroom setting In fact, most current applications of Al in the classroom help teachers understand where students need specialised lessons or individualised training Al is helping teachers build Smart Content automate tutoring, grade tests, and categorise learning difficulties This saves time for the teachers, allowing them to focus on the more substantial aspects of teaching such as lesson planning and student engagement e.g Al in Education Faggella . modern examples of Al in education have emerged in countries all over the world. One notable example is China's initiative called Education Informatisation . Digital First Education' One of the first initiatives in this program was to upgrade the curriculum by improving the availability of resources for teachers. To this end, they built a shared resource platform which makes teachers more productive by providing a well organised digital space for resources that have been collected from all over the country e.g Education Informatisation . in China Motivation, Framework, and Vision, an exploration into Innovative Practices of Targeted Poverty Reduction Through Education using Information Technology Yan and Yang . Artificial Intelligence will have a similar impact on most other industries as well. Additionally, the technology itself is an industry that will provide many opportunities for students that are capable of learning how to use these new tools. Some examples include deep learning statistical analysis and robotics. Cambodian students will undoubtedly have a distinct advantage in using these new technologies This will in turn help Cambodia realise the educational promise of artificial intelligence. ... Finance and Trade Cambodia's GDP growth rate has been extremely stable over time and is now the sixth fastest growing economy in the world What is unique about this growth is that it has been steady for over  years See GDP Chart The World Economic Forum has reported that only  economies worldwide have provided this level of stable growth. This is a sign of resilience and consistency in the country It is also a sign that Cambodia has the discipline and drive to implement new solutions and technological innovations regularly. And artificial intelligence will be yet another solution that helps Cambodia thrive in the future World Economic Forum, .  Many   , .  .  .  .  .  .   . .

Cambodia's GDP capacity during last decade World Bank,  As the economy emerges and takes off it is imperative that its financial sector continues facilitating investment flow while domestic credits pick up. Given such opportunities, Al technology would find its place in effectively accelerating financial inclusion through its machinelearning innovations that enable more accessible and defaultfree credit models 1onon 00n Note This charts will be redone by The art tcam.  4nnn z00n     SOURCE TRADINGECONOMICSCOM NATIONAL BANK OF CAMBODIA Figure  . Cambodia's export behavior Trade is a major reason for why Cambodia's GDP growth has had such sustained development. Improving trade is directly correlated with improving the economy in Cambodia The better the trade, the better the economy And artificial intelligence has much to offer when it comes to bettering trade and remaining competitive in tomorrow's international market. As the chart shows, exports are continuing to rise with apparel, footwear, and leather goods being the major drivers of growth. A continued focus on these exports and experimenting with new exports will help   Cambodia thrive in already fertile markets such as the USA, China, and Germany as shown in figure above. Al provides many opportunities for efficiency and growth in the world market For example, the implementation of Al for language translation in ecommerce has been shown to produce more than  growth in online international trade sales Brynjolfsson et al., . And there are other such examples in which Al tools are capable of managing compliance despite the numerous complexities between suppliers, clients , and shifting trade restrictions Without Al, many industries rely on mere human intervention to constantly check for errors However by using Al, the system can learn how to handle these problems more efficiently and accurately, which in turn allows for a more seamless compliance operation. United Belgium Vietnam United States China Kingdom . . .. Netherlands  Thailand Spain France Japan . ... . South . Canada Italy . . . Hong Kong Incia Russia . United  Germany . Poland Ireland  Australia . Gabon . Singapore  Figure . Cambodia export by contry Al is also making a significant contribution by optimising the supply chain The significant lead time required for many supply operations can derail trade operations by causing a myriad of time delays, especially when there are complex multipart orders. The ordering of one part might mean the ordering of sixty different other parts, all with different lead times. Getting ahead of these orders is to delivering your products on time similarly significant capability of this technology is the implementation of Al based smart contracts. This is where the legal contract is essentially broken down into computer code in which business rules are implemented, which then allows Al to avoid any costly mistakes while reducing manual checking These factors all lead to easier access to trade and financing because the business investors are more confident in a process that they can measure and trust As more countries continue to implement Al for international trade, the compatibility of such technology across different countries would mean better communication, efficiency, and fairness in international dealings. For example, a smaller country might feel more comfortable in a deal in  key  which all of its factors are being considered and intentionally maximised in discussions with larger countries that have more resources. And wealthier countries will have the chance to better international relations and improve the quality of life in smaller countries with Al handling the nuances for both sides The overall benefits of implementing Al in negotiations are that each side can move faster have deeper confidence, and feel more comfortable with the outcomes The is having a system that each party can trust and that can illuminate alternatives that might have otherwise been unthought of by both sides Hone, . This is how Al becomes sewn into the fabric of international trade. And while it does not completely replace the process or the people, it is still implemented in almost every component, delivering an improved trading operation These improvements will be realised right to the bottom line in Cambodia, thereby driving the GDP to even higher levels Nesbitt  ... Healthcare and Medicine Healthcare is one of the most important areas for the use of Al. Cambodia has already begun working with companies that utilise various levels of diagnostic technologies embedded with Al. For example, CARA has tools that help diagnose eye and cardiovascular disease in Cambodia This is just the beginning Artificial intelligence has the capability for use in almost every area of healthcare from diagnostics, surgery, operational efficiencies, and population disease projection analytics Davenport and Kalakota, . Future opportunities include smart hospitals where equipment and infrastructure are embedded with contact sensors that bring a hospital's architecture to a level of ambient intelligence. These tools have provided new levels of protection for clinical professionals and safety for patients by interpreting their surroundings and gathering additional relevant data for clinicians Standford University, . The development of such artificial intelligence in healthcare has undergone many evolutions In the early 80s, logic systems consisting of ifthenelse statements and massive rulesbase engineering were defined as a type of intelligence However, diagnostic professionals found these tools to be overwhelmingly complex and difficult to manage. One of the primary challenges was keeping the current knowledge base uptodate, especially if the recommendation engine was providing dosage calculations Also, rule engines typically consisted of hundreds and thousands of statements, all of which were largely errorprone and hardly classifiable in today's modern AI engines Davenport and Kalakota . The potential for artificial intelligence in healthcare Most of today's Al technology is based on neural networks and deep learning Such technology allows machines to perform tasks without specifically being programmed to do so. In this way, computers can learn from data and perform tasks in a more humanfriendly way AII kinds of problems are being efficiently handled by Al in the medical field. For instance, the massive amount of data doctors has to analyse when diagnosing a patient is typically colossal.  key  Health records are spread across multiple systems and do not follow any standard protocol. But Al tools bring all of the data together then these tools analyse the structured and unstructured results to produce probabilistic diagnostics that can help the doctor quickly identify a potential illness In addition to diagnostics, artificial intelligence is also becoming common in treatment recommendations and avoiding medical errors With the massive amount of data available each year, it is difficult or impossible for all clinical professionals to be uptodate on the potential treatment regimens for uncommon diagnoses. An empirical explaining this medical challenge has been done using modern machinelearning algorithms in the Cambodian Children's hospital Oonsivilai et al,,. This study focused on the patient's antibiotic susceptibility based on patientspecific predictions. The result from the study outperformed the logistic regression models and has proved itself to be very beneficial when it comes to issuing prescriptions since it can prevent the inappropriate overuse of antibiotics, thereby reducing the patient's resistance to antibiotic treatment Every year more medical articles are produced than could ever be read by one person. In  nearly  million scientific articles were published, and that trend has grown  every year Chi . Furthermore, it has been well documented that patient allergy management dangerous drugtodrug interactions, and dealing with other complex medical conditions have yielded a risky environment for patients But Al tools can quickly digest the latest articles and recalculate potential treatment plans almost instantaneously This helps safeguard patients by providing clinicians with focused, uncluttered information. Al is also being used to help clinical professionals more accurately and effectively identify medical treatments with the best probability of success For example, IBM Watson reads the patient's medical record and then determines the likelihood of a stroke, it then provides the potential success of a variety of different treatments IBM, . Surgical robots have also been assisting clinicians for decades But recently these robots are being embedded with AI This is largely seen in common surgeries such as gynecologic and prostate procedures. Such technology helps the surgeon focus on more complex matters while removing much of the basic logistics of the operation Davenport and Kalakota, . Surgeons are also using Al to help keep track of all the relevant factors in their decisionmaking These factors include the values and emotions of the patient, case complexity, individual judgment and time constraints. Bringing Al tools into the surgical decisionmaking process helps clarify all the factors of these decisions within an objective framework Patients thereby end up with a better outcome when both human and automated decisionmaking come together over their surgical procedures Loftus et al,, .  study  .. Challenges Al is currently used extensively in commercial applications like targeting advertisements, search optimisation, customer service, healthcare, transportation, and the robotic applications that have been previously explained in this article. The basic technological principles for implementing these systems have been around for decades, but the computational power and clean data necessary to implement these ideas have only recently become feasible. The most promising aspect of this implementation is supervised learning This provides the foundation for many of the most practical examples of Al in business McKinsey Global Institute, . However, there are many challenges and concerns that come with the use of Al. Certainly, machine learning requires massive amounts of data and computing time. Researchers are generally challenged when it comes to finding highquality, unbiased training sets to teach AI. In many cases, hundreds of thousands, if not millions of records are required to properly implement deep learning algorithms. And data sets containing biased information can lead to undesirable results Most algorithms and data sets need to be tuned to the appropriate objective and all algorithms need to be tested to make sure the results are correct and appropriate. Every effort should be made for data to be stored in a usable format and be well documented so it can be appropriately applied in a learning model. Data manipulation alone is one of the most expensive and time consuming parts of any Al project. There are other cultural challenges to consider that branch out into new issues for leadership when it comes to incorporating Al. A cautious yet experimental mindset is necessary for this new technology enterprise to be successful. Errors are natural and even helpful for our understanding Although sometimes the cost in time and money might increase, it should still be considered a milestone for progress Governments and companies hoping to use Al also need to focus on innovation, critical thinking, and STEM in their educational system External subject matter experts will certainly be able to help with data formatting and processing algorithms However , experts who understand the underlying data and principles of how the information might be best used are in a position to maximise the impact and profitability of this new technology Mackinsey Global Institute ,  In addition to the challenges faced by leadership, data quality, and bias, is also held back by computing power and infrastructure Specifically, Al implementation is hampered by the lack of available talent and intellectually skilled practitioners, not to mention financing In many areas funding is not available to test applications or even to provide the time to consider how these new solutions might be applied. In the short term, this research takes time and money. But in the run the potential benefits will far outweigh the investment Mackinsey Global Institute, .  key AI long  there has been much written about how Al will take jobs away from unskilled or easily automated workers. This can especially be seen in Cambodia where industries are still labor intensive An  and have low economyofscale in terms of market size. This means that most of these industries would not allow Cambodian businesses to afford advanced automated and robotic machines that are made available by Al technology This typically leads to hesitation to invest and experiment with Al However Al brings other opportunities, especially in the early stages of transition One example in education involves the potential confusion between the student and the Al program's design The implementation of Al based learning systems in China for example, required the hiring of hundreds of tutors to help students during the implementation of their lessons And  of these positions were filled by women who would have otherwise gone unemployed Xinxin et al,, . The transition to Al for a country or a company will not be simple and seamless There are and will be advances in some areas and challenges in others The foundation of Al demands hard work in infrastructure and normal Information as well as Communication Technology ICT But Cambodia has already been implementing a plan to fortify these fundamental infrastructure components SEAN and LOR, . There have been many famous examples that show how Al can make errors and provide misleading answers during this transition. One famous example is Google's GFE, which is short for Google Flu Trends' It was an experimental tool that was intended to predict flu outbreaks in the United States. Initial results seemed promising but unfortunately, it was determined that the data was unreliable in its predictions and the project was terminated Other examples include the Microsoft Chat Bot that was making sexist and racist statements. It was shut down within  hours of operation There was also the Amazon Al hiring blunder where selections that had been in use for years were clearly biased None of these errors negate the fact that Al is a powerful technology that is here to stay. Improvements in the algorithms and data sets will undoubtedly drive positive performance in the future Tennery and Cherelus, . Healthcare diagnostics and procedural processes with Al have also been successfully deployed However, widespread use of Al to displace caregivers is unlikely in the shortterm, and perhaps in the long term. This is because of the tremendous shortage in clinical professionals in Cambodia and around the world. Additionally, Al is seen as a diagnostic helper, but will probably never be a tool to deliver a diagnosis. Patients tend to prefer facetoface dialogue around their diagnoses and potential treatment options. Therefore although Al can be extremely helpful and even necessary to ease the burden of clinical diagnostics, it will not be a replacement Davenport Kalakota . In many situations the output and associated logical explanation of Al has not been made clear For example, educational Al has been struggling to build models that allow students to learn in  Also,  steps It has been well documented that porting curriculum content into usable Albased frameworks is challenging and expensive. Also, identifying laddering technologies that serve to identify students' level of understanding has additional complexities. For example, a student that understands to do addition but struggles with multiplication naturally needs specific, individualised attention in multiplication. This requires lessons to be linked in a sophisticated manner that is machine readable and integrated across curriculums Implementing a 'knowledge tree' for such students involves an efficient network of lessons that require advanced skills, an indepth knowledge of databases, and a solid understanding of the interplay within such systems to see how the Al model will respond to the sum total of its overall usage. Fortunately, there are many working examples of well planned and executed Al based learning engines. One example is the system implemented in China to help nonnative speakers learn Mandarin. The system has an Albased engine that engages the students and determines their level of comprehension. Then it continuously adjusts their experience to maximise understanding Students using this system have shown significantly improved test results Xinxin et al,,. Cybersecurity and confidentiality are also major challenges for Al, particularly when the information is clinical or financially related The implementation of Al also raises confidentiality and intellectual property IP issues. Training data often needs to be copied and edited for use, which may lead to a certain degree of vulnerability With that in mind, cybersecurity should be a completely integral part of every Al project in order to properly consider the necessary protocols for safety, security , and protecting intellectual property, as well as safeguarding personal information. Regular testing and audits are required to ensure a safe and secure environment Furthermore, proper data governance, threat detection, and legal review should be fundamental to any technological project Oseni et al,, . In Cambodia this technology is not just about Al. It is about creating a digital framework within the existing infrastructure to implement its learning capability alongside the work of Information and Communication Technology ICT. A relevant legal framework on data and cybersecurity is also needed to be in force to combat cybercrimes and to also provide assurance to relevant businesses, practitioners, and consumers in the field Infrastructure is the and there is already a basic technological foundation that Cambodia has been building for years that will be leveraged to maximise the impact of Al in education SEAN and LOR, . Recently, the Royal Government of Cambodia has put forth in its Cambodia Digital Economy and Society Policy Framework  specific measures within the short and medium term of its plan to boost investment in infrastructure and the application of Al in data governance, particularly in data use and analysis Royal Government of Cambodia, . However , to effectively use Al, an environment of experimentation and innovation is necessary Basic  how key  research and prototyping are required. But proper leadership and guidance for such objectives are also necessary to purposely direct this technology in a way that solves real problems for Cambodia technological projects have suffered from weak leadership and misguided objectives But constant measurement, objective evaluation, and experimenting with potential solutions are necessary in avoiding such issues The current reality of Al is undoubtedly promising And the truth is that Al is already producing positive results that are used daily in business, clinical, and mechanical settings Far from magic, the technology is mathintensive and requires highly skilled professionals for planning implementation, assessment, and continuous monitoringteedback to ensure appropriate results. And while the initial stages of development are errorprone, the daily use of successfully implemented Al platforms is simple and extremely reliable. Even nOW, Al continues to prove its worth despite the challenges of its development But that being said, the most important key to its success is good leadership that realises the undeniable benefits Al has in store for Cambodia. 6 Al for Cambodia Policy framework and options Artificial Intelligence Al is one of the essential technologies in the world game changing in every sector to improve productivity, efficiency, and costeffectiveness. In order to foster trustworthy Al ecosystems, it is essential for countries to develop humancentered policies that promote socio economic and responsible Al research and development This includes policies that encourage investment in such initiatives These policies of Al development should take into account its national development vision as well as regional and global trends The country's objectives preferences, and overarching strategy for Al advancement in both immediate and distant future should be clarified. Initially, the main objective is to cultivate skilled personnel and employ Al solutions to deal with critical national focus areas that will have a swift impact on Cambodia's socioeconomic status Over time , the priority should shift to developing fundamental and advanced research promoting highlevel Al research and innovation, and establishing Cambodia's standing in advanced technology on a global scale To reach this goal, here are some policy recommendations for Cambodia . . Define National Focus Areas Cambodia has experienced a significant increase in internet users as part of its pursuit to become digital nation. These users employ the internet for various reasons such as entertainment work, and business growth. Consequently, innovative technologies like loTs, Big data analytics, and AI are increasingly becoming prevalent in Cambodia's daily activities. To maximize this technological advancement Cambodia should prioritize the utilization of Al in developmental sectors These sectors should be carefully selected to ensure that they align with the country's overall development goals. The recommendations areas should include  Many key key  Service for SME with the rapid growth of internet users, many businesses are eager to adopt advanced technologies that can enhance customer experiences and drive business growth. One way to achieve this is by collecting and analyzing data from customers' past experiences, which can help companies deliver relevant services based on their preferences and needs To leverage these technologies effectively, the policies should focus on areas such as retail and ecommerce, online advertising and customer support Manufacturing the of Cambodia's GDP has been significantly influenced by its manufacturing sector. To further enhance productivity and costeffectiveness in manufacturing and keep up with the fourth industrial revolution implementation of Al can help transform traditional manufacturing into advanced and smart manufacturing This, in turn will enable Cambodia to compete effectively in regional and global markets, leading to positive socioeconomic progress The integration of technology in manufacturing can involve realtime data collection through loT, automation processes using robotics, and improved daily operations and decisionmaking through information systems and AI Mobility and Transportation transportation and mobility is a significant factor in stimulating economic growth, improving market accessibility, strengthening logistics supply chains, and creating new opportunities for businesses by connecting different sectors. Introducing Al to improve the efficiency and accessibility of transportation and mobility can aid Cambodia in achieving its environmental sustainability, road safety, and socioeconomic objectives. To effectively implement Al in transportation, it is crucial to focus on improving transport accessibility, management and operation systems, emergency response management security measures, and roadway maintenance and management Agriculture in , agriculture contributed  to Cambodia's GDP and provided employment opportunities to around  million individuals. With the advancements in technology, the agricultural sector has rapidly evolved and incorporated sophisticated machinery and internet of things technology to enhance production efficiency. Given that Cambodia is primarily an agriculturalbased country, the implementation of Al for enhancing agricultural productivity is imperative The potential applications of Al in agriculture include managing production monitoring crop growth, analyzing data and making informed decisions, detecting diseases, monitoring food quality and safety, and conducting predictive analysis. Education providing consistent highquality education to its citizens will a significant impact on both people's lifestyles, wellbeing and the country's economic growth. In today's digital age, Al and other technologies have revolutionized the way we teach and learn. Despite potential challenges, these applications offer immense  key growth bring  benefits for transforming education. However, since technology accessibility is still limited in some regions of Cambodia due to socioeconomic and geographic factors Therefore , to maximize the of Al in education requires improving three main strategies  improve digital infrastructure and funding to accessibility to technology for every student  providing clear national policies and guidelines on the implementation of Al in teaching and learning activities, and  using technology to make learning contents accessible to all students regardless of their location. Finance and Trade in order for Cambodia's economy to continue its growth trajectory, it is crucial that the financial sector keeps facilitating investment flow while also supporting domestic credits. The country's sustained development in terms of GDP growth can be attributed to trade which plays a significant role in boosting the economy Therefore, enhancing trade is directly linked to improving the overall economy of Cambodia. In this context leveraging the potential of artificial intelligence can prove to be advantageous in terms of enhancing finance, trade and maintaining competitiveness in the global market of the future Al tools can be implemented in finance and trend analysis to enhance various aspects of businesses such as international trade through automatic language translation, ensuring compliance with regulations, providing efficient customer support, creating customer profiles for targeted marketing optimizing the supply chain management and executing smart contracts. Healthcare access to highquality healthcare is crucial for the overall wellbeing and development of a country, and it should be a top priority in every nation's development goals. Artificial intelligence Al is playing an increasingly important role in healthcare worldwide, and Cambodia is already working with companies that use Alpowered diagnostic technologies The potential applications of Al in healthcare are vast, from diagnostics and surgery to operational efficiencies and population disease projection analytics and prediction To prevent medical errors, Cambodia should consider implementing smart hospitals where technology is integrated into equipment infrastructure, and processes to enhance diagnosis and treatment Tourism Tourism is a significant contributor to Cambodia's economy with around . million domestic and . million international tourists visiting in  prior to the Covid  pandemic. However in , only . million international visitors were recorded, highlighting the impact of the pandemic on travel Therefore, it has become essential to utilize technology as a means to enhance tourism activities and help the industry recover. .. Develop a National Al Regulation and Guidelines Al has the potential to bring numerous benefits to society and the economy, but it also carries significant risks and responsibilities, particularly regarding privacy, ethics, and security.  profit  To ensure that Al applications prioritize humancentered benefits, Cambodia must develop regulations and guidelines by a multiministries committee The committee shall consist of the Ministry of Industry, Science , Technology and Innovation Ministry of Post and Telecommunication and Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport This new regulation and guidelines require harmonizing existing laws and creating new data protection laws that govern sensitive personal information throughout its lifecycle, from capture to storage, sharing, use, and archiving To safeguard citizens' privacy, organizations of all sizes including academia should adopt a privacybydesign approach to developing Al applicationslalgorithms The multiministries committee should also oversee the proper incorporation of ethics and privacy measures in Al development to ensure compliance with best practices .. Develop a National Al Infrastructure In order for Al to be fully utilized, it is crucial to have a strong infrastructure that supports the development and implementation of Al systems This infrastructure should be initiated by the government with the support from private industries and academia. This infrastructure shall be used to support students, researchers, universities, and industries in their pursuit of Al innovation It shall consider various components such as hardware, software, data, and human resources that are necessary for the research and deployment of Al solutions Essential components of this infrastructure may include highperformance computing systems, cloudbased platforms for data storage and processing, and opensource AI frameworks and libraries .. Promote in Al Research, Innovation, Education and Talent development The future is expected to see the integration of emerging technologies such as big data, cloud computing cyber security, data science, Al, robotics, 3D printing Blockchain, and Internet of Things loTs across various industries including businesses, healthcare, agriculture, and education Talent and skill development Cambodia faces a shortage of highly skilled workers in these areas, which highlights the need for educational reforms to equip students with modern skill sets that align with the demands of the future labor market In addition, one of drawback when using Al is job displacement To tackle this challenge, the government can prioritize and support talent and skill development initiatives. These could be   Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport shall encourage educational institutions to provide specialize course for talent and skill development Ministry of Economics shall allocate skill development budget to support such initiatives Companies can invest in training their workers with the necessary skills Educational Institutions can play the role of trainer to provide necessary training to companies Developing Al Research Culture for sustainable benefits and human capital development, Cambodia should also encourage Al research and innovation activities. This may include Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport shall provide incentives and fund for Al research and innovation This incentive and fund shall be classified into  categories Research fundamental to support initiatives of researchers and academia Innovation research to support applied research that are potential for commercialization. This research shall be the cooperation between educational institutions and industries Flagship project to support longterm and impactful research projects. This kind of project shall consist of educational institutions, industrial and international organizations .. Develop AI Ecosystem To achieve sustainable and inclusive growth, Cambodia's development strategy should prioritize investing more in Al research innovation, and entrepreneurship. This can be accomplished by Creating an Al ecosystem that fosters collaboration beyond just cooperation among stakeholders Use the quadruple helix paradigm to involves academics, government, industrial and societies to ensure social equality , minimize perpetuate biases and pose privacy risks Develop a national strategy to encourage business collaboration This may include The Ministry of Economic shall consider funding budgets to support publicprivate partnerships research and innovation knowledge transfer and commercialization on appliedAl projects. Governments should also consider policies such as tax reductions or incentives for industries investing in Al research and innovation Such policies will encourage industry to invest in research and development build innovative applications, and generate job opportunities   Encourage collaboration between industry and educational institutions. Academia can contribute research expertise, train talent, and facilitate knowledge transfer to industry .. Foster International Collaborations Global collaboration and swift policy actions are essential in the marketdriven field of Al. For Cambodia to remain competitive on the stage, it is crucial to cultivate worldclass talent through various strategies The first step is to identify skill gaps in education, research, and innovation. Then, offer attractive scholarships and incentives for Cambodian individuals to study abroad and fill these gaps. The scholarship source can be funding by Government through budget planning organized by Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport Industry funding International cooperation and cofunding Secondly Cambodia needs to establish its own research platform to facilitate knowledge sharing and promote research activities amongst Cambodian researchers, ultimately improving the quality of research in the country and creating opportunities for international partnerships Lastly, implementing a special grant package that encourages regional and international collaboration will help to advance Al research and innovation in Cambodia and elevate Cambodia's research quality to an international level.  global  References An I.

MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  FOREWORD In , the world saw significant advances in the sophistication and pervasive use of artificial intelligence Al. For instance, we witnessed the emergence of nextgeneration Alpowered natural text generators like GPT, which can generate passages that are difficult to distinguish from human writing We also saw the development of Dactyl, a robotic hand, which uses reinforcement learning to grasp and manipulate common household objects with humanlike dexterity These examples attest to the of Al's advancement and how it will become ubiquitous in our daily lives. The discourse on Al ethics and governance has also moved forward. Over the last two years, governments and international organisations have begun issuing principles, frameworks and recommendations on Al ethics and governance. In January , Singapore launched our Model Al Governance Framework Model Framework at the World Economic Forum in Davos The Model Frameworks unique contribution to the global discourse on Al ethics lies in translating ethical principles into practical recommendations that organisations could readily adopt to deploy Al responsibly We are heartened by the diversity of organisations that have adopted the practices outlined in the Model Framework, which underscores its easeofuse and relevance. Singapore is to launch the second edition of the Model Framework. This edition incorporates the experiences of organisations thathave adopted Al, and feedback from our participation in leading international platforms, such as the European Commission's HighLevel Expert Group and the OECD Expert Group on Al. Such input has enabled us to provide clearer and effective guidance for organisations to implement Al responsibly speed proud   Singapore's Infocommunications Media Development Authority IMDA and Personal Data Protection Commission PDPC have also partnered the World Economic Forum Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution to develop an Implementation and SelfAssessment Guide for Organisations ISAGO. The ISAGO complements the Model Framework by allowing organisations to assess the alignment of their Al governance practices with the Model Framework, while providing useful industry examples and practices. We are also publishing a Compendium of Use Cases, which features real world examples of how organisations have implemented or aligned their Al governance practices with the Model Framework. Together these initiatives enable any organisation to establish and refine its Al governance practices in concrete and practical ways. These initiatives play a critical role in Singapores National Al Strategy epitomise our plans to develop a humancentric approach towards Al governance that builds and sustains trust. also reflect our emphasis on cocreating an Al ecosystem in a collaborative and inclusive manner The Model Framework and ISAGO will pave the way for future developments, such as the training of professionals on ethical Al deployment and laying the groundwork for Singapore, and the world, to better address Als impact on society The steps we take today will leave an indelible imprint on our collective future. The Model Framework has been recognised as a firm foundation for the responsible use of Al and its future evolution. We will build on this momentum to advance a humancentric approach to Al one that facilitates innovation and safeguards trust to ensure Al's positive impact on the world for generations to come. S Iswaran Minister for Communications and Information Singapore January  They public They public  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  . PREAMBLE   . The Model Framework focuses primarily on four broad areas internal governance structures and measures, human involvement in Alaugmented decisionmaking, operations management and stakeholder interaction and communication. While the Model Framework is certainly not limited in ambition, it is ultimately limited by form, purpose and practical considerations of scope. With that in mind, several caveats bear mentioning The Model Framework is a Algorithmagnostic It does not focus on Al or data analytics methodology It applies to the design, application and use of Al in general. b. Technologyagnostic It does not focus on systems, software or technology and will apply regardless of development language and data storage method Sectoragnostic It serves as a baseline set of considerations and measures for organisations operating in any sector to adopt Specific sectors or organisations may choose to include additional considerations and measures or adapt this baseline set to meet their needs. The PDPC encourages and will collaborate with agencies adapting the Model Framework for their sectors. d. Scale and Businessmodelagnostic It does not focus on organisations of a particular scale or size. It can also be used by organisations engaging in businesstobusiness or businesstoconsumer activities and operations, or in any other business model. specific specific public  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  . It is recognised that there are a number of issues that are closely interrelated to the ethical use and deployment of Al. This Model Framework does not focus on these specific issues, which are often sufficient in scope to warrant separate study and treatment Examples of these issues include a Articulating a new set of ethical principles for AI. There are already a number of attempts globally in establishing a universal set of principles. While a consistent core set of ethical principles is emerging, there is also a penumbra of variation across cultures, jurisdictions and industry sectors. The Model Framework uses existing and common Al ethical principles a compilation of which is set out in Annex A and converts them into implementable practices. b. Providing model frameworks and addressing issues around data sharing, whether between the and private sectors or between organisations or within consortia. There are a number of guides that are relevant, such as the IMDA's Trusted Data Sharing Framework and the Guide to Data Valuation for Data Sharing Discussing issues relating to the legal liabilities associated with Al, intellectual property rights, and societal impacts of Al on employment competition, unequal access to Al products and services by different segments of society, Al technologies falling into hands of wrong people , etc These issues are nevertheless pertinent and can be separately through platforms such as the Centre for Al and Data Governance established in the Singapore Management University School of Law public e.g explored   . INTRODUCTION  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  OBJECTIVES . The exponential growth in data and computing power has fuelled the advancement of datadriven technologies such as AI. Al can be used by organisations to provide new and services, boost productivity, enhance competitiveness, ultimately leading to economic growth and a better quality of life. As with any new technology, however Al also introduces new ethical, legal and governance challenges These include risks of unintended discrimination potentially leading to unfair outcomes, as well as issues relating to consumers' knowledge abouthow Al is involved in making significant or sensitive decisions about them . The PDPC,' with advice from the Advisory Council, proposes this second edition of the and voluntary Model Framework as a general, readytouse tool to enable organisations that are deploying Al solutions at scale to do so in a responsible manner This Model Framework is not intended for organisations that are deploying updated commercial offtheshelf software packages that happen to now incorporate Al in their feature set . This voluntary Model Framework provides guidance on the issues to be considered and measures that can be implemented. Adopting this Model Framework will require tailoring the measures to address the risks identified for the implementing organisation. The Model Framework is intended to assist organisations to achieve the following objectives a Build stakeholder confidence in Al through organisations' responsible use of Al to manage different risks in Al deployment b Demonstrate reasonable efforts to align internal policies, structures and processes with relevant accountabilitybased practices in data management and protection e.g the Personal Data Protection Act  PDPA and the OECD Privacy Principles. Under section  of Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act ,the IMDA is designated as the PDPC goods living key   . To assist organisations in implementing the Model Framework, the PDPC has also prepared a complementary ISAGO. The ISAGO helps organisations assess the alignment of their Al governance practices and processes with the Model Framework It also provides additional useful industry references and examples that further clarify the recommendations set out in this Model Framework . The extent to which organisations adopt the recommendations in this Model Framework depends on several factors, including the nature and complexity of the Al used by organisations, the extent to which Al is employed in the organisations' decision making, and the severity and probability of the impact of the autonomous decision on individuals. . To elaborate Al technologies may be used to augment a human decisionmaker or to autonomously make a decision For instance, the impact of an autonomous decision in medical diagnosis is arguably greater than that in a product recommendation The commercial risks of Al deployment is therefore proportionate to the impact on individuals. Generally, where the cost of implementing Al technologies in an ethical manner outweighs the expected benefits, organisations should consider whether alternative nonAlsolutions should be adopted The considerations and recommendations set out in this Framework are intended to guide organisations that have decided to deploy AI technologies at scale.  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  GUIDING PRINCIPLES . The Model Framework is based on two highlevel guiding principles that promote trust in Al and understanding ofthe use of Al technologies a Organisations Al in decisionmaking should ensure thatthe decisionmaking process is explainable , transparent and fair. Although perfect explainability, transparency and fairness are impossible to attain, organisations should strive to ensure that their use or application of Al is undertaken in a manner that reflects the objectives of these principles as far as possible. This helps build trust and confidence in AI b. Al solutions should be humancentric. As Al is used to amplify human capabilities, the protection ofthe interests of human beings, including their wellbeing and should be the primary considerations in the design, development and deployment of AI Organisations should ensure that Al decisionmaking processes are explainable, transparent and fair while Al solutions should be humancentric using safety,   . Like other technologies, Al aims to increase human productivity However unlike earlier technologies, some aspects of autonomous predictions or decisions made by Al may not be fully explainable As Al technologies can make decisions that affect individuals, or have a significant impact on society, markets or economies, organisations should consider this Model Framework to their deployment of AI. . Organisations should detail a set of ethical principles when embark on deployment of Al at scale within their processes or to empower their products andor services. Where necessary, organisations may wish to refer to the compilation of Al ethical principles in Annex A As far as possible, organisations should also review their existing corporate values and incorporate the ethical principles that have articulated Some of the ethical principles e.g safety may be articulated as risks that can be incorporated into the corporate risk management framework The Model Framework is designed to assist organisations incorporating ethical principles into familiar and preexisting corporate governance structures, and thereby aid in guiding the adoption of Al in an organisation using guide they they by  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  ASSUMPTIONS . The Model Framework aims to discuss good data management practices in general. The Model Framework is mainly applicable to machine learning models as compared to pure decision treedriven Al models. . The Model Framework does not address the risk of catastrophic failure due to cyberattacks on an organisation heavily dependent on Al. Organisations remain responsible for ensuring the availability, reliability, quality and safety of their products and services, regardless of whether Al technologies are used . Adopting this voluntary Model Framework will not absolve organisations from compliance with current laws and regulations However as this is an accountabilitybased framework, adopting it will assist organisations in demonstrating that had implemented accountabilitybased practices in data management and protection, eg the PDPA and OECD Privacy Principles . Further it should be noted that certain industry sectors such as in the finance, healthcare, and legal sectors may be regulated by existing sectorspecific laws, regulations or guidelines relevant to the sector For example, the Monetary Authority of Singapore published the Principles to Promote Fairness, Ethics, Accountability and Transparency in the Use of Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics in Singapore's Financial Sector the FEAT Principles to provide guidance to firms that use Al and data analytics to offer financial products and services.? Organisations are advised to remain mindful of such laws, regulations and guidelines, as adopting the Model Framework does not mean that organisations are in compliance with such sectorspecific laws, regulations or guidelines Monetary Authority of Singapore, Principles to Promote Fairness, Ethics, Accountability and Transparency FEAT in the Use of Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics in Singapore's Financial Sector'  November   . they   DEFINITIONS F . The following simplified diagram depicts the stakeholders in an Al adoption process discussed in the Model Framework The adoption process does not distinguish between business toconsumer B2C, businesstobusiness B2B , and business tobusinesstoconsumer B2BZC relationships Al Solution Providers Organisations Individuals . Some terms used in Al may have different definitions depending on context and use. The definitions of some terms used in this Model Framework are as follows refers to a set of technologies that seek to simulate human Al traits such as knowledge, reasoning, problem solving, perception learning and planning, and, depending on the Al model, produce an output or decision such as a prediction, recommendation, andor classification Al technologies rely on Al algorithms to generate models. The most appropriate models isare selected and deployed in a production system. Al Solution develop Al solutions or application systems that make Providers use of Al technology These include not just commercial offtheshelf products, online services, mobile applications, and other software that consumers can use directly, but also B2BZC applications, e.g Alpowered fraud detection software sold to financial institutions. also include device and equipment manufacturers that integrate Alpowered features into their products, and those whose solutions are not standalone products but are meant to be integrated into a final product Some organisations develop their own Al solutions and can be their own solution providers. Organisations refers to companies or other entities that adopt or deploy Al solutions in their operations, such as backroom operations processing applications for loans , frontofhouse services e.g ecommerce portal or ridehailing app , or the sale or distribution of devices that provide Alpowered features e.g smart home appliances. Individuals can, depending on the context, refer to persons to whom organisations intend to supply Al products andor services, or persons who have already purchased the Al products andor services These may be referred to as consumers or customers' as well This definition of Al was adapted from various sources, and contextualised accordingly for the purposes of this Model Framework. It should not be taken to be an authoritative or exhaustive definition. key key They e.g  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK      . MODEL AI GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK   MODEL AI GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK . This Model Framework comprises guidance on measures promoting the responsible use of Al that organisations should adopt in the following areas a Internal governance structures and measures Adapting existing or setting up internal governance structure and measures to incorporate values, risks, and responsibilities relating to algorithmic decisionmaking b Determining the level of human involvement in Alaugmented decisionmaking A methodology to aid organisations in setting its risk appetite for use of Al, i.e. determining acceptable risks and identifying an appropriate level of human involvement in Alaugmented decisionmaking C Operations management Issues to be considered when developing, selecting and maintaining Al models, including data management d. Stakeholder interaction and communication Strategies for communicating with an organisation's stakeholders , and the management of relationships with them . Organisations adopting this Model Framework may find that not all elements are relevant This Model Framework is meant to be flexible, and organisations can adapt the Model Framework to suit their needs and adopting those elements that are relevant . To help organisations better understand the Model Framework, we have included in each section illustrations demonstrating how realworld companies have implemented certain practices described in that section. In addition, the PDPC has also released a Compendium of Use Cases that illustrates how various local and international organisations have put in place Al governance practices that are aligned to all sections of the Model Framework. key specific  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  INTERNAL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES AND MEASURES . This section is intended to organisations in developing appropriate internal governance structures that allow organisations to have appropriate oversight over how AI technologies are brought into their operations andor products and services. . Internal governance structures and measures help to ensure robust oversight over an organisation's use of AI. The organisation's existing internal governance structures can be adapted, andlor new structures can be implemented if necessary For example, risks associated with the use of Al can be managed within the enterprise risk management structure, while ethical considerations can be introduced as corporate values and managed through ethics review boards or similar structures Ethical considerations can be introduced as corporate values and managed through ethics review boards or similar structures. . Organisations may also consider determining the appropriate features in their internal governance structures. For example, when relying completely on a centralised governance mechanism is not optimal, a decentralised one could be considered to incorporate ethical considerations into daytoday decision making at the operational level, if necessary The sponsorship, support and participation of the organisation's top management and its board of directors in the organisation's Al governance are crucial guide   . Organisations may wish to consider including features that are relevant to the development of their internal governance structure, such as  Clear roles and responsibilities for the ethical deployment of AI a Responsibility for and oversight of the various stages and activities involved in Al deployment should be allocated to the appropriate personnel andor departments. If necessary and possible, consider establishing a coordinating body, having relevant expertise and proper representation from across the organisation b Personnel andlor departments having internal Al governance functions should be fully aware of their roles and responsibilities, be properly trained, and be provided with the resources and guidance needed for them to discharge their duties. C roles and responsibilities that can be allocated include L. Using any existing risk management framework and applying risk control measures see Risk management and internal controls' below to Assess and manage the risks of deploying Al, including any potential adverse impact on the individuals who are most vulnerable, how are impacted, how to assess the scale of the impact, how to get feedback from those impacted, etc  Decide on the appropriate level of human involvement in Alaugmented decisionmaking Manage the Al model training and selection process Key e.g they  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  ii. Maintenance, monitoring, documentation and review of the Al models that have been deployed, with a view to taking remediation measures where needed. Mi. Reviewing communications channels and interactions with stakeholders to provide disclosure and effective feedback channels. iv. Ensuring relevant staff dealing with Al systems are properly trained. Where applicable and necessary, staff who are working and interacting directly with Al models may need to be trained to interpret Al model output and decisions and to detect and manage bias in data Other staff whose work deals with the Al system e.g a customer relationship officer answering customer queries about the Al system, or a salesperson using an Alenabled product to make a recommendation should be trained to be at least aware of and sensitive to the benefits, risks and limitations when using Al, so that they know when to alert subjectmatter experts within their organisations   . Risk management and internal controls a Organisations can consider implementing a sound system of risk management and internal controls that specifically addresses the risks involved in the deployment of the selected Al model. b Such measures include Using reasonable efforts to ensure that the datasets used for Al model training are adequate for the intended purpose, and to assess and manage the risks of inaccuracy or bias, as well as reviewing exceptions identified during model training Virtually, no dataset is completely unbiased. Organisations should strive to understand the ways in which datasets may be biased and address this in their safety measures and deployment strategies ii. Establishing monitoring and reporting systems as well as processes to ensure that the appropriate level of management is aware of the performance of and other issues relating to the deployed AI. Where appropriate, the monitoring can include autonomous monitoring to effectively scale human oversight Al systems can be designed to report on the confidence level of their predictions, and explainability features could focus on why the Al model had a certain level of confidence. Mii. Ensuring proper knowledge transfer whenever there are changes in personnel involved in AI activities. This will reduce the risk of staff movement creating a gap in internal governance. iv. Reviewing the internal governance structure and measures when there are significant changes to organisational structure or personnel involved. V Periodically reviewing the internal governance structure and measures to ensure their continued relevance and effectiveness key key  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  CUJO Al ILLUSTRATION ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES AND MEASURES CUJO Al is a network intelligence software company in the telecommunications operators' market Headquartered in the US, it seeks to develop and deploy Al toimprove security, control, privacy of connected devices in homes and businesses CUJO Al has implemented clear internal governance structures and measures to ensure robust oversight of its use of Al. Its multistakeholder governance structures facilitate decisions at appropriate levels Research Board consisting of the Chief Technology Officer the Head of Labs and the Chief Data Scientist, approves the Al development and deployment In particular the Chief Technology Officer oversees four technical teams which consists of more than  employees. Their roles and responsibilities are clearly defined a Research team performs data analysis, research and develop Machine Learning ML models and Al algorithms b Engineering team builds software, cloud services and applications Operation team deploys the Al model and upgrade platform and d. Delivery team engages with operators and integrate services. An Architecture consisting of the Chief Technology Officer Chief Steering Group Architect Officer and lead engineers, ensures the ASG robustness of the AIML models before deployment The ASG has biweekly meetings where the research team shares its findings on the ML models and Al algorithms data, approach and assumptions oversee the Al development and deployment PhDlevel employees process, and strive to implement academic review standards for each new feature development In addition, CUJO Al has developed a general Code of Ethics Code for its employees. All new employees are introduced to the CUJO Al local country document and process repository For example CUJO Als office in Finland provides its employees with an electronic CUJO employee handbook The handbook describes in detail the Code while covering other topics such as business ethics and conduct Employees carry out their tasks and responsibilities on the basis of the following ethical principles e.g   a To conduct business in an honest and ethical manner across its various offices around the world b. To base decisions on honesty, fairness, respect, responsibility, integrity, trust, and sound business judgment C That no illegal or unethical conduct on the part of officers, directors, employees, or affiliates is in the companys best interest and d. Not to compromise the company's principles for shortterm advantage MASTERCARD ILLUSTRATION ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES AND MEASURES Mastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry Its global payments processing network connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments and businesses in more than  countries and territories. To achieve its vision, Mastercard leveraged Al in many applications such as fraud prevention, forecasting future spending trends and improving user retail experience. To ensure robust oversight of Mastercard's use of Al, Mastercard established a Governance Council to review and approve the implementation of Al applications that are determined to be high risk The Governance Council is chaired by its Executive Vice President of the Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence, and whose members include the Chief Data Officer Chief Privacy Officer Chief Information Security Officer data scientists and representatives from business teams. Mastercard has defined clear roles and responsibilities for the Governance Council Each representative on the Council brings their expertise to the decision making process  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  a Chief Data Officer will review the proposal for implementation of and Chief Privacy Al to ensure that the Officer Data is fit for purpose for Al Al is used for an ethical purpose and Impact to an individual is appropriate and potential harms including risks to privacy and data protection are sufficiently mitigated b Chief Information will ensure that security by design is Security Officer implemented that build and implement Al are in continued Data Science teams dialogue with the Data Office and the Privacy Office , so that there is continued information sharing regarding the required governance and the lifecycle of a particular implementation of an Al application Mastercard has also implemented risk management and internal controls to address the risk involved in the Al deployment For example, Mastercard conducts initial risk scoring to determine the risk of the proposed Al activity, which includes an evaluation of multiple factors including alignment with corporate initiatives, the data types and sources utilised, and the impact on individuals from Al decisions. In addition, Mastercard will identify potential mitigants as part of the process to reduce the level of risk posed by the data being collected or potential biases in the activity If an Al project has been identified as high risk, it will be referred to the Governance Council for review Low risk projects will not be subjected to a review and can proceed to the model development stage.

This section is intended to help organisations determine the appropriate extent of human oversight in Alaugmented decisionmaking . Having clarity on the objective of using Al is a first step in determining the extent of human oversight Organisations can start by deciding on their commercial objectives of using Al ensuring consistency in decisionmaking, improving operational efficiency and reducing costs, or introducing new product features to increase consumer choice These commercial objectives can then be weighed against the risks of using Al in the organisation's decisionmaking This assessment should be guided by organisations' corporate values, which in turn, could reflect the societal norms or expectations of the territories in which the organisations operate. Before deploying Al solutions, organisations should decide on their commercial objectives of using Al, and then weigh them against the risks of using Al in the organisation's decisionmaking . It is also desirable for organisations operating in multiple countries to consider the differences in societal norms, values andor expectations, where possible. Forexample, gaming advertisements may be acceptable in one country but not in another Even within a country, risks may vary significantly depending on where Al is deployed For example, risks to individuals associated with recommendation engines that promote products in an online mall or automating the approval of online applications for travel insurance may be lower than the risks associated with algorithmic trading facilities offered to sophisticated investors. key e.g  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  . Some risks to individuals may only manifest at group level For example, widespread adoption of a stock recommendation algorithm might cause herding behaviour increasing overall market volatility if sufficiently large numbers of individuals make similar decisions atthe same time. In addition to risks to individuals, other types of risks may also be identified risk to an organisation's commercial reputation . Organisations' weighing of their commercial objectives against the risks of using Al should ideally be guided by their corporate values. Organisations can assess if the intended Al deployment and the selected model for algorithmic decisionmaking are consistent with their own core values inconsistencies and deviations should be conscious decisions made by organisations with a clearly defined and documented rationale. . As identifying commercial objectives, risks and determining the appropriate level of human involvement in Alaugmented decisionmaking is an iterative and ongoing process, it is desirable for organisations to continually identify and review risks relevant to their technology solutions, mitigate those risks, and maintain a response plan should mitigation fail. Documenting this process through a periodically reviewed risk impact assessment helps organisations develop clarity and confidence in using the Al solutions It will also help organisations respond to potential challenges from individuals, other organisations or businesses, and regulators e.g. Any   WHAT ARE THE THREE BROAD APPROACHES OF HUMAN INVOLVEMENT IN AIAUGMENTED DECISIONMAKING? . Based on the risk management approach described above, the Model Framework identifies three broad approaches to classify the various degrees of human oversight in the decisionmaking process a Humanintheloop suggests that human oversight is active and involved, with the human retaining full controlandthe Al only providing recommendations or input Decisions cannot be exercised without affirmative actions by the human, such as a human command to proceed with a given decision. For example, a doctor may use Al to identify possible diagnoses of and treatments for an unfamiliar medical condition. However the doctor will make the final decision on the diagnosis and the corresponding treatment This model requires Al to provide enough information for the human to make an informed decision e.g. factors that are used in the decision, their value and weighting, correlations b Humanoutoftheloop suggests that there is no human oversight over the execution of decisions The Al system has full control without the option of human override. For example, a product recommendation solution may automatically suggest products and services to individuals based on predetermined demographic and behavioural profiles Al can also dynamically create new profiles, then make product and service suggestions rather than relying on predetermined categories. machine learning model might also be used by an airline to forecast demand or likely disruptions, and the outputs of this model are used by a solver module to optimise the airline's scheduling, without a human in the C Humanovertheloop orhumanontheloop suggests that human oversight is involved to the extent that the human is in a monitoring or supervisory role, with the ability to take over control when the Al model encounters unexpected or undesirable events such as model failure. This approach allows humans to adjust parameters during the operation of the algorithm. For example, a GPS navigation system plans the route from Point A to Point B, offering several possible routes for the driver to pick The driver can alter parameters e.g due to unforeseen road congestions during the trip without having to reprogramme the route. loop.  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  . The Model Framework also proposes a design framework structured as a matrix to help organisations determine the level ofhuman involvement required in Alaugmented decisionmaking This design framework is structured two axes the a probability and b severity ofharm to an individual or organisation as a result of the decision made by an organisation about that individual or organisation . The definition of harm and the computation of probability and severity will depend on the context and vary from sector to sector For example, the considerations of a hospital regarding the harm associated with a wrong diagnosis of a patients medical condition will differ from the considerations of a clothing store's regarding the harm associated with a wrong product recommendation for apparels. Hieh severity High severity L Low probability High probability   Low severity Low severity Low probability High probability Probability of Harm . The matrix, however should not be taken to imply that the probability of harm and severity of harm are the only factors to be considered in determining the level ofhuman oversight in an organisation's decisionmaking process involving Al although are generally two of the more important factors c . For safetycritical systems, it would be prudent for organisations to ensure that a person be allowed to assume control, with the Al system providing sufficient information for that person to make meaningful decisions or to safely shut down the system where human control is not possible. Other factors that organisations in various contexts may consider relevant could also include a the nature of harm i.e whether the harm is physical or intangible in nature b the reversibility of harm, and as a corollary to this, the ability for individuals to obtain recourse and c whether it is operationally feasible or meaningful for a human to be involved in decisionmaking process having humanintheloop would be unfeasible in high financial trading, and be impractical in the case of driverless vehicles along they e.g. speed   USING THE PROBABILITYSEVERITY OF HARM MATRIX An online retail store wishes to use Al to fully automate the recommendation of food products to individuals based HIGHLY on their browsing behaviours and purchase histories. The RECOMMENDED! automation will meet the organisation's commercial objective of operational efficiency Probabilityseverity assessment The definition of harm can be the impact of making product recommendations that do not address the perceived needs of the individuals. The severity of harm in making the wrong product recommendations to individuals may be low since individuals ultimately decide whether to make the purchase The probability of harm may be high or low depending on the efficiency and efficacy of the Al solution.

Low probability High probability  Low severity Low severity  Low probability High probability lumameout ofetheloop Probability of Harm Regular review The organisation regularly reviews its approach i.e. humanoutoftheloop to reassess the severity and probability of harm, and as societal norms and values evolve. Note This is a simple illustration using brightline norms and values. Organisations can consider testing this method of determining the Al decisionmaking model against cases with more challenging and complex ethical dilemmas. points  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  SUADE LABS ILLUSTRATION ON DETERMINING THE LEVEL OF HUMAN INVOLVEMENT IN AIAUGMENTED DECISIONMAKING Suade Labs Suade  is a RegTech firm that operates globally and is a World Economic Forum Technology Pioneer Suade provides an Alenabled solution that allows financial institutions to process large volumes of granular data and generate the required regulatory data, calculations, and reports with the necessary controls and governance. Suade's solution also allows users to analyse the impact of the existing stock of regulation, including the impact of individual pieces of legislation. In determining the level of human involvement in decisionmaking using Al, Suade considered the following key factors a Degree of domain knowledge legal or policymaking knowledge required to accurately interpret the results of the algorithm. b Cost of noncompliance to regulation if the Al tool does not accurately analyse the impact of regulation and provide correct suggestions for regulatory compliance. As Suade's solution requires a certain degree of domain knowledge from human experts, and given that the cost of regulatory noncompliance as a result of incorrect recommendations made by the Al solution will be significant to users, Suade has thus adopted a humanintheloop approach for its Al solution On the other hand, when it comes to tuning the Al model, Suade adopts a humanovertheloop approach In general, Suade tunes the Al model to automatically favour the identification of false positives over false negatives. However Suade conducted user research, which informed them that some users the model to favour false negatives over false positives. Therefore, Suade adopts a humanovertheloop approach so that the Al model can be tuned to account for the differing preferences of its users with respect to whether the algorithm produces results that favours false positives or false negatives e.g prefer   GRAB ILLUSTRATION ON DETERMINING THE LEVEL OF HUMAN INVOLVEMENT IN AIAUGMENTED DECISIONMAKING Grab is a Singaporebased company that offers ridehailing transport services, food delivery and epayment solutions. It uses Al across its platform, from ride allocation, detecting safety incidents, to identifying fraudulent transactions. In particular Grab uses Al to improve the overall quality of trip allocations and minimise trip cancellations To allocate trips successfully, Grab's Al model considers drivers' preferences based on the following key factors a Drivers preferences for certain trip types b. Preferred locations where a driver start and end their and C Other selective driving behaviours. In determining the level of human involvement in its Al's decisionmaking for trip allocation, Grab considered the following factors a The scale of realtime decisionmaking required. As Grab has to make over , trip allocations every minute, this would mean an impact to customers in terms of 'efficiency and cost if a human had to review each trip allocation and b The severity and probability to users should the Al model work in a sub optimal manner Among other factors, Grab considered that  it is not technically feasible for a human to make high volume of trip allocations in a short amount oftime and  there is often little or no harm to life should there be less than optimal trip allocations. Hence , Grab decided to adopt a humanoutoftheloop approach for its Al model deployed for trip allocation, while continuously reviewing the Al model to ensure optimal performance day key such  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT . This section is intended to help organisations adopt responsible measures in the operations aspect of their Al adoption process reference Al adoption process is set out in order to provide a context for the recommendations for good governance in respect of the organisation's data, algorithm and Al model. . The Model Framework uses the following generalised Al model development and deployment process to describe phases in implementing an Al solution by an organisation. It should be noted that this process is not always unidirectional  it can, and usually is, a continuous process of learning Data Preparation Algorithms Chosen Model Stage  Stage  Stage  Raw data is formatted Models are trained on The chosen model is and cleansed so the dataset and used to produce conclusions can be algorithms may be probability scores that drawn accurately This includes can be incorporated Generally accuracy and statistical or machine into applications to insights increase with learning models offer predictions, make relevance and the including decision trees decisions, solve amount of data and neural networks The problems and trigger results are examined and actions. models are iterated until the most appropriate model emerges Machine Learning Algorithms Raw Data Data pre Prepared Apply Candidate Chosen processing Data Algorithms Model Model Raw andor Train Data Al Model Application Iterate until data is ready Iterate for most appropriate model Adapted from Machine learning at scale Microsoft Azure  December   accessed December . applied.   . During deployment algorithms such as linear regression algorithms, decision trees, or neural networks are for analysis on training datasets. The resulting algorithmic models are examined and algorithms are iterated until a model that produces the most appropriate results for the use case emerges This model and its results are then incorporated into applications to offer predictions, make decisions, solve problems and trigger actions. The intimate interaction between data and algorithm model is the focus of this part of the Model Framework DATA FOR MODEL DEVELOPMENT . Datasets used for building models may come from multiple sources, and could include both personal and nonpersonal data. The quality and selection of data from each of these sources are critical to the success of an Al solution If a model is built using biased, inaccurate or nonrepresentative data, the risks of unintended discriminatory decisions from the model will increase. To ensure the effectiveness of an Al solution, relevant departments within the organisation with responsibilities over quality of data, model training and model selection must work together to put in place data accountability practices. . The persons who are involved in training and selecting models for deployment may be internal staff or external service providers It is ideal for the models deployed in an intelligent to have an internal departmental owner who will be the one making decisions on which models to deploy To ensure the effectiveness of an Al solution, it would be helpful for relevant departments within the organisation with responsibilities over quality of data, model training and model selection to work together to put in place good data accountability practices. These include the following applied good system  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  a Understanding the lineage of data This means knowing where the data originally came from, how it was collected, curated and moved within the organisation, and how its accuracy is maintained over time. Data lineage can be represented visually to trace how the data moves from its source to its destination, how the data transformed along the way where itinteracts with other data, and how the representations change There are three types of data lineage Backward data lineage looks at the data from its enduse and backdating it to its source. ii. Forward data lineage begins at the data's source and follows it through to its enduse. iii. Endtoend data lineage combines the two and looks at the entire solution from both the data's source to its enduse and from its enduse to its source. Keeping a data provenance record allows an organisation to ascertain the quality of the data based on its origin and subsequent transformation, trace potential sources of errors, data, and attribute data to their sources In some instances, the origin of data could be difficult to establish. One example could be datasets obtained from a trusted thirdparty which may have commingled data from multiple sources It would be prudent for organisations to assess the risks of using such data and manage them accordingly gets update   b Ensuring data quality Organisations are encouraged to understand and address factors that may affect the quality of data, such as The accuracy of the dataset, in terms of how well the values in the dataset match the true characteristics of the entities described by the dataset ii. The completeness of the dataset, both in terms of attributes and items iii. The veracity of the dataset, which refers to how credible the data is, including whether the data originated from a reliable source iv. How recently the dataset was compiled or updated The relevance of the dataset and the context for data collection, as it may affect the interpretation of and reliance on the data for the intended purpose vi. The integrity of the dataset that has been joined from multiple datasets, which refers to how well extraction and transformation have been performed vii. The usability of the dataset including how well the dataset is structured in a machine understandable and viii. Human interventions ifany human has filtered, labels, or edited the data Minimising inherent bias There are many types of bias relevant to AI The Model Framework focuses on inherent bias in datasets, which may lead to undesired outcomes such as unintended discriminatory decisions. Organisations should be aware that the data which provide to Al systems could contain inherent biases and are encouraged to take steps to mitigate such bias. The two common types of bias in data include form e.g applied they  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  Selection bias This bias occurs when the data used to produce the model are not fully representative of the actual data or environment thatthe model may receive or function in. Common examples of selection bias in datasets are omission bias and stereotype bias. Omission bias describes the omission of certain characteristics from the dataset For example, a dataset consisting only of Asian faces will exhibit omission bias ifit is used for facial recognition training for a population that includes nonAsians A dataset of vehicle types within the central business district on a weekday may exhibit stereotype bias weighted in favour of cars, buses and motorcycles but underrepresent bicycles if it is used to model the types of transportation available in Singapore Ti. Measurement bias This bias occurs when the data collection device causes the data to be systematically skewed in a particular direction. For example, the training data could be obtained using camera with a colour filter that has been turned off, thereby skewing the machine learning result While identifying and addressing inherent bias in datasets may not be easy, organisations can mitigate the risk of inherent bias by having a heterogeneous dataset i.e. collecting data from a variety of reliable sources Another way is to ensure the dataset is as complete as possible, both from the perspective of data attributes and data items Premature removal of data attributes can make it difficult to identify and address inherent bias.   d. Different datasets for training testing and validation Different datasets are required for training, testing, and validation. The model is trained using the training data , while the model's accuracy is determined using the test data. Where applicable, the model could also be checked for systematic bias by testing it on different demographic groups to observe whether any groups are being systematically advantaged or disadvantaged Finally, the trained model can be validated using the validation dataset It is considered good practice to split a large dataset into subsets for these purposes, if it does not lead to a significant reduction in the quality of data in terms of accuracy and representation. However where this is not possible e.g if the organisation is not working with large datasets or are using pretrained models as in the case of transfer learning, organisations are encouraged to be cognisant of the risks of systematic bias and in place appropriate safeguards. Periodic reviewing and updating of datasets It would be prudent for datasets including training, testing, and validation datasets to be reviewed periodically to ensure accuracy, quality, currency, relevance and reliability Where necessary, the datasets can be updated with new input data obtained from actual use of the Al models deployed in production. When such new input data is used, organisations need to be aware of potential bias as using new input data that has already gone through a model once could create a reinforcement bias. . Even if only nonpersonal data are used for the training of Al models including personal data that has been anonymised , the data accountability practices above remain relevant put good  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  SUADE LABS ILLUSTRATION ON MANAGING DATA FOR MODEL DEVELOPMENT Suade introduced above has developed an Alenabled solution that financial institutions generate the required data and reports to comply with regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions where operate As the data used for Suade's Al model development directly affects its quality and performance, Suade has adopted several good data accountability practices For example, to ensure that regulatory data comes from a credible and reliable source Suade obtains and updates regulatory data only from the relevant regulators In addition, Suade tags the datasets used with additional metadata. This allows Suade to trace datasets back to their original source when needed, such as where inconsistencies are found. Further in order to trace which particular datasets were used in an Al model, Suade also documents and stores such information pertaining to model development on its database. Suade also minimises the inherent risks of Al models through responsible data tagging By using a larger number of taggers i.e. people who tag data, Suade aims to make the output of its Al models as neutral as possible, and reduce the risk of its taggers being influenced by the context ofthe data which often comprise of text are annotating In other words, Suade uses as many individuals as practicable to tag data to reduce the risk of tagger bias. In addition, Suade developed a tagging system to facilitate the annotation of data This system is used to generate training data used by the algorithm. Suade will further develop this tagging system to enhance its ability to manage multiple annotators and to better select datasets used for model training Suade also periodically updates the tagging system with new data. New training data is subsequently fed repeatedly back into the Al model. This way, the Al model is able to continuously learn from new sets of data. Another data accountability practice that Suade adopts is the use of validation schema checks at various stages of data transformation This is a process in which Suade verifies that the data schema accurately represents the data from the source, to ensure that there are no errors in factors such as the data's formatting and content helps they they   PYMETRICS ILLUSTRATION ON MANAGING BIASES IN DATASETS FOR MODEL DEVELOPMENT pymetrics is a technology provider that uses neuroscience insights and audited Al models to help evaluate applicants in a more predictive and less biased manner To develop an Al model, pymetrics Gets its clients' topperforming employees to go through pymetrics' assessments, and builds a trait of an employee that best fit the specific job role Validates the trait profile with the clients HR team and Collects behavioural data of applicants through pymetrics' gamified assessments, and assesses the suitability of the applicants based on the trait profile. To deal with socially sensitive features and mitigate the risk of inherent or unintentional bias in the datasets used by the Al model, pymetrics Uses objective data based on established neuroscience research attention to detail, attention span and ability to recall , which are generally stable across gender racial and age groups. Proactively debiases all Al models to ensure that are fully representative of the environment that may function in, so that the Al models do not disadvantage people on the basis of their demographic features The standards for fairness are informed by legal requirements As a pre hire assessment pymetrics models must pass a test known as the four fifths rule which is commonly cited in employment law. According to US' Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEOC , the selection rate for any legally protected group must be at least  of the selection rate for the majority group. For example, if an employer screens  qualified applicants  men and  women, a model that selects  men must also select at least  women pymetrics will test the Al model against a dataset of users from diverse demographics to ensure that random patterns in the data are not learned by the model and to address any potential for bias. profile e.g they they  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  pymetrics would conduct further debiasing on additional demographic based on geographical relevance or legal requirements pymetrics uses a bias ratio to compare the proportional pass rates of the highestpassing demographic group with the lowestpassing group for each demographic category e.g gender and ethnicity. The Al model would be deployed only if meet the EEOC standards. After Al deployment pymetrics Will test the Al model's decisions on real applicants for adverse impact and Revisits the longterm impact of its system's predictions on retention for the role. If bias is found either before or after deployment, pymetrics will adjust the Al modelto optimise for fairness towards while ensuring the predictive performance of the Al model ALGORITHM AND MODEL . Al systems may have numerous features or functionalities enabled through algorithms in Al models. Measures such as explainability, repeatability, robustness, regular reproducibility, traceability, and auditability can enhance the transparency of algorithms found in Al models. It may not be feasible or cost effective to implement even the most essential ofthese measures for all algorithms Organisations are encouraged to take a riskbased approach in making a twofold assessment First, identify the subset of features or functionalities that have the greatest impact on stakeholders for which such measures are relevant. Second, identify which of these measures will be most effective in building trust with their stakeholders Some of these measures like explainability or repeatability, when using models that are not easily explained , robustness and regular tuning are sufficiently essential that could, to varying extents, be incorporated as part of the organisation's Al deployment process. Other measures, such as reproducibility, traceability and auditability are more resourceintensive and may be relevant for features or in specific scenarios. they applicants tuning, they specific   Explainability . Explainability is achieved by explaining how deployed Al models' algorithms function andor how the decisionmaking process incorporates model predictions The purpose of being able to explain predictions made by Al is to build understanding and trust An algorithm deployed in an Al solution is said to be explainable if how it functions and how it arrives at a particular prediction can be explained When an algorithm cannot be explained, understanding and trust can still be built by explaining how predictions play a role in the decisionmaking process . Organisations deploying Al solutions are recommended to adopt the following practices a Model training and selection are necessary for developing an intelligent system i.e. a system that contains Al technologies. Documenting how the model training and selection processes are conducted, the reasons for which decisions are made, and measures taken to address identified risks will enable the organisation to provide an account of the decisions subsequently In this regard, the field of Automated Machine Learning aims to automate a significant portion of machine learning workflows, including feature engineering, feature selection, model selection and hyperparameter tuning Organisations using these types of tools can consider the transparency explainability and traceability of the automated machine learning approach, as well as the models selected. b Incorporating descriptions of the solutions' design and expected behaviour into product or service descriptions and system technical specifications documentation demonstrates accountability to individuals andlor regulators. This could also include design decisions in relation to why certain features, attributes or models are selected in place of others. These steps can help provide greater clarity on an Al model by giving understandable and digestible insights into how the model operates  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  Where an organisation's Al system was obtained or procured from a thirdparty Al solution provider the organisation can consider requesting assistance from the Al solution provider as may be better placed to explain how the solution functions. C Supplementary explanation tools are helpful for explaining Al models especially models that are less interpretable also known as black box systems These tools help make the underlying rationale of an Al system's output more interpretable and intelligible to those who use the system. It is possible to use a combination of these tools to improve the explainability of an Al model's decision . Technical explainability may not always be enlightening, especially to the man on the street Implicit explanations of how the Al models' algorithms function may be more useful than explicit descriptions of the models' logic For example, providing an individual with counterfactuals such as you would have been approved if your average debt was  lower andlor comparisons such as these are users with similar profiles to yours that received a similar decision can be a powerful type of explanation that organisations could consider . Nevertheless, there may be scenarios where it might not be practical or reasonable to provide information in relation to an algorithm. For example, disclosing algorithms deployed for anti money laundering detection, information security, and fraud prevention may allow bad actors to avoid detection likewise , providing detailed information about proprietary algorithms or the decisions made by the algorithms may expose confidential business information. These tools are known as supplementary' as there is at present no single comprehensive technical solution for making Al models explainable. These tools thus play a supplementary role in providing some level of interpretability on an Al model's operation. Examples of these tools include the use of surrogate models, partial dependence plots, global variable importancelinteraction, sensitivity analysis, counterfactual explanations, or SelfExplaining and AttentionBased Systems they   Repeatability . Where explainability cannot practicably be achieved given the state of technology, organisations can consider documenting the repeatability of results produced by the Al model. Repeatability refers to the ability to consistently perform an action or make a decision, given the same scenario. While repeatability of results is not equivalent to explainability of algorithm , some degree of assurance of consistency in performance could provide Al users with a larger degree of confidence. Helpful practices include a Conducting repeatability assessments for commercial deployments in live environments to ensure that deployments are repeatable b Performing counterfactual fairness testing Counterfactual fairness testing ensures that a model's decisions are the same in both the real world and in a counterfactual world where attributes deemed sensitive such as race or gender are altered C Assessing how exceptions can be identified and handled when decisions are not repeatable, e.g when randomness has been introduced by design d. Ensuring exception handling is in line with organisations' policies In this regard, it may be helpful to use Al models that are able to recognise when a given set of facts contains new variables not previously considered and are able to highlight these new variables to a human e Identifying and accounting for changes over time to ensure that models trained on timesensitive data remain relevant James Manyika , Jake Sitberg, and Brittany Presten, What Do We Do About the Biases in Al? Harvard Business Review  October   accessed  October .  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  Robustness . Robustness refers to the ability of a computer system to cope with errors during execution and erroneous input, and is assessed by the degree to which a system or component can function correctly in the presence of invalid input or stressful environmental conditions. Ensuring that deployed models are sufficiently robust will contribute towards building trust in the Al system. . The concept of robustness arises because it is not possible for models to be able to enumerate and set out all preconditions and consequences for an action. This creates the possibility of models producing insensible or unexpected results even with minor modifications to input data thatmay not even be perceptible to humans Testing for robustness can be achieved through scenariobased testing for foreseeable erroneous input  To ensure that models are more robust, organisations can consider working with Al developers to conduct adversarial testing on their models to ensure that their models are able to handle a broader range of unexpected input variables especially for publicfacing Al systems. As this is a resourceintensive exercise , organisations can take a riskbased approach towards identifying the subset of Alpowered features in their products or services that requires adversarial testing . No model can be perfectly robust as it is not possible to detect all possible modifications to a set of input data. For this reason, organisations intending to use continual learning i.e where the learned parameters of a machine learning model are not fixed but the model continues to change its learned parameters after being deployed into production are encouraged to be aware of the risks of doing so, should the continual learning model behave in an unpredictable manner This is distinct from user acceptance testing UAT , which is process where actual software users test piece of software to ensure that it can handle required tasks in real world scenarios, based on specifications UAT is often critical step that is taken before newlydeveloped software is released to the market   Regular tuning . Establishing an internal policy and process to perform regular model tuning is effective for ensuring that deployed models cater for changes to customer behaviour over time. This allows organisations to refresh models based on updated training datasets that incorporate new input data. Model tuning may also be necessary when commercial objectives, risks, or corporate values change. . Wherever possible, testing should reflect the dynamism of the planned production environment To ensure safety, testing may need to assess the degree to which an Al solution generalises well and fails gracefully For example, a warehouse robot tasked with avoiding obstacles to complete a task picking up packages could be tested with different types of obstacles and realistically varied internal environments workers wearing a variety of different coloured shirts. Otherwise, models risk learning regularities in the environment that do not reflect actual production environment conditions assuming that all humans that it must avoid will be wearing white lab coats. Once Al models are deployed in the realworld environment active monitoring, review and tuning are advised. Traceability . An Al model is considered to be traceable if a its decisions, and b the datasets and processes that the Al model's decision including those of data gathering, data labelling and the algorithms used , are documented in an easily understandable way The former refers to traceability of Alaugmented decisions, while the latter refers to traceability in model training Traceability facilitates transparency and explainability, and is also helpful for other reasons. First, the information might also be useful for troubleshooting, or for an investigation into how the model was functioning or why a particular prediction was made. Second, the traceability record in the form ofan audit log can be a source of input data that can be used as a training dataset in the future. e.g e.g. e.g yield  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  . Practices that organisations may consider to promote traceability include a Building an audit trail to document the model training and Alaugmented decision. b. Implementing a black box recorder that captures all input data streams. For example, a black box recorder in a driving car tracks the vehicle's position and records when and where the selfdriving system takes control of the vehicle, suffers a technical problem or requests the driver to take over the control of the vehicle. C Ensuring that data relevant to traceability are stored appropriately to avoid degradation or alteration, and retained for durations relevant to the industry . As traceability measures may lead to an accumulation of a large volume of activity data, organisations can consider which oftheir product features require traceability and which traceability measures might be sufficient for their needs, bearing in mind the resources needed to document the Al model's decisions, datasets and processes. Organisations could assess this based on several factors, including a Their assessment of the probability andlor severity of harm arising from the use of the Al system bs The extent to which the Al model had previously been trialled or used and C The regulatory needs of their industry It should be noted that black box recorder does not refer to black box in the Al model sense i.e. where the decisionmaking process of an Al model is inherently difficult to interpret and explain. self   Reproducibility . While repeatability refers to the internal repetition of results within ones organisation, reproducibility refers to the ability of an independent verification team to produce the same results using the same Al method based on the documentation made by the organisation. Reproducibility can influence the trustworthiness of the Al product and the organisation deploying the Al model. As implementing reproducibility entails the involvement of external parties, organisations can take a riskbased approach towards identifying the subset of Alpowered features in their products or services that requires external reproducibility testing . The following practices contribute towards reproducibility a Testing whether specific contexts or particular conditions would need to be taken into account to ensure reproducibility b. Putting in place verification methods to ensure different aspects of the Al models reliability and reproducibility C Making available replication files .e. files that replicate each step of the Al models developmental process to facilitate the process of testing and reproducing behaviours d. For companies that procure commercial offtheshelf Al systems, checking with the original Al solution provider about whether the model's results are reproducible and Adopting in paragraph . ce under repeatability namely, assessing how exceptions can be identified and handled, ensuring that exception handling is in line with organisational policies, and identifying and accounting for changes over time. points  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  Auditability . Auditability refers to the readiness of an Al system to undergo an assessment of its algorithms, data and design processes. The evaluation of the Al system by internal or external auditors and the availability of evaluation reports can contribute to the trustworthiness of the Al system as it demonstrates the responsibility of design and practices and the justifiability of outcomes It should, however be noted that auditability does not necessarily entail making information about business models or intellectual property related to the Al system publicly available . Implementing auditability not only entails the involvement of external parties but requires disclosure of commercially sensitive information to the auditors, who may be external. Organisations can take a riskbased approach towards identifying the subset of Alpowered features in their products or services for which implementing auditability is necessary, or where implementing auditability is necessary for an organisation to align itself with regulatory requirements or industry practice. . To facilitate auditability, organisations can consider keeping a comprehensive record of data provenance, procurement, pre processing, lineage, storage and security The record could also include qualitative input about data representations, data sufficiency, source integrity, data timelines, data relevance, and unforeseen data issues encountered across the workflow . Organisations may also wish to centralise such information digitally in a process This would enable the organisation to make available, in one place, information that may assistin demonstrating to concerned parties and affected decision subjects both the responsibility of design and practices and the justifiability of the outcomes of your system's processing behaviour Such a would also enable better organisation of the accessibility and presentation of information yielded, assist in the curation and protection of data that should be kept unavailable from view, and increase the organisation's capacity to cater the presentation of results to different tiers of stakeholders with different interests and levels of expertise. log log public   SYMPHONY AYASDIAI ILLUSTRATION ON DOCUMENTING MODEL DEVELOPMENT Symphony AyasdiAI Ayasdi offers a solution that helps its clients, mainly in the US banking and finance sector to build Al models that can adequately forecast revenues and the capital reserve required to absorb losses under stressed economic conditions.

The entire model creation process is documented automatically The clients can use AMA to institutionalise both their variable selection and modelling methodology, systematically and deterministically to produce a repeatable process with consistent supporting reports on model lineage, variable selection and crossvalidation. This allows the clients to ensure that initial selections of features and models are recorded and documented At the same time, the entire modelling and approval process is tracked and catalogued, thus facilitating subsequent processes from review to model reuse The ability to demonstrate the detailed process of model building and the rigour of evaluating challenger models allows Ayasdi's clients to explain to the US Federal Reserve how their final models are selected explains  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  STAKEHOLDER INTERACTION AND COMMUNICATION  . This section is intended to help organisations take appropriate steps to build trust in the stakeholder relationship strategies when deploying AI. General disclosure . Organisations are encouraged to provide general information on whether Al is used in their products andor services. Where appropriate, this could include information on what Al is, how Al is used in decisionmaking in relation to consumers, what are its benefits, why your organisation has decided to use Al, how your organisation has taken steps to mitigate risks, and the role and extent that Al plays in the decisionmaking process. For example, an online portal may inform its users that are interacting with an Alpowered chatbot and not a human customer service agent . Organisations can consider disclosing the manner in which an Al decision may affect an individual consumer and whether the decision is reversible. For example, an organisation may inform the individuals that their credit ratings may lead to a loan refusal not only from this organisation but also from other similar organisations, while also informing them that such a decision is reversible if individuals can provide more evidence on their credit worthiness. Policy for explanation . Organisations are encouraged to develop a policy on what explanations to provide to individuals and when to provide them. Such policies help ensure consistency in communication, and clearly sets out roles and responsibilities of different members of your organisation. These can include explanations on how AI works in an Alaugmented decisionmaking process, how a specific decision was made and the reasons behind that decision, and the impact and consequence of the decision. The explanation can be provided as part of general communication It can also be information in respect of a decision upon request In this regard, the principle of equivalence can provide some guidance such that the same standards of disclosure forhuman driven decisions is applied to decisions that have been made or augmented by an Al system. they specific   Bringing explainability and transparency together in a meaningful way . Appropriate interaction and communication inspire trust and confidence as build and maintain open relationships between organisations and individuals including employees . Stakeholder relationship strategies should also not remain static. Companies are encouraged to test, evaluate and review their strategies for effectiveness Further the extent and mode of implementation of these factors could vary from scenario to scenario. . As different stakeholders have different information needs, an organisation can start by first identifying its audience i.e its external and internal stakeholders. An organisation's external stakeholders may include consumers, regulators, other organisations it does business with, and society at large. Its internal stakeholders may include the organisation's board, management and employees. An organisation can also consider the purpose and the context of the interaction with its stakeholders. For the purposes of illustration, this Model Framework provides considerations for interacting with consumers and other organisations As different stakeholders have different information needs, an organisation can start by first identifying its audience and considering the purpose and the context of the interaction. Interacting with consumers . Organisations are encouraged to consider the information needs of consumers as go through the journey of interacting with Al , from considering whether to use an Al solution, to understanding how the Al solution works as they use it, to requesting for reviews on the decisions made by the Al solution A typical consumer journey may entail meeting the following information needs of consumers they they  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  a Making sure that consumers are aware that the products or services that are considering are Alenabled. Such information could be provided as part of a general product description. b Providing information so that consumers know how the Alenabled features are expected to behave during normal use The information could be provided in more detailed descriptions or specifications of product features. This, however may not be necessary for every feature that is Alenabled Organisations are encouraged to identify those features where providing additional information in this manner will enhance consumer trust. Similarly, if Al is used in decisionmaking, information may be provided so that consumers understand how decisions made with the assistance of Al may affect them. This can likewise be provided through descriptions of how the service will be provided For Alenabled features that consumers interact with regularly, providing information so that understand why the Alenabled feature is behaving in a certain way, and providing preference settings to allow consumers some influence over future behaviour where possible. As doing SO requires more engineering effort such as in the providing additional user interfaces to user history, and the level of information provided may be somewhat more detailed and personalised than feature descriptions, organisations will have to decide which of their product features will benefit from provision of this level of detail d. For Alaugmented decisions that affect consumers, consider providing additional information so that understand why the decisions were made and for certain categories of such decisions, providing an appropriate channel to contest such decisions The level of information that is provided will necessarily be detailed but this may not be necessary except for those scenarios where a customer is affected by the decision they they they   feATURB FeaTurE Ffature B General information on the AI More specific information is More indepth information is used is provided to potential provided to users  can provided to users if they users for them to decide understand how the app works challenge a decision or wish to whether to use it use provide feedback Option to optout . Organisations may wish to consider carefully when deciding whether to provide individuals with the option to opt out from the use of the Al product or service, and whether this option should be offered by default or only upon request Relevant considerations include a Degree of riskharm to the individuals b Reversibility of the decision made C Availability of alternative decisionmaking mechanisms d. Cost or tradeoffs of alternative mechanisms e Complexity and inefficiency of maintaining parallel systems and t, Technical feasibility . Where an organisation has weighed the factors above and decided notto providean option to optout, itisprudentforthe organisation to consider providing modes of recourse to the consumer such as providing a channel for reviewing the decision Where appropriate, organisations may also wish to a history of chatbot conversations when facing complaints or seeking recourse from consumers Communication channels . Organisations are encouraged to in place the following communications channels for their customers they during keep put  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  a Feedback channels This channel could be used for customers to raise feedback or raise queries It could be managed by an organisation's Data Protection Officer DPO if this is appropriate. Where customers find inaccuracies in their personal data which has been used for decisions affecting them, this channel can also allow them to correct their data Such correction and feedback, in turn, maintain data veracity It could also be managed by an organisation's Quality Service Manager QSM if stakeholders wish to raise feedback and queries on material inferences made about them b Decision review Apart from existing review channels obligations, organisations can consider providing an avenue for individuals such as an aggrieved consumer to request a review of material Al decisions that have affected them Where the effect of a fullyautonomous decision on a consumer may be material, it would be reasonable to provide an opportunity for the decision to be reviewed by a human Testing the user interface . Organisations are encouraged to test user interfaces and address usability problems before deployment, so that the user interface serves its intended purposes If applicable, organisations are also encouraged to inform individuals that their responses would be used to train the Al system a chatbot Organisations should be aware of the risks of using such responses as some individuals may intentionally use bad language or random replies' which would affect the training of the Al system Easytounderstand communications . Organisations are encouraged to communicate in an easyto understand manner to increase transparency There are existing tools to measure readability, such as the readability graph , the Gunning Index, the FleschKincaid readability tests, etc It would be helpful for decisions with higher impact to be communicated in an easytounderstand manner with the need to be transparent about the technology being used Besides textual communications, organisations can also consider visualisation tools, graphical representations, summary tables, or a combination of these. The priority is to convey your information, such as an explanation or interpretation, in a way that is understandable by an organisation's consumers and other stakeholders. e.g. Fry Fog using   Acceptable user policies . In certain cases, organisations may be implementing Alpowered solutions that are also trained on reallife input data i.e. active learning. These organisations may wish to consider setting out certain acceptable user policies AUPs to ensure that users do not maliciously introduce input data that unacceptably manipulates the performance andlor results of the solution's model This is pertinent, given examples of Al chatbot systems that have been unduly manipulated to issue publicly unacceptable responses. . In this regard, AUPs serve to set broad boundaries for the interactions that individuals can perform with the Al system, such as restrictions with regard to intentional actions or attempts to reverse engineer disable, interfere or disrupt the functionality, integrity or performance of the Alpowered service. Interacting with other organisations . Some of the approaches and methodologies described in the preceding section are also relevant when organisations interact with Al solution providers such as procuring Al solutions and obtaining regulatory approval , or other organisations such as facilitating industry collaboration, enabling interoperability of systems. Organisations would thus need to obtain sufficient information from Al solution providers to help them meet their business objectives for example, this could be a backtoback arrangement for providing the information described in paragraph .. This could be as straightforward as obtaining the Al solution providers' support to provide the information and to build the features necessary such that the deploying organisation can align itself to the Model Framework For example, information related to lineage of the training dataset and documenting the steps in the model training and selection process For example, the userfacing interactions providing information about the expected behavior of an Alpowered feature and building the function to allow users to manage preference settings that influence how the Alpowered feature will perform for them in future past key  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  . Organisations may have to consider the level of support and detailed information that may need to obtain from Al solution providers pertaining to a Data e.g types and range of data used in training the algorithm, source and quality of external training data b Model training and selection e.g. features and variables used and weights of the commercial models supplied, documenting the decisions made with respect to the model training and selection C Human elements nature of human involvement in developing the algorithm, or in the decisionmaking process d. Inferences e.g predictions made by the algorithm and how these are incorporated into product features or decision making e Algorithmic presence e.g where in the solution that an algorithm is used and f Measures and safeguards in place to mitigate biases in data and algorithms . Depending on the purpose and context, the type and level of detail of information required may be different For example, a regulator may require a regulated entity to demonstrate that its model development and selection process is sufficiently rigorous, and the Al solution provider may be required to provide more information and be involved in the clarification process with the regulator An industry collaborator on the hand, may be more concerned with factors pertaining to compatibility and interoperability Ethical evaluation . Finally, as ethical standards governing the development and use of Al evolve, organisations are encouraged to evaluate whether their Al governance practices and processes are in with evolving Al standards, and make available the outcome of such evaluations to relevant stakeholders they key e.g line   FACEBOOK ILLUSTRATION FOR STAKEHOLDER INTERACTION AND COMMUNICATION As a social media and technology company, Facebook is committed to being transparent with the and users on its operations and services, which includes the use of Al In particular Facebook strives to be meaningfully transparent with its users by a Providing a general disclosure about Facebook's collection and use of data in an easytounderstand manner This is achieved through its Terms of Service and Data Policy, accompanied by explanatory and user friendly videos b. Giving users easytouse and meaningful control over how their information will be used and shared C Publishing a policy for explanation through a series of blogposts to discuss complex subjects, explain the rationale of Facebooks decisions and invite experts to share their opinions. For example, Facebook published a Hard Questions blogpost on Face Recognition, which discussed how Facebook used face recognition to help users to tag photos and the controls implemented d. Promoting a series of Al educational initiatives and campaigns to help users learn about the technology that underlies the various products and features For example, Facebook's Artificial Intelligence Research Lab developed and published a series of Al Education videos to explain Machine Learning algorithms and how it is being used Facebook currently provides users with a customised News Feed that shows posts that are most relevant to them The content ofthe News Feed is determined by the people and pages a user chooses to friend and follow As part of Facebook's consultation on its News Feed feature, Facebook took into consideration a The need to be transparent and provide more information about the algorithms behind the feature public  MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  b. The type of information that would be most valuable to users. For example, Facebook included examples of people's interactions that contributed to posts on News Feed and C The need for users to take control or manage its News Feed With this, Facebook put in place the following to build trust with users a, Implement a Why am seeing this post? feature to explain how users' past interactions impacted the ranking of posts in the News Feed Specifically, users were able to learn The reason for viewing a certain post in the News Feed. For example, the post could be from a friend or Group or Page that the user has followed ii. Information that had the largest influence over the order of posts, including a the frequency in which the user interacts with posts from people, Pages or Groups b the frequency in which the user interacts with a type of post videos, photos or links and c the popularity of the posts shared by the people, Pages and Groups that the user follows iii. Shortcuts to controls that help users personalise its News Feed such as See First, Unfollow, News Feed Preferences and Privacy Shortcuts. b. Publish a series of News Feed FYI' posts that highlighted and explained the rationale for to News Feed. C Launch a new Inside Feed website that provided greater detail on how Facebook's systems worked and the way Facebook evaluated the changes.

Prior to deployment MSD's User Experience UX team tested the humanAI interface and addressed usability problems to ensure optimal user interaction with Jennie. In particular three tenets guided the development and deployment of Jennie a. Understanding a user's mental model The UX team conducted user research with representative users to understand users' expectations when interacting with a chatbot. The research covered the scope of IT questions, expected answers and the kinds of answers provided e.g how technical the answers should be phrased. By building a userfriendly interface, users would be more comfortable to interact and use the chatbot b. Taking a humancentric approach To understand patterns of human behaviour the team analysed how its employees reacted when faced with challenges in interacting with the chatbot Examples include how users formulate questions, whattypesofanswers satisfy usersandhow many times a chatbot should be allowed to attempt an answer After understanding the human interaction touchpoints, the team used these insights to create an information flow architecture to deliver a better experience for users C Managing the bothuman handover There could be instances where Jennie mightnotbe able to provide a satisfactory answer In such instances, the UX team determined that the chatbot would have a maximum of three attempts to provide a satisfactory reply, before forwarding the users request and chat logs to a customer care executive for followup. When employees engage Jennie, MSD will disclose on the landing page that Jennie is Alpowered and is a beta version which will improve over time see figure below.

Before embarking on an algorithm audit, it is advisable to consider whether the information that has already been made available to individuals, other organisations or businesses, and regulators is sufficient credible e.g product or service descriptions, system technical specifications, model training and selection records, data provenance record, audit trail b Target audience of audit results. This refers to the expertise required of the target audience to effectively understand the data, algorithm andor models. The information required by different audience vary When the audience consists of individuals, providing information on the decisionmaking process andor how the individuals' data is used in such processes will achieve the objective of explainable Al more efficaciously When the audience consists of regulators, information relating to data accountability and the functioning of algorithms should be examined first An algorithm audit can prove how an Al model operates if there is reason to doubt the veracity or completeness of information about its operation C General data accountability Organisations can provide information on how general data accountability is achieved within the organisations This includes all the good data practices described in the Model Framework under Data for Model Development section such as maintaining data lineage through keeping a data provenance record, ensuring data accuracy, minimising inherent bias in data, splitting data for different purposes, determining data veracity and reviewing and updating data regularly d. Algorithms in Al models can be commercially valuable information that can affect market competitiveness. For example, the algorithm may be a trade secret or may embody business rules that are trade secrets If a technical audit is contemplated, corresponding mitigation measures should also be considered nondisclosure agreements. and e.g   ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The PDPC expresses its sincere appreciation to the following individuals and organisations for their valuable feedback to the Model Framework in alphabetical order ASTAR IBM Asia Pacific Accenture LawTechAsia AIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte.

AIReady Society   Social Principles of HumanCentric AI . Social Principles of AI  . RandD and Utilization Principles of AI  Conclusion  Appendix About the Establishment of the Council for Social Principles of Humancentric AI   Introduction Our modern society faces many challenges that endanger the survival of humankind such as global environmental problems, growing economic disparity, and the depletion of resources. Japan is the first country to tackle social issues confronting a mature society, such as the declining birthrate and aging population, labor shortage, rural depopulation, and increased fiscal spending Artificial Intelligence Al is considered a technology to rescue society from these problems, to address the set forth in the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals SDGs, and to build a sustainable world. with the establishment of Society5.' whose purpose is to address social issues and economic development AI, aims to revitalize its society and economy, to be an internationally attractive society, and to contribute to the SDGs on a global scale. Similar to many other types of science and technology, AL will many benefits to society, but its large impact on society calls for appropriate development and implementation. In order to avoid or reduce the negative aspects in advance while making effective use of Alto benefit society, we should promote, together with the continued research and development RandD of technologies related to AI, a transformation into an AIReady Society where AI can be used effectively and safely We need to redesign society in every way including Japan's human potential, social systems, industrial structures, innovation systems, and governance. Depending on the researcher there are various ways of thinking about the definition of AI Artificial Intelligence, a central theme of this document and there is no clear definition at present For example, the EC HighLevel Expert Group defines AI as a system that performs intelligent operations which may have some autonomy in response to environment and input. However, the expression intelligent operation itself is somewhat vague and open for interpretation Also, the AILOO Report' published in the United States in  cites Nils J. Nilsson's definition4 of Al as a field of research according to which Artificial intelligence is that activity devoted to making machines intelligent, and intelligence is that quality that enables an entity to function appropriately and with foresight in its environment but this definition is also highly ambiguous. In actuality, the vague definition of Al within the same report in and of itself has a positive side that is accelerating the study of AI. In light of these circumstances, although there is a certain consensus 0n what to judge as AI or AI technology, it does not appear appropriate at this time to define it more strictly. In addition, various technologies normally called Al are seldom used alone but instead are generally incorporated and used as of an information system.

RandD and Utilization Principles of AI Figure l Overall Structure of This Document  An AIReady Society means that society as a whole has undergone the necessary changes to maximize the benefits of AI, enjoys the benefits of AI, or has introduced AI immediately when needed and is in state of being able to receive the benefits. It means a society adapted to the use of Al. For this purpose, society as whole needs to be transformed, including individuals, business organizations, and the social innovation environment Individually, for example, everyone should acquire appropriate Al literacy that allows them to use AI for work and life. In business organizations, meanwhile, corporate activities should be developed with strategies premised on the use of AI. In the social innovation environment, all information should be digitized in a form that allows for AI analysis, should be transformed into data, and should be maintained in a state in which it can be used for AI development and service provision    Basic Philosophy AI is expected to contribute significantly to the realization of Society .. We consider AI important not oly to return the benefits obtained from the efficiency and convenience of using AI to people and society, but also to use Al for the public ofhumanity as a whole, and to ensure global sustainability outlined in the SDGs through qualitative changes in social conditions and true innovation. We believe we should respect the following three values as our philosophy and build a society that pursues their realization.  Dignity A society that has respect for human dignity We should not build a society where humans are overly dependent on AI or where AI is used to control human behavior through the excessive pursuit of efficiency and convenience. We need to construct a society where human dignity is respected and, by using AI as a tool, a society where people can better demonstrate their various human abilities, show greater creativity, engage in challenging work, and live richer lives both physically and mentally.  Diversity and Inclusion A society where people with diverse backgrounds can pursue their own wellbeing It is both an ideal in the modern world and major challenge to create a society in which people with diverse backgrounds, values and ways of thinking can pursue their own wellbeing while society creates new value by flexibly embracing them. Alis a technology powerful enough to uS closer to this ideal. We need to change the nature of society in this way through the appropriate development and deployment of AI  Sustainability A sustainable society We need to use Al to create a succession of new businesses and solutions, resolve social disparities, and develop a sustainable society that can deal with issues such as global environmental problems and climate change. Japan, as a leading science and technology oriented country, has an obligation to strengthen its accumulated scientific and technological resources by utilizing Al and thereby contributing to the creation of such a sustainable society. good bring   Social Changes Needed to RealizeSociety . ALReady Society Technologies expected to contribute to the realization of Society . include AI IoT, Robotics, and ultrahighspeed broadband communication networks. Even if it becomes possible to some extent to entrust complex processes to machines using AI, it is still necessary for humans to set objectives that answer the question What are we AI for? While AI can be used to better society, it might also be used for undesirable purposes Or in inappropriate ways unconsciously. For this reason we are advancing technological developments in terms of Human Potential, Social Systems, Industrial Structures, Innovation Systems and Governance which can answer the question What are we using AI for? while paying close attention to their interaction with the progress of technology These five aspects are equally important in achieving Society .. Human Potential In an AIReady Society that is responsive to the spread of Al to every corner of society, how human respond to AI is the to realizing society where AL can be utilized. To that end, the expected abilities and roles of people are as follows A People should fully understand the advantages and disadvantages of AI. In particular people should have the ability to recognize that biases are included in the algorithms andlor data that will become the information resources of AI, and for example, that these biases may be used for undesirable purposes. In addition, people should recognize that there are three types of data bias statistical bias, bias caused by social conditions, and bias arising from malicious intent among AI users. B It is preferred that the use of AL will create an environment in which many people can engage in highly creative and productive work. To that end, it is expected that a diverse range of people will acquire the ability to realize their own dreams and ideas with Als support despite many differences in origin, culture, taste, and so on. An education system that achieves these as well as social systems that contribute to their achievement must be realized. It is important to have sufficient human resources with acquired application skills such as implementation and design of AI systems and basic knowledge of data and AI These skills would be acquired in crossdisciplinary range of fields in combined and integrated framework It is expected that such human resources will be the driving force of all activities in society, and that the capabilities of those people will contribute to the formation of an Albased environment. Given the establishment of such a environment we must implement social systems that allow many people to live a richer and more fulfilling life.  Social Systems The use of AI will most likely accelerate the evolution of individual service solutions and create various benefits from improved efficiency and individualization. In order to embrace the full benefits of this change in society, it is necessary for entire social systems including health care, finance, insurance, transportation, energy, and others to flexibly change and respond to the evolution of AI This includes simple efficiency in light of existing socially accepted objectives such as improved convenience and liberation from simple labor tasks It also includes the realization of new value potentially created by diversification and fluidization of objectives and resolving negative outcomes such as inequality, widening disparity, social exclusion, and so on that may result from the evolution of AI. To this end we need to implement flexible architecture designs equipped with mechanisms for expandability, interoperability, developing improved social order and s0 on, both in the software and the hardware aspects of each social Additionally, we need to establish common data  using beings key  fully goals living living system  utilization infrastructure for various social systems, in particular to ensure interoperability and connectivity  Industrial Structures In order for a diverse group of people to realize their assorted dreams and ideas, it is necessary for labor as well as employment and entrepreneur environments to be flexible and internationally open For this reason, companies should compete fairly and promote flexible working styles, human creativity should continually be demonstrated throughout industries, and investment in startup businesses should be promoted Innovation Systems environments that support innovation It is necessary for universities, research institutions, industries, and the public at large to participate in AIs RandD, utilization and evaluation across fields and positions, stimulating each other and creating an environment in which innovation can flourish To that end, all types of data including real space data should be instantaneously and securely available at a level that Al can analyze. Additionally, it is advisable to ensure privacy and security so that everyone can provide and distribute data with ease, and for there to be an environment where they can benefit from the data that they have provided It is advisable to accelerate the desired development of AI by establishing an environment in which those involved in RandD including users, can safely conduct RandD and utilization of AI, and the of RandD and utilization can move rapidly. Preferably, the utilization of Al will create new ideas and possibilities, and significantly expand the potential of innovation. Governance It is always necessary to continue to update the content and defined purposes discussed in the abovementioned sections Human Potential, Social Systems, Industrial Structures, and Innovation Systems in line with social changes and technological developments. For that reason, it is necessary to have a system that can be implemented and in place for various stakeholders, including government industry, universities, research institutions, and the general public. Then will be able to work together on such matters as identifying issues, evaluating impacts, and making decisions  regulatory governance including rules, systems, standardization and codes of conduct Additionally, it is necessary to listen to people, including those who have a difficult time having their opinions heard, in addition the various stakeholders, and to establish system that continuously addresses the most advanced social and technical issues. When implementing such governance, flexible and effective measures should be taken not only in terms of the law but also by means of industries with appropriate technical means taking the initiative. In addition, international coordination for governance is important, and in addition to governance in each individual country, an international system of cooperation for dealing with crossborder problems should be established. cycle they  Social Principlesof HumanCentric AI We recognize that in order to realize an AIReady Society and to promote an appropriate and proactive social implementation of AI, it is important to establish basic principles that each stakeholder should keep in mind. In order for AI to be accepted and properly used by society, we will systemize these basic principles into Social Principles of Al to which society especially state legislative and administrative bodies should pay attention, and RandD and Utilization Principles of Al to which developers and operators engaged in AI RandD and social implementation should pay attention The Social Principles of Al necessary for realizing a society with the three basic principles listed in Section , and the RandD and Utilization Principles of AI that developers and business operators should consider, are as follows  Social Principles of AI Social Principles of AI are principles relating to social frameworks that should be implemented across Japanese society including national and local governments as well as in multilateral frameworks in an AIReady Society.'  The HumanCentric Principle The utilization of Al must not infringe upon the fundamental human rights guaranteed by the Constitution and international standards. AI should be developed, utilized, and implemented in society to expand the abilities of people and allow diverse people to pursue their own wellbeing In a society making use of AI, it is desirable that we introduce appropriate mechanisms for literacy education and for the promotion of proper use of AI s0 that people do not become overdependent on AI or misuse AI to manipulate other people's decisionmaking AI can expand human abilities and creativity not only by replacing aspects ofhuman labor but also by assisting humans as a technologically advanced tool. When using AI, people must judge and decide for themselves how to use it. The appropriate stakeholders involved in the development, delivery and utilization of AI should be responsible for the consequences of AI utilization, depending on the nature of the problem In the process of AI deployment, each stakeholder should take into consideration the userfriendliness of the system in order to allow all people to enjoy the benefits of AI and avoid creating a digital divide with socalled information or technology poor people left behind The Principle of EducationLiteracy In a society premised on AI, we do not desire to create disparities Or divisions between people O create those who are socially disadvantaged. Therefore, policy makers and managers of businesses involved in AI must have an accurate understanding of AI, knowledge and ethics permitting appropriate use of AL in society They should take into account the complexity of Al and appreciate the possibility that AI could be intentional poor  misused. AI users should have a general understanding of AI and should acquire sufficient education to use it properly, given that AI platforms are much more complicated than already developed conventional tools. Regarding developers of AI, meanwhile, it is of course necessary for them to master the basics of Al technology Additionally, from the viewpoint of developing AI that is useful to society, it is important for developers to learn business models for how Al can be used in society, as well as to master a wide range of liberal arts such as social sciences and ethics including normative consciousness. From this point of view, we believe that an educational environment that fosters education and literacy in accordance with the following principles must be provided equally to all people. In order to prevent generating disparities between people or to create socially vulnerable individuals, opportunities for education in a wide range of literacy skills are to be provided in early childhood education and primary and secondary education. Opportunities are also to be provided for the reeducation of working adults and the elderly With regard to literacy education and skills required to use AI, ur society needs an educational system that allows anyone to acquire the basics of mathematics, and data science. All people need to learn beyond the boundaries of literature and science. It is also necessary to prepare content in literacy education on the limits of security and AI technology in order to raise awareness of AI and data characteristics. These characteristics include bias in data, the possibility of causing bias depending on how AI is used, and issues of fairness, impartiality, and privacy protection that are inherently needed in the use of AI In a society where AI is pervasive, it is to be expected that the educational environment will change from the current unilateral and uniform teaching style to one that makes use of individual interests and skill sets. For that reason, society as whole shares a sense that the education system is always changing flexibly to the optimal form of teaching regardless of previous successful experiences in the educational environment to date. In education it is desirable to have an interactive educational environment for the prevention of dropouts and an environment that fully utilizes AI technologies to allow students to work together It is desirable not to impose an unnecessary burden only on the administration or schools teachers, but to work independently with private enterprises and citizens toward the development of such an educational environment The Principle of Privacy Protection Not all AI technologies increase the risk associated with the use of personal data, but in a society premised on A, it is still possible to gauge each person's political position, economic situation, personal hobbies, personal preferences, and so forth with great accuracy based on data about matters such as data subject's individual behavior. This means, when utilizing AI, that more careful discretion may be required than the mere handling of personal data in accordance with the level of importance and sensitivity of the data. Each stakeholder must handle personal data based on the following principles to ensure that no individuals are disadvantaged from the unexpected distribution Or use  AI,  of personal data in undesirable ways. We should make sure that any AI using personal data and any service solutions that use AL, including use by the government, do not infringe on a person's individual freedom, dignity or equality. Ifthe use of AI threatens to increase the possibility ofharming individuals, technical mechanisms and nontechnical frameworks should be developed to reduce the risk In particular AL using personal data should have mechanisms to ensure accuracy and legitimacy, and to allow individuals to be substantially involved in managing the privacy of their personal data. This would make it possible for people to provide personal data with peace of mind when AI, and effectively benefit from the data they provide. Personal data must be protected appropriately according to its degree of importance and sensitivity Personal data contains a variety f information, ranging from matters that are highly likely to have a influence on an individual's rights and interests these would typically be personal thoughts, beliefs, medical history, criminal records, and s0 on, to matters that are semipublic in nature in a person's social life. Keeping this in mind, we need to pay close attention to the balance between the use of, and need for protection 0f, personal data based on the cultural background and common understanding of society. The Principle of Ensuring Security The active use of Al automates social systems and greatly improves safety. On the other hand, at least within the scope of currently available technologies, it is not always possible for AI to respond appropriately to rare events or deliberate attacks Therefore, the use of AI poses a new set of risks to security. Society should always be aware of the balance between the benefits and risks, and endeavor to improve social safety and sustainability as whole. Society must promote broad, deep research and development related to AI from immediate measures to deep essential understanding , such as the proper assessment of risks in the utilization of A and research to reduce risks. Society must make firm efforts to conduct risk management including the safeguard of cybersecurity. Society should always pay attention to sustainability in the use of AI Society, in particular must not be uniquely dependent on just one type of Al or a few specific types of AI. The Principle of Fair Competition fair competitive environment must be maintained in order to create new businesses and services, to maintain sustainable economic growth, and to present solutions to social challenges. Even if resources related to Al are concentrated in a specific country, we must not have a society where unfair data collection and infringement of sovereignty are performed under that country's dominant position Even if resources related to Al are concentrated into specific companies, we must using great many  not have a society where unfair data collection and unfair competition take place their dominant position The use of AI should not generate a situation where wealth and social influence are unfairly biased towards certain stakeholders The Principle of Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency In an AIReady Society it is necessary to ensure fairness and transparency in decisionmaking, appropriate accountability for the results, and trust in the technology so that people who use AI are not subject to undue discrimination with regard to personal background, or to unfair treatment in terms of human dignity. Under AIs design concept all people are treated fairly without unjustified discrimination on the grounds of diverse backgrounds such as race, gender nationality, age, political beliefs, religion, and so on. Appropriate explanations should be given on a casebycase basis depending on the application of Al and each particular situation, including such things as when AL is used, how the AI data is obtained and used, and what measures have been taken to ensure the appropriateness of results obtained from Al operations. In order for people to understand AIs proposals and make judgments on them, there should be appropriate opportunities for an open dialogue, as required, regarding the use, adoption, and operation of AI Taking into account the above viewpoints and in order to use Al safely in society, mechanism must be established to ensure trust in AI, and in the data and algorithms that support it The Principle of Innovation To realize Society . and aim for continuous innovation that advances aS people evolve together with AI development we should transcend boundaries such as national borders, industries, academia, governments, race, gender nationality, age, political convictions and religion We should promote total globalization, diversification and industryacademiagovernment cooperation in both human resources and research, based on a wide range ofknowledge, perspectives, ideas, and So on We must promote equal collaboration among universities, research institutions and companies, and the flexible movement of human resources. To implement AI efficiently and safely in society, methods for confirming the quality and reliability of AI, and for efficient collection and maintenance of data used by AI must be promoted. In addition to establishing Al engineering such as methods for the development and operation of AI,it is necessary to promote the establishment and development of a wide range of studies such as ethical and economic aspects of AI. To ensure the sound development of Al technology, while securing privacy and  using being testing  security, it is necessary to establish a platform environment where data from all fields can be effectively utilized across national borders without monopolized. In addition, to promote research on AI, RandD environments should be established where computer resources and highspeed networks that promote international collaboration and accelerate Al are shared and used. The government must proceed with regulatory reforms to reduce impeding factors in all related fields in order to establish an efficient and beneficial society with the aid of AI technologies  AIRandD and Utilization Principles We believe that developers and business operators of Al should establish and comply with the AI development and utilization principles based on the fundamental philosophy and social principles of Al outlined above. Since many countries, organizations, companies, and so on are currently discussing AI development and utilization principles, we believe it is important to create an international consensus quickly through open discussions, and share results internationally in a non regulatory, nonbinding framework  Conclusion In order to lead the world in building the first ALReady Society, Japan should share the principles herein with the government, related industries, organizations, and so 0n, and reflect them in government policies. In addition, Japan should share these principles with other countries around the world and take a leadership role in international discussions with the of establishing an ALReady Society worldwide. In doing so, Japan should present to the world a social image of Society . that supports the realization of the SDGs, and should contribute to cooperative and creative new development of the international community. These principles should be flexibly revised in the future according to the progress of AI related technologies, social changes, changes in the world situation, and many other factors  being goal  Appendix Establishment of the Council for Social Principles of Humancentric AI February ,  AI Strategy Expert Meeting for Strength and Promotion of the Innovation Decision .

Among those with a degree of familiarity to Al, concern about employee backlash due to the pace of change and job displacement tends to be an inhibitory factor.  Lack of Knowledge on Potential Use Cases. Perhaps another reason local industries and other organizations lack an understanding of the field of analytics is the scarcity of information on potential use cases of Al. While many concrete examples exist outside of the Philippines that are readily accessible via the news and from online resources, many local enterprises cannot connect or relate to these examples. Many still seem farfetched to local enterprises and the workforce. There is a need more potential use cases that are locally generated, so as to paint a more compelling picture for local stakeholders  Lack of Resources. The lack of resources is categorized into two forms equipment computational resources and manpower human resources. First, many enterprises, mostly micro, small, and medium enterprises MSMEs in the Philippines are resourcechallenged in terms of the capability to set up their own computational resource, including cloud computing resource, andlor even acquire business intelligence Bl software to aid them in their data and system analysis Second, most, if not all, industries in the country, especially those that have started to invest in Al and Data Science, have been restricted by the scarcity of data experts, which include data analysts, data scientists, machine learning engineers, data engineers, data architects, and data stewards, among others Furthermore, many of the dataskilled talents lack the required business skills to make Al RandD projects practical and profitable for the enterprises. Lack of Data Strategy. Data Strategy or Al strategy is essentially a vision for how organizations should invest their resources towards building capabilities in data science and Al, anchored particularly on each company's strategic imperatives and business objectives. A common misunderstanding is that a data strategy is all just about the data and the technology U e.g,, howlwhat to collect where to store, what Bl platforms to use, etc. Rather , it is about acquiring technologies and technical capabilities can help enterprises achieve their strategic It is potentially disastrous when organizations pour significant investments into digitization without charting their dataAl strategy in alignment with their own Many they they how goals.  NATIONAL AI STRATEGY ROADMAP FOR THE PHILIPPINES corporate vision. This could result in enormous monetary and opportunity losses This particular barrier is more prevalent in large enterprises that have the financial capacity to invest in digitization, which include the capability to solve use cases with ML, but do not have the right people who are both technically and business savvy to bridge the gap between technology and business  Uncertainties about Legal and Regulatory Framework for Al. By setting out ethical boundaries to prevent indiscriminate and nonrightsrespecting Al applications and protections for both customers and businesses, a clear legal and regulatory framework for Al will both protect the rights of Filipinos and spur responsible adoption of and innovations in Al. However, at the present, the Philippines lacks a complete framework for such Indeed, as far as Al has been in the public statements of lawmakers, more emphasis has been placed on its potential disruptive effects such as job losses, especially in the financially important BPO sector Fortunately, one component of the framework is currently present the Data Privacy Act of  Republic Act No.  , modelled after the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, offers robust protections for data privacy Filling in the missing pieces of the puzzle is now the next step.  NATIONAL AI STRATEGY ROADMAP FOR THE PHILIPPINES TheNational AL Strategy In , the Philippine Congress championed the approval of the Philippine Innovation Act Republic Act No.  , aiming to fund and support RandD efforts in the country towards national development The Act's main objective is to generate and scale up actions in all levels and areas of education, training research, and development towards promoting innovation and internationalization activities of micro, small and medium enterprises as drivers of sustainable and inclusive growth.' Consistent with the law the National Artificial Intelligence AI Strategy Roadmap was formulated to guide government and private sector stakeholders in employing Al technologies and developing Al economies, while being mindful of the potential consequences and impacts of algorithms to processes and business models Its overall focus is on how Al can be used to uplift the Filipino people, improve the productivity of local industries, and enhance the competitiveness of the national economy Among the Roadmap's main objectives are . To maintain the regional and global competitiveness of Filipino industries, noting that Al is one of the biggest drivers of innovation for enterprises  To identify areas in both RandD and technology application for investing both time and resources of government industry, and society, which includes harnessing existing global knowledge and new technologies that will aid in the development of new processes, products, and services for increasing productivity and for promoting overall public welfare  To recommend ways for effectively fostering a triplehelix RandD collaboration among government industry, and the academe, which is essential to national development 4 To suggest approaches for preparing the future workforce for the jobs of the future and . To attract the biggest industries to set shop in the country, and thus generating more jobs for the Filipino people. The Roadmap is organized according to pillars  , strategic dimensions , strategic imperatives  , and strategic tasks . The pillars and dimensions have been defined so as to ensure that the country has clear metrics in terms of tracking the progress of its implementation towards transforming the Philippines into a globally competitive Aldriven economy It is divided into two pillars based on the structure of the Global Al Index GAII.  The first pillar is Implementation which reflects the operationalization of Al by practitioners in business, government and communities. The second pillar is Innovation which reflects technology The Global Al Index.

Strategic dimensions comprise each pillar The first dimension is Digitization and Infrastructure as it is critical in achieving all the strategic goals defined in this Roadmap. The second dimension is Research and Development that includes as subset 'Investing in Strategic Sectors and 'International Collaboration.' The third dimension is the Workforce, which focus on anticipating and preparing for the potential impact of Al technologies by ensuring enough talents and skilled practitioners that can deliver Al solutions more on application and implementation and perform Al research academic and industrydriven This dimension will also cover both reskilling and upskilling of the workforce. Finally, the fourth dimension is Regulation, which protects human rights and puts into place equitable Al activating opportunities. Digitalization and Infrastructure Workforce Development, and Regulation fall under the Implementation pillar of the Roadmap, while Research and Development is under the Innovation pillar. Each of the strategic dimensions consists of strategic imperatives. For Digitization and Infrastructure, these are to  build a robust connected and networked environment and  improve data access and data value extraction For Workforce Development,  transform education and nurture future Al talents, and  upskill and reskill the workforce.

Build robust connected and networked environment The need for reliable and robust network and internet connection is paramount to the transformation of the Philippines into a knowledgebased economy This is crucial to support, sustain, and scale up Al and Data Science and Analytics DSA programs in the country. It is imperative that all localities should have fixed, reliable, and fast broadband speeds. The goal is for every household to have at least  Mbps download and upload capabilities and for critical zones economic, government offices, Higher Education Institutions HEIs , and Research Development Institutions RDIs to have internet speeds that are at least within the global averages for mobile and fixed broadband currently about  and  Mbps, respectively Strategic Tasks Build robust connected and networked environment  Make the internet equitable i.e. more affordable for everyone.

Improve data access and data value extraction Data accessibility be improved, and crosssector data utilization be supported as it powers Al. In addition to opening up public datasets, the government also needs to explore how private datasets can be tapped and, at the very least insights be democratized. MSMEs lament about the imbalance of power to larger companies due to data ownership and exclusivity To help MSMEs, academic institutions, and the general public in this aspect, it is proposed to have both a National Data Center NDC and National Research Cloud NRC The NDC will house and secure government private, and other publicly available datasets It will be a one stopdatashop for governments, universities, and enterprises. On the other hand, the NRC will provide our academic researchers and MSMEs shared Al resources such as supercomputers   NATIONAL Al STRATEGY ROADMAP FOR THE PHILIPPINES Strategic Tasks Improve data access and data value extraction 6 Make public data open, available, and digestible, for analysis DICT, FOI, AIl NGAs 7 Build a National Data Center NDC that will eventually be housed DOST, under the proposed National Center for Al Research.

In India, the National Strategy on Artificial Intelligence NSAI released by NITI Aayog in  highlights the potential of Al to solve social challenges faced by its citizens in areas such agriculture, health and education, in addition to the pure economic returns that are brought by this technology Since , the deployment of Al in India has only grown, through the support of enthusiastic state governments, research institutions, leading applications from the private sector and vibrant evolving Al startup ecosystem Though Al is often deployed with intentions of improving access and quality and higher efficiency and solving pressing problems, risks and challenges of leveraging A have also emerged across a number of different areas. Al is technology that continues to advance rapidly ad the discourse on Al ethics and governance is also evolving Globally, a number of different sets of Al ethics principles' have been put forward by multilateral organizations, sector entities and various nation states For India, these principles are grounded in the fundamental rights afforded to citizens by the Constitution Apart from establishment of principles however it is also necessary for India to frame means of implementing the principles across the sector private sector and academia in a manner that balances innovation and governance of potential risks. Building further on the National Strategy on Al, this approach paper the first part of the strategy titled Towards Responsible Al for All , aims to establish broad ethics principles for design, development and deployment of Al in India drawing on similar global initiatives but grounded in the Indian legal and regulatory context The second part of the strategy which will be released shortly explores means of operationalization of principles across the sector private sector and academia. Within this framework, it is hoped that Al can flourish, benefitting humanity while mitigating the risks and is inclusive bringing the benefits of Al to all The paper incorporates insights, feedback and experiences consolidated through inter ministerial consultations, largescale global multistakeholder consultations and a series of  consultations with Al ethics experts in India and globally, as well as wider public consultations, conducted over the last  months. This paper is meant to serve as an essential roadmap for the Al ecosystem, encouraging adoption of A in a responsible manner in India and building public trust in the use of this technology placing the idea of 'Al for All' at its very core February,  Owa New Delhi India Dr. Rajiv Kumar  7134FrTI  31T private public public   Contents Introduction  The Need for Responsible Al  Exploring the Ethical Considerations  Systems Considerations  Systems Consideration  Understanding the Al system's functioning for safe and reliable deployment  Systems Consideration  Postdeploymentcan the relevant stakeholders of the Al system understand why a specific decision was made?

NSAI while highlighting the potential of Artificial Intelligence AI for accelerating growth also emphasised the social potential of large scale adoption of Al with a focus on themes of inclusivity, adopting the theme of Al for All' . Towards promoting development as well as adoption of Al, the NSAI made broad recommendations for supporting and nurturing an Al ecosystem in India under four heads, a promotion of research b skilling and reskilling of the workforce c facilitating the adoption of Al solutions and d the development of guidelines for 'responsible Al' . While underlining the role of private sector and collaboration, NSAI identified focus sectors where the Government was expected to play the lead, viz. health, education, agriculture, smart cities and mobility NSAI recommended establishment of clear mechanisms to ensure that the technology is used in a responsible manner by instilling trust in their functioning as a critical enabling factor for large scale adoption in a manner that harnesses the best that the technology has to offer while protecting citizens Need for a fine balance between protecting society individuals and communities without stifling research and innovation in the field was underlined The future of Al is determined by a diverse group of stakeholders, including researchers, private organisations, Government standardsetting bodies, regulators and general citizens Around the world, various countries and organisations have defined principles to guide responsible management of Al for various stakeholders. 'Towards the Development of Responsible 'Al for All' , proposes principles for the responsible management of Al systems that may be leveraged by relevant stakeholders in India. Case studies of Al systems in India and around the  key  world are studied and the principles for responsible Al are derived from the Constitution of India and various laws enacted thereunder The case studies and considerations in this paper are limited in context to 'Narrow Al' solutions. have been grouped into two broad buckets 'Systems considerations' arising as a result of the system design choices and deployment processes, and have the potential to impact stakeholders interacting with a Al system and 'Societal' considerations, that are broader ethical challenges pertaining to risks arising out of the very usage of Al solutions for functions, and have potential repercussions on the society beyond the stakeholder interacting directly with specific systems. The Paper examines following system considerations Lack of understanding an Al system's functioning makes it difficult to reliably and safely deploy Al systems Challenges in explaining specific decisions of Al systems makes it difficult to trust them Inherent bias could make the decisions prejudiced against segments of population Potential for exclusion of citizens in Al systems used for delivering important services and benefits Difficulty in assigning accountability Privacy risks Security risks and following Societal Considerations Impact on Jobs Malicious psychological profiling The Supreme Court of India, in various cases such as Naz Foundation and Navtej Johar has defined the prevailing morality of our country to be based on the principle of Constitutional morality The Supreme Court has stressed time and on adherence to constitutional morality over social morality, with the formers reach extending beyond the mere text of the Constitution to encompassing the values of a diverse and inclusive society while remaining faithful to other constitutional principles The Paper studies the various  They specific specific again  considerations under the lens of the Constitutions and identifies 'Principles for Responsible Management of Artificial Intelligence in India' . On the basis of Systems and Societal considerations, the Paper identifies the following broad principles for responsible management of Al   Principle of Safety and Reliability  Principle of Equality 3 Principle of Inclusivity and Nondiscrimination 4 Principle of Privacy and security 5 Principle of Transparency 6 Principle of Accountability 7 Principle of protection and reinforcement of positive human values The manner and degree of implementation of principles must provide an enabling environment for promoting a responsible Al ecosystem in India. The measures may be suitably calibrated according to the risk associated with different Al applications in a manner that keeps pace with technology advances This is an evolving area of work NITI Aayog is already working on Part of the Paper that would provide the approach towards ongoing update of Principles and enforcement mechanisms of the responsible Al in the sector private sector and academia. This Paper is expected to be released shortly consider this document to be a critical step towards AlforAIl and hope it starts a dialogue on ensuring that the significant and transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence is used for the benefit of Indian citizens and humanity overall Amitabh Kant CEO, NITI Aayog specific public Wm  The Need for Responsible AI   The Need for Responsible Al rtificial Intelligence Al systems have gained prominence over the last decade due to their vast potential to unlock economic value and help mitigate social challenges Thus not only the development but also adoption of Al has seen a global surge in recent years It is estimated that Al has the potential to add USD  billion, or  percent of current gross value added to India's economy in . It is projected, that the Al software market will reach USD  billion by , up from USD . billion in . The rapid increase in adoption can also be attributed to the strong value proposition of the technology The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence NSAI has successfully brought Al in the centrestage of the reform agenda of the Government by underlining its potential to improve outcomes in sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, or education. Role that Al plays in facilitating improved scale of delivery of specialized services remote diagnosis or precision agriculture advisory and improved inclusive access to government welfare services regional language chatbots or voice interfaces implies a whole new for government interventions in these sectors. Further the NSAI underlines the need for a robust ecosystem that facilitates cutting edge research to not only solve for these societal problems and serve as the test bed of Al innovations but at the same time enable India to take a strategic global leadership by scaling these solutions globally As these factors continue to favour the increased application of Al to a variety of private and use cases, it is expected that Al usage will become ingrained and integrated with society In India, large scale applications of Al are being trialled everyday across sectors? .

NIRAMAI, a startup, has developed an earlystage breast cancer detection system using a portable, noninvasive, noncontact Albased device. Researchers from IIT Madras are looking to use Al to predict the risk of expectant mothers dropping out of healthcare programmes, to improve targeted interventions and increase positive healthcare outcomes for mothers and infants? . Box  Artificial Intelligence In this document, the scope and definition of Al is similar to the one mentioned in the National Strategy for Al,  NSAI,  a constellation of technologies that enable machines to act with higher levels of intelligence and emulate the human capabilities of sense, comprehend and act Computer vision and audio processing can actively perceive the world around them by acquiring and processing images, sound and The natural language processing and inference engines can enable Al systems to analyse and understand the information collected. An Al system can also take decisions through inference engines or undertake actions in the physical world. These capabilities are augmented by the ability to learn from experience and keep adapting over time. This paper studies the ethical implications of 'Narrow Al' , which is a broad term given to Al systems that are designed to solve challenges that would ordinarily require domain experts Both systems and societal considerations are explored from the perspective ofnarrow Al only Broader ethical implications of 'Artificial General Intelligence' AGI or Artificial Super Intelligence' ASI are not considered in this paper Further systems considerations considered in this document mainly arise from decisions taken by algorithms Artificial Intelligence real showstopper of Kumbh Mela    wwwwadhwaniai.orgworkmaternalnewbornchildhealth  wwwniramai.com   dia.html speech. specific   While the potential of these solutions to improve productivity, efficiency and outcome is well established, the NSAI  also advocated for managing the Al systems responsibly Around the world, instances of harm caused by deployment of Al systems have been realised Al systems appear to have prejudices in certain decisions and this amplified when used in large scale, such as when the system to allocate healthcare in the USA was found to discriminate against black people8. The blackbox nature of A and its 'selflearning' ability make it difficult to justify its decisions and in apportioning liability for errors. Al systems often lack transparency and the user is unaware that are dealing with a chatbot or an automated decisionmaking system, this awareness being to build trust with the user Safety and robustness of Al systems can pose serious challenges especially in high risk prone applications unequal access to Al powered applications for marginalized populations can further accentuate digital divide. According to a Capgemini report,  of the surveyed organisations in India have encountered ethical concerns from the use of A. There are also concerns of Al systems leading to job loss due to automation The usage of Al for malicious intent for e.g fakes to create misinformation have shown to have serious repercussions on society with instances of Al system enabled targeted propaganda, leading to social discord. The risks ofnot managing Al systems responsibly also has a significant economic impact Multiple firms placed a moratorium on facial recognition technology after issues around bias against specific population groups emerged? .

These typically result from system design choices, development and deployment practices and are studied under Systems considerations. For example, Al for cancer screening needs consideration for the patients privacy in its design b Indirect impactsdefined as implications caused due to the overall deployment of Al solutions in society This has potential repercussions on society beyond the stakeholder directly interacting with the system and are studied under Societal considerations. Such considerations may require policy initiatives by the Government This document examines the potential risks, followed by a study of legislative practices and technology approaches of managing them and goes on to recommend Principles for responsible management of Al systems. The Principles are expected to safeguard interest and also promote innovation through increased trust and increased adoption. Besides establishment of Principles there is a need to formulate enforcement mechanisms that would ensure the Principles are adopted across board, including the sector private sector and academia in a manner that balances innovation and potential risks. PartII of the series on Responsible Al for All will the enforcement mechanisms to translate Principles to practice. specific public public explore  Exploring the Ethical Considerations he considerations in this section were chosen on the basis of expert consultations, desk review of examples of Al deployment globally, and interviews with agencies deploying Al solutions in India. The causes for considerations may be deeply interconnected and, in some cases, partially overlapping Considerations have thus been divided in a manner that identifies distinct risks pose to various stakeholders.  they  Systems Considerations Box  The Blackbox problem While the advances in machine learning algorithms and techniques have greatly contributed to higher accuracy, the underlying Al systems have also become increasingly opaque Such systems have been successful in using a large number of features to make complex and sometimes consequential decisions but without exposing the underlying rationale. In traditional statistical approaches, human programmers influence the choice of parameters and the mechanism to influence a prediction In Al systems, input to the model called features are provided with the correct' output through annotated labels during the training The Al system then identifies the relationship between input features and the labels. Understanding this relationship becomes harder as the models become increasingly complex This manifests itself as the inability to fully understand an Als decisionmaking process and the inability to predict the Al's decisions or outputsalso known as the black box problem'  The blackbox problem does not exist for all forms of machine learning solutions, and there are means of performing similar functions using more rulebased techniques, although the accuracy may be significantly lower The accuracy vs interpretability tradeoff has limited the applicability of Al systems in several highstakes decision making One of the major global research efforts is around identifying models that are highly accurate and explainable.  . Bathaee, Yavar THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BLACK BOX AND THE FAILURE OF INTENT AND CAUSATION Harvard Journal of Law and Technology Volume , Number  Spring  .  arxiv orgpdf..pdf .   milprogramexplainableartificialintelligence  along  The considerations emerging from this property of deep learning technology manifest themselves in several ways. For example, it is difficult to establish if an Al system can be deployed safely and reliably without understanding and controlling how it works trusting an Al system's decision becomes a challenge if there is a disagreement due to lack of explanation improving a model performance is difficult when the root cause is unknown. Systems Consideration  Understanding the Al system's functioning for safe and reliable deployment As mentioned in Box , machine learning models learn by identifying relationships between input features and output labels. Model evaluation is typically done by holding out a portion of the datasets as a test dataset This may not necessarily reflect the various real world deployment scenarios and when the relationship between the input features and output is not understood, it becomes difficult to predict its performance in a new environment This makes it difficult to reliably deploy and scale such Al systems. The Issue Its Implications While accuracy gives a reasonable The system could pick spurious view into how a system performs, correlations, in the underlying data, understanding decision making leading to accuracy in test process is important to ensure safe datasets but significant errors in and reliable deployment deployment Box  Wolf or Husky? In an example referenced in Ribeiro et al,, ,an image classification algorithm performed reasonably well in its prescribed taskclassify the image of an animal as either a or a husky When the model was analysed, it was found that the system was classifying images based on the background and not the animal itself. While the model performed reasonably well on the data used to test it would clearly not do as well in the real world.   comcloudaiwhitepapersAl2OExplainability2OWhitepaperpdf .

Right Explanation shows that the model is looking at the environment for classification. Systems Consideration  Postdeploymentcan the relevant stakeholders of the Al system understand why a specific decision was made? While the previous consideration was on understanding the overall principles behind decision making, in certain cases, individual decisions may have significant impact and may require an explanation. There are various examples for such decisionscredit scoring, fraud detection, loan eligibility, insurance qualification, access to Government services, etc As algorithms make these decisions, very often, an end user has an expectation of factual assessment Particularly in blackbox systems, the user is sometimes neither aware of the inputs considered nor of the exact contours of the decision made by the algorithm. Such explanations also satisfy a strong imperative for reason giving, a component of procedural fairness in law. In addition to providing explanations, the deployment environment and stakeholders interacting with the Al system should also be considered The stakeholders may come from diverse backgrounds and the explanation offered by the system must be in a manner that can be understood by them It is also important to note that the stakeholders are not only limited to the users, but also audit agencies, regulatory bodies, standardsetting entities, people affected by the decisions, etc .

When Watson didn't agree, then physicians simply thought it was wrong This resulted in the system being abandoned in many hospitals around the world., Lack of understanding of in individual decisions has several consequences which discourages adoption, especially for consequential decisions. Individual decisions are difficult to audit by regulatory, standards and compliance agencies besides the lack of redressal available to an aggrieved recipient given the difficulty in determining the grounds for challenging it in a court of law For the developers of the system, identifying specific errors and making improvements to its performance is a challenge as the inability to track the source of the error makes targeting interventions difficult In cases where the law requires an explanation of individual decisions, it becomes prohibitive to use, even if the models are highly accurate . Forbes Time To The Al 'Black Box .  theconversation compeopledonttrustaihereshowwecanchangethat  deep specific specific help specifics Open  Systems Consideration  Consistency across stakeholders Though automated solutions are often expected to introduce objectivity to decision making, recent cases globally have shown that Al solutions have the potential to be 'biased' against sections of society This can lead to inconsistent output across a diverse demography who are otherwise similarly placed Real life manifestations of such bias tie into historically discriminatory behaviour where members of a certain caste, class, sex r sexual orientation, among others , are denied opportunities on the basis of an identifying characteristic even though are completely similar in all ways relevant to the decision being made The emergence of bias in Al solutions is attributed to a number of factors from various decisions taken across different stages of the lifecycle and the environment in which the system learns. In more rulebased machine learning techniques, the performance of the Al solution is largely dictated by the rules defined by its developers In deep learning methods, the performance of the solution is defined by the data used, models chosen, parameters used, defined, etc, and the inherent complexity of such models makes it difficult to identify sources of bias. While individual human decisions are not without bias, Al systems are of particular interest due to their potential to amplify its bias across a larger population due to largescale deployment The Issue Its Implications Different types of cognitive biases Large scale deployment of AI, have been identified and tend leads to a large number of high to be unfair' for certain groups frequency decisions, amplifying across religion, race, caste the impact of unfair bias. gender genetic diversity Leads to lack of trust and Since Al systems are designed disruption of social order and trained by humans, based on examples from realworld data, human bias could be introduced into the decisionmaking process   edublogtechtankhighlightsaddressingfairnessinthecontextofartifi cialintelligencel  specific they arising goals specific  Box  Bias in the real world Bias has already led to instances of discrimination in the real world. In  Amazon experimented a machine learningbased solution to evaluate applicants by observing patterns in resumes submitted to the company a previous year The system rated male applicants higher than females because historically, there was a higher number of male applications and trends in the data showed a historical preference for male candidates, as well In effect, Amazon's system taught itself that male candidates were preferable Another example that has made headlines recently was when a passport checker used Al to check if a person has blinkedi. This model, however had issues when checking people of Asian descent which was mostly attributed to the lack of Asian faces in the training dataset Systems Consideration  Incorrect decisions leading to exclusion from access to services or benefits Al systems are inherently probabilistic systems and it is uncommon to find systems that are  percent accurate in their predictions For consequential decisions, like the beneficiary identification system, criminal identification system, the social cost of an incorrect decision is very high and typical performance indicators may not be sufficient In a beneficiary identification system, an incorrect decision could lead to exclusion of services and benefits guaranteed by the State and in criminal identification systems, it could lead to loss of fundamental rights. When the Al systems are used, particularly for critical services by the Government, it is important to have processes and systems in place for raising an objection. The 'systematic' exclusion from access to services and benefits could undermine trust in the system General lack of awareness could also lead to overdependence due to false or exaggerated belief in such technologies automation bias and may further aggravate the problem. typical approach towards this is to introduce a human intervention whenever such consequential decisions are made. .   comarticlelusamazoncomjobsautomationinsightamazonscrapssecretairecruitingtool thatshowedbiasagainstwomenidUSKCNIMKO8G  .   periodzo. photo  The Issue Its Implications There are a variety of means of assessing lead to exclusion or evaluating the performance of an of citizens from services Al system Accuracy, precision, recall, guaranteed by the state sensitivity, etc In some cases, despite a high accuracy a system may fail in other measures Box  Ensuring no one is left behind Fraud Detection in Health Insurance National Health Authority NHA is the apex body responsible for implementing India's health insurance scheme under Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana PMJAY It is established at the national level and implementation is carried out by the State Health Agencies. Beneficiaries can avail cashless treatment at of the empanelled hospitals across India and PMJAY makes the payment directly to the hospital. The NHA includes a fraud detection cell atthe national level called National AntiFraud Unit NAFU and at the state level it is called State AntiFraud Unit SAFU A large number of transactions are processed for insurance claims on a daily basis. To detect and flag fraudulent transactions, Al systems are employed. Considering the high social cost of a potential incorrect decision, no treatment is stopped because of flagging by the Al system. When the Al system a case, the reasons for flagging is forwarded to the SAFU and investigated.

Systems Consideration  Accountability of Al decisions This consideration emerges mainly in more opaque forms of Al in which a decision, action or inaction of the system is influenced by a variety of parameters, such as data used for training, algorithms, processes, training parameters, deployment environment etc Different entities may be involved in each step of the development and deployment process In selflearning systems, the deployment environment itself could influence the decision process The 'many hands problem' , associated with complex computer systems, complicates the issue of assigning responsibility under extant regimes of accountability and legal recourse. Establishing cause of action is the first step of a civil suit and an opaque Al system coupled with a large number of interconnected factors behind individual decisions makes it difficult for attribution of errors and assigning liabilities. Examples of realworld instances of such issues is presented in Box  and Box and.

Systems Consideration  Privacy risks Al systems rely on large amounts of training data and when an individual's personal data is used there are bound to be considerable privacy concerns Lack of adequate privacy safeguards may permit technology to wholly record and analyse an individual's personal life without their consent or knowledge, significantly harming an individual interest by disregarding their preferences on the use of data. Such harm may be economic stealing an individuals credit card information or emotional where an individual's personal details is the subject of discussion.

The company trained Al models to recognise people from over  billion images scraped from social media platforms and provided the technology to law enforcement agencies. The company website states that their mission is to provide assistance to law enforcement agencies for the identification of criminals In many cases, law enforcement agencies have cited successin using the software to identify criminalsdespite having limited knowledge of how it works28. Several civil groups in the US have raised objections particularly around the known vulnerabilities in facial recognition technology and possibility of mass surveillance for malicious purposes. Social media sites from which data was scraped also issued ceaseanddesist' notice against the company for violating the terms and for data use., Model inversion Machine learning models may sometimes use sensitive and personal information for training and the model itself may be available for general use However research has shown ways in which the training data can be inferred from the trained model.

Systems Consideration  Security risks Security risks in Al systems arise from its reliance on data and from its design and deployment environment Some of these attacks are unique to machine learning systems and affect different parts of the machine learning development cycle.

Researchers have found, for example, that by carefully manipulating even less than one percent of an image, it was possible to cause the model to make mistakes in classification26.

This was facilitated through a Facebook app called This is your Digital Life' that users to take a psychological survey Users logged in through Facebook and the survey responses were captured along with the user's likes and information. In addition to this, the app also information on the user's Facebook friends. The allegation was that the data was used to create psychological profiles of users by corresponding answers to the survey with Facebook information This profiling was used to target political campaign messages. While this gained media attention for its role in the US Presidential elections, subsequently, its involvement in other countries was revealed This included its role in the Brexit campaign, elections in Thailand, Indonesia and its role in Indian elections. This episode was a watershed moment for data protection around the world Facebook confirmed that though only ,, users had provided consent and downloaded the app, by tapping into the users friends network, information of up to  million users was used. Of these, ,, users were from India38. It also highlighted the role of Al in enabling profiling and ease of spreading targeted messages It was alleged that the psychological profiling further helped in transmitting fake news to the susceptible population and was used as a 'propaganda machine' . This was seen as a violation of the fundamental user choice and democratic process around the world.

In certain highrisk sectors such as health and finance, various sector legal protections and guidelines for products and services exist However a simple applicability of these laws to Albased decisionmaking processes may not be appropriate For aspects of algorithmic decisions, new legal protections may be needed For example, while no antidiscrimination law directly regulates decision making by Al, the extant laws are equally silent about the means of decisionmaking that do govern41. Therefore , it will fall within the jurisdiction of antidiscrimination legislation to regulate decisions arrived at through the use of Al as well particularly when the decisionmaking Al is being used by an entity having constitutional or legal obligations to be unbiased In the study of regulatory and legal approaches, it is important to identify the role legislation may play The greatest risk of adopting this approach to manage Al systems is that regulations have historically not kept pace with technology Al is still an evolving field and the risks are not well understood, making it difficult to design concrete long term regulatory approaches. Regulating Al is a complex topic and there are diverse views regarding what degree and what forms of regulation will be effective for its varied applications. Al is a rapidly advancing technology, and a one size fits all approach may not be the most suitable approach. There is a need to balance soft governance measures with regulation depending on the use case and risks involved.  While . Responsible Al Global Policy Framework ITechLaw Available at  wwwitechlaw.orgResponsibleAV access .    specific specific they specific  overarching Al ethics principles will guide the overall design, development and deployment of Al in the country, a graded riskbased approach to varying use cases across different sectors need to be adopted At the same time, the Al ecosystem has multiple stakeholders private sector, research, government, legal bodies, regulators, standard setting bodies, etc It is important to bring in a common understanding on acceptable behaviour among different stakeholders and clarify applicability of existing policies and regulations through creation of Principles and guidance framework. Principles offer a technology agnostic framework for communicating expectations from responsible Al systems and identifying governance mechanisms Some relevant legislation for protection from Al related concerns exist in certain cases but would need to be adapted to cater to challenges posed by Al. Some sectors have unique considerations that may require sector laws for AI. Moreover the review of Al ethics principles and guidelines will need to be done on an ongoing basis given the rapid pace of development of this emerging technology Global Approaches Around the world, countries have identified a broad framework through Principles and other guidance documents to guide the design, development and use of Al systems Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Al released by the High Level Expert Group in the European Union is a nonbinding document that proposes a set of  requirements that Al systems should meet in order to be deemed 'trustworthy'  Along similar lines, Singapore has a Model Al Governance Framework44 and the United States of America has Principles for the Stewardship of Al Applications.  In addition to the overall guidance framework, actions have been identified in high risk sectors to guide their development and adoption These are also typically nonbinding and ensure that sectorspecific issues are considered.

In the USA, the Algorithmic Accountability Act of  is a proposed bill that requires specified commercial entities to conduct assessments of highrisk systems that involve personal information or make automated decisions, such as systems that use artificial intelligence or machine learning. The USA also has the HIPAA Privacy Rule  and Graham Leech Bliley Act  for the governance of data in healthcare and finance respectively Status in India Currently, India does not have an overarching guidance framework for the use of Al systems. Establishing such a framework would be crucial for providing guidance to various stakeholders in responsible management of Artificial Intelligence in India There are certain sector specific frameworks that have been identified for development and use of Al. In finance, SEBI issued a circular in Jan  to Stock Brokers, Depository Participants, Recognized Stock Exchanges and Depositories and in  to All Mutual Funds MFs Asset Management companies AMCs Trustee Companies Board of Trustees of Mutual Funds Association of Mutual Funds in India AMFI on reporting requirements for Artificial Intelligence Al and Machine Learning ML applications and systems offered and used.

India currently does not have overarching legislation specific to Al. The closest to this is the draft Personal Data Protection Bill  PDP designed as comprehensive legislation outlining various facets of privacy protections that Al solutions need to comply with. It covers limitations on data processing, security safeguards to protect data breaches and the provision of provisions relating to vulnerable users such as children Additionally, the PDP Bill provides for a vibrant data protection legislation where the law shall be supplemented with regulations and codes of practice, thereby making it easier for privacy to evolve with evolving technologies For example, if a certain aspect of privacy regarding Al requires clarity, the Authority may simply issue a code of practice to provide the same As of writing of this paper the PDP bill is yet to be passed The Information Technology Act,  IT Act is the backbone of data protection legislation in India.

It is also important for technology to respond to these expectations. The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence  advocates for leveraging technology to manage Al systems responsibly Technology has the potential to be agile and respond to evolving requirements. There has been a growing interest in using technology and statistical methods to address Alrelated considerationsincreasing not only the body of research in the field but also promoting a sense of responsibility amongst solution developers in academia and industry Figure shows the increase in the number of papers on 'ethical' topics is on the rise in Al, robotics and Computer Science related conferences in the last decade. The advances in this field are nascent, and must be promoted to pace with the general growth in some of the classical and trending topics in AI.

The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence  highlighted the need for collaborative research in Responsible Al. The Government may consider identifying relevant areas for research in responsible Al tools and techniques and incentivise creation and adoption   Principles for Responsible Management of Al Systems   Principles for Responsible Management of Al Systems he previous section identifies the need for guiding principles for responsible management of Al in India. The principles are expected to serve as a guide for various stakeholders in the Al ecosystem. These principles, to be effective, must be grounded on the nation's accepted value system and compatible with International standards. Different stakeholders of the Al ecosystem shape the future of Al, and it is essential to have a common set of principles which can guide all stakeholder groups towards responsible AI. Box  Al ecosystem stakeholder groups Different Groups shape the future of Al The Government Citizens Regulators Develop policies that may impact Al Influenced by Al systems, Oversee sector specificl sector agnostic Procure Al systems either directly or indirectly rules and regulations Private sector Research Community Standard Setting Bodies Develop Al products and solutions Research across social sector Set standards for research or technology Use Al products and solutions regulation technologies that use Al. Ex BIS,RDSO innovation in AI Security auditors Assess security of computer networks A common set of principles across these entities helps ensure Al is used beneficially The Supreme Court of India Supreme Court in cases such as Naz Foundation and Navtej Johar, has defined the prevailing morality of our country to be based on the principle of Constitutional morality The Supreme Court has stressed time and again on adherence to constitutional morality over social morality,  and may  with the former's reach extending beyond the mere text of the Constitution to encompassing the values of a diverse and inclusive society while remaining faithful to other constitutional principles Constitutional morality has been described as the basis on which the rights of minorities can be in the face of majoritarianism, and is to be followed over societal morality, especially when the latter infringes the basic rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India Constitution. Box  Considerations in the context of Constitution of India The considerations mentioned in the previous section also find expression in the Constitution under Fundamental Rights The relevant articles are summarized below, Article  RighttoEquality The Constitution guarantees equal treatment of equally placed persons and groups before the law, and equal protection of the law to all. Articles   and  Right against Discrimination The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion, race caste, sex, descent, place of birth or residence in matters of education, employment, access to spaces, etc While the Constitution prohibits discrimination based on certain markers, it also provides for positive discrimination in the form of affirmative action Article , while prohibiting discrimination, empowers the Government to make provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, and to make provisions for their admission to educational institutions, whether private, aided or unaided Article  Right to Life and Healthcare The Constitution guarantees the right to life to all persons. Various High Courts have read the right to healthcare, including the right to avail health insurance, to be part of the right to life. Article  Right to Privacy The Supreme Court has held that the right to privacy is an intrinsic part of  upheld public special  the right to life and guaranteed under Article  of the Constitution and as part of the freedoms enshrined in Part IIl thereof. Article 38 State Directive for Economic Equality The Constitution directs the State to ensure economic welfare of the people and minimise inequalities in income, status, facilities and opportunities, both between individuals and between groups of people. The State is also directed to ensure a wage for all workers, including agricultural workers. Tansparency and accountability The Supreme Court, in its interpretation of the Constitution, has held that transparency in decision making is critical even for private institutions. The Constitution guarantees accountability of all State action to individuals and groups. Box  Creation of Principles Principles were developed after consultation with diverse set of stakeholders Al case studies in India and Instances of harm caused by Al systems around the world were studied to identify around the world relevant considerations in Indian context Supreme court in various instances, has defined the prevailing morality of India to Rights according to the Indian be based on the principle of Constitutional morality. Principles thus flow from the Constitution constitution and all laws enacted thereunder Various International bodies such as GPAI, UNESCO, IEEE have developed International standards for Al standards for AI. For effective global collaboration on Al, it is important for India' principles to be compatible with relevant international standards Ethics is an emerging field and should be an ongoing research The considerations were identified following several expert interviews and multistakeholder workshops with experts from India and globally across and private sectors, startups, academia and civil society The Principles may be derived from the Constitution and all laws enacted thereunder The following Principles are recommended for the responsible management of artificial intelligence in India and are based on the underlying principle of ensuring Al systems are designed in a manner that enables fundamental rights  liberty living public  1 Principle of Safety and Reliability Al should be deployed reliably as intended and sufficient safeguards must be placed to ensure the safety of relevant stakeholders. Risks to all stakeholders should be minimized and appropriate grievance redressal, care and compensation structures should be in place, in case of any unintended or unexpected harm The Al system needs to be monitored through its lifecycle so it performs in an acceptable manner reliably, according to the desired goals.  Principle of Equality Al systems must treat individuals under same circumstances relevant to the decision equally . Principle of Inclusivity and Nondiscrimination Al systems should not opportunity to a qualified person on the basis of their identity It should not deepen the harmful historic and social divisions based on religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth or residence in matters of education, employment access to spaces, etc It should also strive to ensure that unfair exclusion of services or benefits does not happen. In case of an adverse decision, appropriate grievance redressal mechanism should be designed in a manner affordable and accessible to everyone irrespective of their background. . Principle of Privacy and Security Al should maintain privacy and security of data of individuals or entities that is used for training the system Access should be provided only to those authorized with sufficient safeguards. . Principle of Transparency The design and functioning of the Al system should be recorded and made available for external scrutiny and audit to the extent possible to ensure the deployment is fair honest, impartial and guarantees accountability . Principle of Accountability AII stakeholders involved in the design, development and deployment of the Al system must be responsible for their actions. Stakeholders should conduct risk and impact assessments to evaluate direct and indirect potential impact of Al systems on end users, set up an auditing process internal and if required external to oversee adherence to principles and create mechanisms for grievance redressal in case of any adverse impact  deny public  . Principle of protection and reinforcement of positive human values Al should promote positive human values and not disturb in any way social harmony in community relationships It is important to ensure that these Principles are updated in the future to reflect the latest knowledge, innovation and technology advances.

It offers sectoragonistic guidelines that require Al practitioners to respect the proportionality between means and ends, and carefully create a balance between competing interests and objectives It also states that the development deployment and use of Al systems must account for both substantive and procedural fairness. Under General Data Protection Regulation,  GDPR, entities processing personal data or determining the means for the processing of personal data are required to implement technical and organisational measures that ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk involved in processing such personal data These measures include the pseudonymization and encryption of data preserving the confidentiality, integrity and resilience of processing systems and services and restoring the availability of, and access to, personal data in a timely manner The EU Cybersecurity Act,  Cybersecurity Act entrusts the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity ENISA with the responsibility of developing certification frameworks for cybersecurity, including the development of sectoral frameworks for cybersecurity with regards to products. In a white paper on Artificial Intelligence, the European Commission highlighted the importance of suitably amending the Product Liability Directive to enhance security related aspects for AI. The paper noted that the existing product safety legislation already protects against all kinds of risks arising from the product according to its use, including Al products. However it noted that certain amendments may be introduced in the Product Liability Directive to address risks arising out of new technologies These amendments include   risk assessment human oversight at the time of design, requirements addressing the risk of faulty data at the design stage and provisions discussing and requesting cooperation between economic operators in the supply chain to ensure that safety standards are adequately preserved. Singapore The privacy and security regime in Singapore is consolidated under a single law the Personal Data Protection Act,  PDPA Regulating privacy issues in Al is rooted in two core data protection principles, consent obligation and purpose limitation. The Personal Data Protection Commission PDPC is Singapore's data protection regulator PDPC published a revised Model Artificial Intelligence Governance Framework Framework in , containing a roadmap for data protection compliance for organizations deploying AI The PDPA also requires an organization to protect personal data in its possession or under its control by employing such reasonable security arrangements' to prevent unauthorized access to data and mitigate similar risks. These arrangements also intend to cover an assessment of the adequacy of existing safeguards, with the PDPC stressing the importance of covering all foreseeable scenarios that can potentially lead to a data breachsecurity risk to the personal data. Towards this, it proposed a framework that stressed on the importance of having a 'human in the loop' or a 'human over the loop' based on the degree of severity and harm occasioned by the particular processing of personal data. The equivalent data protection standard for crossborder transfers is also adopted by the PDPA Businesses deploying Al systems in a manner that moves personal data from one jurisdiction to another must ensure that the entity receiving such data is bound by a series of safeguards that provide the same standard of data protection as the PDPA itself. The Model Al Governance Framework Model Framework , was drafted based on a discussion paper issued by the Personal Data Protection Commission and part of Singapore's National Al Strategy.

It focuses on prospective accountability by making internal governance processes robust and demonstrating to customers and regulators that the entity has employed practices to foster accountability among the designers and operators of Al, and to ensure that the Al systems, applications and algorithms are transparent and fair in their operation, while providing information and explanation to consumer about where and how Al is being used with respect to their data or services and products made available to them. In , the Monetary Authority of Singapore MAS published the Principles to Promote Fairness, Ethics, Accountability and Transparency in the Use of Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics in Singapore's Financial Sector FEAT Principles specifically aimed at the use of Al for financial services The FEAT Principles have identified the proactive disclosure of the use of Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics AIDA to data subjects as a principle to ensure transparency in the context of data protection for AI USA The US government through Executive Order  in February , issued a series of directions to various federal stakeholders to develop and principles that promote advancement of Al based technology while also protecting civil liberties. Pursuant to this Executive Order the White House in January , issued a set of  'Principles for the Stewardship of Al Applications, which called for among others, fairness and nondiscrimination to be priorities for agencies drafting and implementing regulations on Al. Unlike Singapore and the EU, the US lacks an overarching federal legislation on privacy However various sector laws regulate aspects of privacy The state of California, which has recognized privacy as a constitutional right, enacted a comprehensive legislation , the California Consumer Privacy Act,  CCPA providing for certain safeguards that directly affect Al systems.

Model cards are aimed at both experts and nonexperts. Developers can use them to design applications that emphasize a model's strengths while avoiding or informing end users of its weaknesses For journalists and industry analysts, might provide insights that make it easier to explain complex technology to a general audience And might even help advocacy groups better understand the impact of Al on their communities. Google has designed examples for two features of its Cloud Vision API, Face Detection and Object Detection. provide overviews of both models' ideal forms of input, visualize some of their limitations, and present basic performance metrics. Both are early proofs of concept, to advance the conversation around the value of transparency in Al. Datasheets for Datasets The machine learning community currently has no standardized process for documenting datasets, which can lead to severe consequences in highstakes domains To address this gap, Microsoft proposed datasheets for datasets In the electronics industry, every component, no matter how simple or complex, is accompanied with a datasheet that describes its operating characteristics, test results, recommended uses, and other information. By analogy, it is .  arxivorgpdf.pdf .  withgoogle comabout  they they They key  proposed that every dataset be accompanied with a datasheet that documents its motivation, composition, collection process, recommended uses, and SO on. Datasheets for datasets will facilitate better communication between dataset creators and dataset consumers, and encourage the machine learning community to prioritize transparency and accountability  Fact Sheet The of IBMs Fact Sheet project is to foster trust in Al by increasing transparency and enabling governance Increased transparency provides information for Al consumers to better understand how the Al model was created. This allows a consumer of the model to determine if it is appropriate for their situation. AI Governance enables an enterprise to specify and enforce describing how an Al model or service should be constructed and deployed. This can prevent undesirable situations, such as a model training with unapproved datasets, models having biases, or models having unexpected performance variations A Fact Sheet is a collection of relevant information facts about the creation and deployment of an Al model or service. Facts could range from information about the purpose and criticality of the model, measured characteristics of the dataset model, or service , or actions taken during the creation and deployment process of the model or service. .  .   goal policies  7c4id  NITI Aayog"

However this is just the beginning Al has the potential of upending how we conduct our lives, how the economy is transacted, and how our communities are organized. In this document we provide an overview of Al in the context of Qatar as a country, identify the pillars to build a great Al research and innovation ecosystem in Qatar and follow those with recommendations for action Our vision is to have Al so pervasive in all aspects of life, business and governance in Qatar that everyone looks up to Qatar as a role model for seamlessly transitioning into an AlX future. Qatar AlX Future Race for Talent Al Augmented Jobs Knowledge Economy Strong academic and Encourage local businesses Attractive jurisdiction experiential learning to embrace new Al solutions. to incorporate Aldriven curriculum for the AlX businesses future. Invest in people and their Lead and participate in ideas for Qatar's future international efforts to Doha as a global hub through training, immersive standardize the use of Al for attracting Al talent experiences and startup funds Data and Computing Infrastructure Launch and lead multilateral level diplomatic efforts for datasharing among countries with small populations. Worldclass cloud and computing infrastructure with strict dataresidency requirements. Ethics and Governance of AI Strong Al Ethics and Governance framework rooted in local context and aligned to international norms. Guidelines for the level of explainability required for different types of decisions made by Al algorithms key  INTRODUCTION Qatar needs an overarching Al strategy that supports the national vision and is rooted in its local context The goal of this strategy is to leverage Al to secure Qatar's economic and strategic future, as envisioned in QNV2030,and prepare the society for effective adoption of Al technology that is aligned with local needs and traditions. The Al Strategy is structured around six thematic pillars which together will guide Qatar to transform itself for an AlX Future. The moniker AlX refers to the emerging consensus that Al technology will permeate into all secular aspects of human endeavors health, entertainment business activity, education and research. Modern Al is predicated on the use of data as a strategic resource. Raw data needs to be coupled with technological capability to produce new Aldriven products which will transform the normative basis of how societies operate and function. Having invested heavily in an education and research infrastructure, Qatar is poised to play a leadership role in an AlX Future. THE GLOBAL AI RACE Artificial Intelligence Al is a transformative technology of the 21st century and one of the main arenas in which nations of the world will compete The CEO of Google has stated that Al may be more important than fire or electricity This is an exaggeration, but it has become very clear that Al will transform all facets of human society education, healthcare, transportation, business, entertainment warfare, and more. The origins of Al lie in the USA and the most recent developments in the field have come from North America However other countries are vying for Al superpower status. China aims to be the global leader in Al by  and is investing heavily to achieve this goal, especially in the use of Data as a strategic asset. Countries such as Canada, Japan and the UK have also adopted Al strategies that aim at global leadership. Other countries such as Denmark Taiwan, and South Korea have developed Al strategies that do not necessarily aim at global leadership, but rather at promoting the use of Al throughout society and developing Al solutions for local needs'. Increasing local Al adoption is the beginning of a journey to become competitive as a society in the global economy The leadership in many advanced countries have concluded that capacity building in Al technology is vital for a sustainable and viable economy As Al's leverage increases in a connected world economy, we will increasingly see a winner takes all trend dominating in businesses. This will have a serious implication on how nations, organizations, or even individuals think about building Al capacity and applications that are viable. In a world where innovative ideas and software can originate anywhere and thrive, excellence is not just a lofty goal to achieve but a necessary requirement There is no escape from excellence in the impending Al future  National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Qatar WHY QATAR SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN THE AI RACE Qatar is a forward looking nation and has a clearly stated vision of using its economic advantage derived from fossil fuels to transform itself into a knowledgebased economy Indeed, the investments that Qatar has already made in research and development efforts in Al can serve as a foundation to build strong capabilities in the area and provide a head start to make globally recognized Albased solutions. For Qatar following are the threats and opportunities in an Al future Threats In Qatar economic diversification has been identified as an inescapable step towards becoming knowledgedriven society This implies that Qatar must become globally competitive in selective niche areas. As Al permeates into all sectors f human activity, not competing in the Al arena will significantly hurt Qatar's plans of diversification. Alenabled automation will have a profound impact on the employment landscape in all countries As Qatari citizens are overwhelmingly employed in administrative white collar occupations, the threat of job tasks becoming susceptible to automation is very real in Qatar Opportunities Qatar has a small educated and information technology savvy population. Using Al derived automation to augment human capability that enhances both capacity and capability of the Qatari workforce is entirely possible in a reasonably short time horizon. By making judicious investment in Al technology, Qatar can accrue downstream benefits by owning the future means of production.  Al SPRING BIG DATA, ALGORITHMS, AND CLOUD The term Artificial Intelligence is not new It was coined in the summer of  by a group of renowned American scientists?. However the field of Al in its early days had a history of overpromising and under delivering The public in the 's and 's were fascinated by promises of thinking machines that can understand language play chess, and diagnose diseases, only to be disappointed when none of these predictions materialized in a meaningful way This led to periods of disenchantment with Al and withdrawal of funding for Al projects, the so called Al Winters. Since the 1990s Al has been able to deliver on its promises and there has been a much better understanding of its capabilities and its limitations. A narrow form of Al grounded in data has taken root and won over skeptics. Al was finally able to beat a world chess champion, drive a car autonomously, and defeat the two greatest champions in the Jeopardyl game show. Al became an integral part of many technologies such as web search engines, natural language processing, logistics optimization, robotics, and medical diagnosis. The period since  onwards can be truly called an Al Spring Al is no longer a technology component, but rather the main enabler for many business and scientific solutions, from image recognition to self driving cars to targeted political advertisements. The confluence of Big Data, algorithms and access to cheap computing power through cloud computing has created The Virtuous Cycle Enabling Al Revolution Computing power Big Data Computers become Over the last two years increasingly powerful alone  of the data in and inexpensive the world was generated every year Al Algorithms New algorithms learn from many data examples but require extensive computing power  PILLARS OF QATAR'S AI STRATEGY The National Al strategy of Qatar has six pillars education data access, employment business, research, and ethics It envisions two roles for Qatar First Qatar must become capable of producing world class Al applications in areas of national interest and have a business environment enabling the use Al as a driver for innovation. Second, Qatar must be an efficient consumer of Al, with a properly educated citizenry, sound laws, and ethical guidelines. The national Al strategy would be a powerful technological enabler for the Qatar National Vision . QNV  is itself organized around four pillars economic, social, human, and environmental, and Al is indispensable for all the four pillars. For example, the economic pillar calls for the development of a 'knowledgebased economy By investing in Al education and homegrown Al solutions, the effort to ground the economy on knowledge capital can be accelerated Similarly, developing an endogenous Albased capacity for promoting transportation efficiency can help reduce pollution and foster environmental development There are six pillars that we have identified for Qatar's Al strategy These cover all aspects of Al relevant to Qatar and provide a framework for organizing action plans and investments in the future  Pillar  Race for Talent in the AlX Era Developing and even using Al technology requires special skills that are in short supply all over the world. Al is likely to be embedded in all aspects of human activity, a phenomenon that can be called AlX. There is massive demand for Al talent driving up salaries and creating intense competition among companies to hire in Al related roles such as data scientists and software engineers. Data science and Al courses at major universities and through online providers attract literally thousands of students Thus, the first pillar of Qatar's national Al strategy should be education and training Qatar is uniquely positioned to reap the benefits of Al. More than  of the Qatari population uses the Internet one of the highest rates in the world. Widespread Internet usage indicates that Qatari citizenry is constantly being exposed to Alenabled technology including computer vision, language and speech processing and digital maps. When it comes to Al, the future has already arrived. Designing and producing Alproducts that are optimized for local needs and usage is not as farfetched as it might seem and can be enabled by necessary education and training AlX Paradigm Al education should be an integral part of the curriculum at all educational levels in all disciplines. At the K level, younger students should learn to deal with the recommendations of Al. For example, Al typically provides its recommendations in the form of probabilities, so students should learn the basics of decisionmaking in the face of uncertainty The move away from sensebased towards intellectual perception is rooted in medieval Islamic philosophys. Students should also learn about interacting with Al as part of their environment For example, learning to reject the recommendations of Al that clearly disagree with common sense. Older students should have the opportunity to learn technical and philosophical aspects of Al. It is also important to teach the teachersabout Al by developing professional learning courses or online training At the university level, computingrelated departments should prepare their graduates for careers in STEM and Al disciplines. Other academic departments should be attuned to the use of Al in their disciplines and educate their graduates to be prepared when encounter it Al education also encompasses Al coursesor boot camps that prepare those already in the workforce to work in Alrelated jobs, especially if their current jobs can be replaced by Al. In addition, management and executive training that educates business leaders on the necessary basics of Al should be availables. Finally, in addition to growing Iocal Al talent Qatar should attract top Al international talent in education, research, and entrepreneurship by introducing fasttrack residency permits and creating a techfriendly investment environment RECOMMENDATIONS Develop a strong academic and experiential learning curriculum for the AlX future i.e, projects activity driven for K to build local capacity for managing interactions with Al, imaginingplanning Al solutions from a young age, and building strong foundations in computational methods and STEM curriculum to develop Al applications in the future. Quantify the amount of necessary talent required in STEM disciplines to inculcate an Al ecosystem Design degree programs with inbuilt apprenticeship pathways e.g, Al based medicine where students can interact with researchers and businesses for building Qatarrelevant Al applications Promote a vibrant research and entrepreneurship ecosystem for innovative Al applications that naturally align with Qatar's national interest Adopt strategies for attracting top Al talent from all over the world such as internationally competitive incentives, fasttrack residency, easy yet wellregulated data access to facilitate innovation, and policies to encourage integration of locally developed Al solutions. they  National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Qatar Pillar  Data Access is Paramount The current Al revolution is based on Big Data, and modern Al models require large amounts of data to train them Data is the key asset that underpins the resurgence in Al and its usage and release needs to be strategically shepherded One way for Qatar to quickly gain an Al advantage is to develop data governance rules and guidelines that facilitate broad access to and sharing of data consistent with the recently released Qatar Data Privacy Laws? . Data sharing among organizations or even within an organization is impeded by two considerations. First data has strategic and monetary value to the organization there is a saying that data is the new oil8 Second, data sharing can violate the privacy of users. People with data are justifiably worried about these two considerations when they share data, so the tendency is not to share Data release and sharing needs to be driven by a strategic imperative of enabling and promoting local Al ecosystem For example, China has been at the forefront of using data as a strategic tool to promote indigenous technology Data is the new source code and this perspective needs to be adopted by decisionmakers in Qatar Qatar has the unique advantage of being a small country that is well connected administratively This makes development of broad data sharing guidelines possible, and it can be one of the competitive advantages of Qatar in the area of AI. RECOMMENDATIONS Qatar should create a data strategy office responsible for educating government and business organizations and developing guidelines for the use of data as a strategic resource. Qatar should develop guidelines for data sharing that encourage people with data to share it and make clear the best practices for doing so. The guidelines should spell out the obligations of the receiver of the data. For government entities, these guidelines can be elevated to be mandatory policies. Qatar should launch and lead multilateral level diplomatic efforts for datasharing among countries with small populations. For most countries including Qatar developing successful Al applications that can generate export revenue won't be possible without greater data sharing at a global level. There is no such multilateral initiative in the world, hence this is an opportunity for Qatar to take a leadership role Being a small country with a very diverse population, Qatar should leverage locally collected data by integrating and curating in ways that allow it to be repurposed and hence democratizes development of novel futuristic applications.  Pillar  The Changing Landscape of Employment There is an intense ongoing debate among experts about the impact that Al technology will have on the future of employment and jobs in the coming years. The extreme view is that Al technology will result in massive employment disruption as many tasks that currently require human involvement have the potential of being replaced by Al. In a highly cited work carried out by researchers at Oxford University, over  of jobs in the US are under risk of becoming automated? Economic theory suggests that the longterm financial returns on capital tend to be higher than labor and thus those who own capital will benefit disproportionately from Al technology This has the potential of causing social upheaval and disequilibrium. The impact of Al technology on Qatar is likely to be very different from what other countries may experience In fact Qatar can leverage the Al revolution to realize its vision of transforming into knowledge based economy by carefully investing in strategically important Al technologies Qatar is home to around . million people out of which approximately  are local Qataris and the rest are nonQataris who reside in the country specifically on the basis of employment Most Qataris working outside the military and security forces have whitecollar occupations, primarily in the public sector Many of these whitecollar jobs are, in principle, susceptible to outright Al replacement or Al augmentationo . For example, according to the  Qatar Labor Survey,  of the Qatari male and  of the Qatari female workforce is employed in clerical positions . Singleskill whitecollar positions such as these are most susceptible to automation However nearly  of economically active Qataris have a university education one of the highest rates in the world. By embracing Al and encouraging its citizens to be Alskilled, Qatar can become one of the first countries in the world where citizens and Al technology can work together in harmony Sidra Medicine   National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Qatar Consider the example of Qatar's burgeoning medical tourism industry Qatar is ranked 30thin the world1z for medical tourism and is rapidly developing a worldclass medical infrastructure with several hospitals having already obtained highly sought after international accreditation. Al technology can help Qatar accelerate the growth in medical tourism and provide knowledge jobs for Qatari citizens and residents. For example, international standards for the ratio of nurses to patients range from  to  depending on the nature of the medical treatment However many of the procedural tasks that a nurse carries out, like checking patient health parameters and delivery of medication, can be automated by existing Al technology The replacement of these tasks will not only be costefficient but will lead to higher quality of service as machines are likely to make fewer human errors . Similarly Qatar is home to people from over eighty countries and there are at least eight large subpopulations which speak distinct languages An Albased speech and language translation system for medical communication can be built bottom up in Qatar and exported to the rest of the world. However the more humaninteraction aspects of the nurse and patient relationship cannot be automated and Qatari residents can be trained to carry out this particular aspect of the nursing function Thus, the augmentation of a nurse's job with Al technology can be used to admit more patients per nurse, provide higher quality of care, and create specialized knowledgeintensive jobs. History shows that once the cost of using a new technology falls below a certain threshold then that technology rapidly permeates through society13. It is hard to predict what new applications will emerge that will take advantage of the emerging Al technology What remains constant is that economics is often the driver of technology adoption One of the factors affecting the cost of adopting Al in Qatar compared to other countries is the ability of Qatar to import low cost labor from the developing world. Thus, the cost of labor intensive and inefficient solutions is often less than the cost of an Al solution leading to a situation where longterm efficiencies are sacrificed for shortterm benefits. RECOMMENDATIONS Provide financial incentives to local businesses to embrace new Al solutions and resist the temptation of using loWcost labor as a substitute for embracing Al technology Educate Train Qatari citizens in managing, building and investing in Al solutions for continuously improving the standards of living and economic productivity in Qatar key  Pillar  New Business and Economic Opportunities Qatar has a modern diverse, technologydriven business landscape. Besides a world leading oil and gas industry, Qatar is home to a major international airline, an influential financial sector and a robust power generation enterprise. Al will transform the economic and business landscape in Qatar and the national Al strategy should address this transformation Al is already being adopted by businesses worldwide McKinsey estimates that global technology companies such as Google and Baidu spent a total of S20 billion on Al in . These technology companies are the early adopters of Al, but investment in Al is also happening in other sectors such as financial services, manufacturing, and agriculture Early adopters are already seeing the benefits of Al, which is accelerating adoption by other companies. The national Al strategy of Qatar should enable existing businesses to adopt Al, and catalyze the creation of new businesses based on Al technology For example, the Qatari government can provide guidelines and best practices for businesses that plan to adopt Al, or even direct financial and technical assistance to these businesses to help them in adopting Al technologies. Startup funds and incubators should be directed to focus on Albased companies. Since data is essential for modern Al, enabling access to the data that businesses need for developing their Al models can be a major driver of the adoption of Al in businesses. The other component of modern Alis a powerful computing infrastructure. This infrastructure can be partly provided by the private sector but the government needs to play a role in ensuring that the computing infrastructure available to businesses is powerful enough to meet the demands of Al. For example the internet connectivity within Qatar and internationally should support the capacity requirements of Al. The government can accelerate the adoption of Al in the business sector by adopting Al in its own public services That way businesses interfacing with Alenabled public services will feel the need to become Alenabled themselves In addition, Alenabled public services can be a quick success for Al that is felt by Qatari citizens. The Qatari government has a solid foundation on which to base Al adoption in public services, since Qatar already has a strong digital government with services such as Metrash, Hukoomi and BaladiyaOun. It is befitting to augment these services with Al capabilities, resulting in more efficient service delivery that better responds to citizens' needs. RECOMMENDATIONS Make investment commitments to develop programs for leveraging Al in areas of strategic importance for Qatar e.g., oil and gas. Build a regulatory and incentive framework that is stable, and makes Qatar an attractive jurisdiction to incorporate by Al driven businesses around the globe Develop and maintain cutting edge computing and connectivity infrastructure with a high degree of resilience. Launch and participate in international efforts to bring standardization in all aspects of AI, e.g, network and systems architecture data and application integration protocols, requirements on test case coverage, services, etc. that ensure a level playing field.   National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Qatar Pillar  Qatar Al  X Focus Areas In some cases,it is appropriate to procure existing Al solutions and deploy them in Qatar However there will be cases where it is imperative to develop local homegrown Al solutions. The reason can be that the solution addresses specific local needs of Qatar that Qatar is uniquely positioned to be a global leader in developing the solution, or that the solution is highly strategic and must be controlled locally Qatar must ensure it has global Al research leadership in areas of national interest and that local technology enterprises have sufficient technical capacity to develop Al solutions. Some example areas where it is imperative for Qatar to develop local Al solutions are as follows Arabic Language Processing As an Arabic speaking country, the use of Al Arabic language processing should be a national priority for Qatar Qatar has a wealth of content in Arabic that can be used to develop Al models, and Arabic language processing capabilities can enable impactful applications in education, media, security, and other areas of strategic importance. To illustrate, Qatar Computing Research Institute QCRI has developed multiple Arabic language processing systems such as an automatic speechtotext system for Arabic that is in use by the Al Jazeera media network, a suite of Arabic text processing tools known as Farasa that is considered the best in the world, and a powerful ArabictoEnglish translation system Qatar can be a world leader in the use of Al for Arabic language processing and generation. National Security Cyber security has become an Al problem. Advanced techniques for identifying and mitigating cyber threats depend to a high degree on data analytics and AI. Additionally, using Al to analyze publicly available data can provide advanced warning of threats. Such highly strategic infrastructure should rely on homegrown and locally controlled solutions. Signals from socialmedia now constitute a major focus of attention by intelligence agencies around the world to infer security threats to a nation. By building local systems, which correlate network, and social media traffic can go a long way in creating another layer of security for Qatar Precision Medicine and Systems Biology Al will radically transform the way healthcare and medicine is practiced. The holy grail of personalized and precision medicine and the concept of from bench to bedside is realizable with AI. A consensus is emerging within the medical research community that a systems biology perspective which harnesses multiomic genomic, proteomic, metabolomics data is necessary to make next generation medical breakthroughs The Qatar Genome Project provides finegrained data about citizens f Qatar and should serve as the basis of uncovering persistent disease patterns in the local population A high rate of consanguinity in the local population makes the Qatar genome data highly unique and its usage and release needs to be strategically guided. More lifestyle and clinical data can be acquired from wearable devices, electronic health records and even social media. High quality data with world class medical and bioinformatics research infrastructure including Hamad Medical Corporation, Sidra Medicine WeillCornell MedicineQatar QBRI, and QCRI, can catapult Qatar to the forefront of personalized medicine, emergency services, and Al based medical education and research.  for along  Transportation and FIFA World Cup  Qatar is undergoing a rapid expansion in transportation infrastructure, whether it is road networks, the new Hamad Port and Airport and expansion of Qatar Airways and Qatar Rail. This is a unique opportunity to in place Alenabled infrastructure from the get go. Additionally, Al can help in managing the logistics challenges of World Cup ,and enhance the experience of fans in the stadium and viewers at home. These Al use cases would then help build the tourism industry post . Through it TASMUI6 program, the MoTC has already proposed several use cases to transform Qatar into a digitally smart' nation. Many of these use cases already have a strong datadriven focus Using Al Qatar can become a role model for sustainable urban development by cutting emissions in energy production and manufacturing from its current globally highest per capita levels Food Security Food Security has been identified as a national priority by Qatar There is a tremendous potential for applying Al technology at the foodenergywater nexus and many countries, mostly notably the Netherlands, have taken the lead in promoting next generation precision agriculture and vertical farming techniques. There is a to generate massive amounts of data at the finest granularity level in agriculture and create customized water and fertilizer usage plans which increases crop yield and is environment friendly at the same time. Al will play a big role in achieving food security in Qatar and everywhere in the future when severe strain on yields and arable land is expected due to climate change. Furthermore Qatar should develop customized Aldriven simulations to prepare contingency plans to maintain food supply pipelines in face of regional disruptions and threats. Oil and Gas Qatar's mature oil and gas industry stands to benefit significantly from AI. Qatarbased companies have access to the most finegrained logging data from gas operations which can be leveraged to create niche Alproducts in the oil and gas sector For example the use of this data to develop solutions for predictive maintenance enabled could help realize tremendous efficiency gains and reduce production downtimes. Al will also enable data driven revenue management and logistics optimization RECOMMENDATIONS Build applications using Arabic language processing for business use cases to become the leader in this domain among the Arab nations Leverage Al expertise available within the country in strategically important domains for Qatar like oil and gas, transportation health, and cybersecurity to build competitive advantage in specific use cases that could also generate export revenues in the future Use FIFA  to collect data and pilot Al application ideas that could also benefit Qatar in the run  put push long  National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Qatar Pillar  Ethics and public policy The increasing pervasiveness of Al in our personal lives and work poses many ethical and public policy questions Al methods tend to acquire black box' characteristics and sometimes are not amenable to fairness, accountability and transparency principles that are vital for the longterm viability of societies and countries. Al algorithms will inherit any biases' consecrated in data and mechanisms are required that guarantee outputs which are consistent with societal norms. Transparency and accountability require Al models to be explainable, i.e,, the output of an Al algorithm be describable in plain natural language Explainability and Interpretability in Al is emerging as an important Al research topic in its own right For example consider an Al algorithm that decides how patients should be prioritized to receive scarce organ transplants. If a pure data solution is used then an algorithm may inadvertently use longevity as a criterion and rank the patients based primarily on age. Modern Al relies on data including personally identifiable information PII. For many technological companies the user is a product and advertisers are the customers who pay a fee to access user information There is an increasing worldwide to treat private information as a human right and Qatar should use the recently introduced General Data Protection Regulation GDPR by the European Union as a template to introduce guidelines that protect its citizens from online exploitationI8. Qatar's Ministry of Transportation and Communication MoTC and previously ictQatar which is now part of MoTC had issued guidelines for Qatar on privacy and data sharing that are in alignment with Qatar's traditions and ambitions These would form an excellent starting to develop a larger and comprehensive set of guidelines for the country RECOMMENDATIONS The Qatari government should introduce guidelines for the level of explainability and interpretability required for different types of decisions made by Al algorithms Build up from the existing guidelines on privacy, data sharing, etc. developed by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications MoTC and previously ICT Qatar Qatar should develop an Al Ethics and Governance framework for addressing ethical and public policy questions, which will become increasingly important as the use of Al expands into sensitive areas of society such as policing, courts, health, and warfare The framework to be developed must be consistent with both Qatari social, cultural, and religious norms and international guidelines while ensuring that Qatar emerges as a leading proponent of AI.  push point  CONCLUSION The proposed strategy provides specific recommendations for the leadership of Qatar to set course, embark and flourish in the brave new world of Artificial Intelligence. Globally, the consensus has been building that the advent of Artificial Intelligence AI is the next technological inflection point at par with the industrial revolution, the benefits and consequences of which we are still witnessing Those who can develop mastery in using and developing Al applications will reap its benefits and thrive. Qatar is well positioned to take advantage of this golden opportunity and become a critical player in the Al economy of the future. However we need to act with a sense of urgency to realize this opportunity before it becomes too late as the Al race among countries is becoming very competitive. Qatar needs to act on the recommendations listed under the six pillars of the proposed national AI strategy to ensure it builds sustainable competitive advantages and remains a critical player in the global economy and society This would require significant investments in the education and retraining of its citizenry to augment their existing capabilities with Al technologies and build an ecosystem conducive to developing path breaking Al technologies in Qatar HBKU Research Complex   National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Qatar NOTES .
