Foreword Through its continued efforts toward the early realization of the Digital Pakistan vision of the Government of Pakistan, the Ministry of IT & Telecom is committed to providing its people with timely and equal access to opportunities by stimulating culture of innovation through an overarching developmental agenda orchestrated to embrace cutting-edge   technologies such as Artificial   Intelligence   efficiently and responsibly: In this regard, the Artificial Intelligence (Al) Policy is a pivotal milestone for transforming Pakistan into a knowledge-based economy as it spells out national strategy to establish an ecosystem necessary for Al adoption by harnessing an agile framework for addressing different aspects of unique user journeys encompassing different market horizontals and industry verticals by ensuring responsible use of AI. Furthermore, the policy aims to go beyond the meagre approach of adopting technology to fundamentally rethink Al adoption in the local context so that new growth areas can be identified and intervened in considering the existing job market's relevance while empathizing with the growing population of the country: This policy stems from the ""Al for good"" initiative by the International Telecommunication Union and the Sustainable Development Goals set forth by the United Nations. Considering the disruptive nature of Al and allied technologies and how it is re-ordering the socio- economic construct of the world, we desire to live in. Therefore, it is essential to responsibly harness this opportunity while keeping the interest of a common person foremost: Therefore, to survive and thrive, Pakistan aims to revitalize its resolve toward digitalization, which will involve processing personal data through Al. To this end,the said policy coherently interlaces with the Personal Data Protection Act, Pakistan Cloud First Policy, and the Digital Pakistan Policy initiatives. 5

Executive Summary Pakistan has a unique opportunity to harness digital disruption by educating an eager young population that can potentially   propel the nation onto growth trajectory to sustain our future national competitiveness and improve the lives of citizens. Artificial Intelligence (Al) represents the next frontier of technological opportunities, and it has been widely proven and understood that the collection, processing, use, and exchange of data through automated/intelligent means would drive the entire society into the next stage of its evolution which is unprecedented and requires a progressive, yet careful approach: So, after a thorough analysis of the global perspective and based on the evidence collected through more extensive consultations with the stakeholders, the Ministry of IT & Telecom has come to much-desired conclusion that it needs to chalk out a developmental roadmap for better, faster and responsible adoption of Alin the country: For that, the policy document is put in place to reap long-term and sustainable benefits for its people. The policy document offers wide range of developmental initiatives necessary for awareness and adoption, reimagining the transparent and fair use of personal data using Al and stimulating innovation through industry-academia collaborations and investments in Al-led initiatives. The National Al Policy is crafted to focus on the equitable distribution of opportunity and its responsible use, having the following defining attributes. Evidence-Based and Target Oriented User-Centric and Forward-Looking Objective and Overarching The Al policy further aims to augment Al and allied technologies through balanced demand and supply- side interventions, as briefly described below: Market Enablement Establishment of research & innovation centers in Al for developing, test- bedding, deploying, and scaling Al solutions. This includes learning how to improve governance and manage the impact of Al: Progressive and Trusted Environment Responsible use of Al to generate economic gains and improve lives. In addition, Al will raise the Government's capability to deliver anticipatory and personalized services Enabling AI through Awareness and Readiness Pakistan shall increase awareness and understanding of Al technologies and their benefits; our workforce will be equipped with the necessary competencies to participate in the Al economy_ Transformation & Evolution Transformation of sectors and industries towards effective use of Al, facilitated by national IT boards through creating awareness and offering training programs through sectoral cooperation.

2 Introduction and Context 2.1 Why Pakistan Needs AI Policy The need for National Al Policy is to create a broad-based awareness ofthe use f Al-based platforms while keeping privacy at the forefront; upskilling human capital on Al and allied technologies, guiding investment in Al research and development, ensuring ethical and responsible use of Al, and provide a framework for addressing the challenges and risks associated with the socio-economic outfit of the country: The Al policy covers the following areas, including: Investment in Research and Development Infrastructure: Pakistan should invest in research and development to build in-house Al capabilities required for application development based on local data. This investment should include funding for establishing research organizations that have a sustainable mandate of basic research, data standardization, providing support to the government for   regulatory and  legal interventions   regarding Al; maintaining central   computational infrastructure, data storage facilities, and partnerships with universities and research institutions both domestically and internationally: This investment should also include training programs to build the necessary technical expertise: The Al policy outlines how Pakistan must collaborate with other countries to share best practices and expertise in Al: Ethical and Responsible Use: The Al policy proposed the establishment of an Al regulatory directorate that ensures the ethical and responsible use of Al. This includes ensuring that Al is not used to discriminate against individuals or groups and that its use is transparent and accountable. Job Displacement: The Al policy addresses the potential job displacement that could result from the global proliferation of Al: This includes investing in training programs to help existing and new workforce acquire the skills to adapt to changing job requirements. Al can help to promote economic growth by encouraging investment in Al research and development: This investment can lead to the creation of new jobs and industries, as well as improved productivity and efficiency: Al policy can help address social and economic challenges by improving healthcare outcomes, providing better access to education, and addressing food security challenges. Al policy can help ensure that Al's benefits are shared equitably across society. This includes addressing issues such as bias and discrimination and ensuring that the benefits of Al are not concentrated in the hands of a few. 2.2 The State of Al in Pakistan Pakistan has a population of 224 million as of 2022 and is predicted to reach 338 million by 2050 [2], with current literacy rate of around 62.3% [3]. Moreover, Pakistan is considered the fifth largest country in the world in terms of the young population; 64% of the nation is younger than 30 [4]. With such a propelling number of employable human capital, we have enormous development potential on one end and tremendous responsibility on the other. Nevertheless, despite all the odds, Pakistan has been able to register notable efforts through public/private interventions as follows: Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence & Computing (PIAIC) Center for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (CENTAIC) National Center of Artificial Intelligence (NCAI) Sino-Pak Center for Artificial Intelligence (SPCAI) These timely initiatives have performed well in their domains and need continuity to achieve long-term targets. To achieve the Al-accelerated socio-economic development urgently required by Pakistan and its actual impact on the GDP ofthe country, a national strategy for Aladoption is critical: The Al policy provides holistic structure, by the societal challenges regarding Al adoption can be addressed by establishing the necessary ecosystem with specialized initiatives and organizational responsibilities. The policy proposes the National Al fund as a perpetual and central fund to support the proposed interventions. key

On the contrary, the sectorial approach is swift but in siloes, and therefore, desired performance targets are challenging: The Government of Pakistan is aware of data orchestration and management issues in the social sector. Due to these   challenges, National developmental drive via focused national projects is necessitated through this initiative by directly investing in a handful of priority areas for improving service delivery: Following are the National Al Initiatives that shall be undertaken to bring Al applications into the mainstream to achieve socio-economic deliverables and ensure sustainable outcomes: 4.1.3.1 Data Standardization and Aggregation for Servicification The National and Provincial governments possess heterogeneous datasets through various verifiable and unverifiable sources and require orchestration bottom-up for secure and transparent use: Suppose the social data is standardized and made available by the private sector for public service provisioning in structured environment: In that case, it can help reduce time to service due to process cluttering and ensure seamless application of Al and allied technologies in an integrated manner. Immediate actions required in this regard are= The CoE-Al shall organize a common and sectoral data collection and processing mechanism for unstructured, semi-structured, and structured datasets for the data available in the public sector and accessible through market regulators for the private sector: Il, CoE-Al shall undertake the data standardization in the identified priority social sectors under a Common Operating Environment (COE) such as Healthcare, Legal, Public Facilitation Services, Education, Food Security, and essential Utilities (electricity, gas, drinking water, water, sewage, and cleaning services): Il: These standards shall be implemented via National/Provincial IT Boards across the country by standardizing data collection and processing under different Management Information Systems operating in various departments/institutions. Furthermore, the available data  should be available to these National/Provincial IT Boards to develop a standard data exchange system: IV_ In another scenario, where there is yet to be digitized for seamless collection, especially in the identified social sectors, the National/Provincial IT Boards in support of CoE-Al, while exercising their mandate, shall assist such National/Provincial institutions in digitizing data on the given standards for early alignment: V_ Under the Cloud First Policy of the Government of Pakistan, although the end-user department shall remain the custodian of acquired data, a copy of such data public data must be hosted on the National Telecom Corporation (NTC) cloud infrastructure nationwide. Moreover, 3

Page 19:

National/Provincial IT Boards shall act as controllers and processors of such data while assisting the concerned department(s) in secure and effective service provisioning: VI.

leverage new revenue streams and market growth. In addition, Al can supplement the IT industry by making its systems more efficient, courtesy of predictive analytics and Big Data Analytics According to statistics, 48% of businesses use Machine Learning, data analytics, and other Al tools IT exports are rapidly growing in Pakistan and have significant potential. Equipping local IT companies with Al infrastructure and skilled human capital can help them leverage new and diverse opportunities in the global marketspace. 6_ Financial Sector: Al can improve customer experience in the financial sector with enhanced investment opportunity identification. Chatbots provide smooth and excellent customer service experience to clients Moreover, Al-based technologies and algorithms curb and mitigate fraudulent financial activities and augment data safety. Al can improve tax compliance and administration by improving efficiency through automation and Al-based algorithms 7_ Academia: Al can assist in teaching and skills development methods. At the global level, Al adoption leaders have ensured that Al-based curricula become integral to educational institutions to prepare future generations Academia and the industry need to collaborate and cooperate, especially in R&D and HR-related initiatives that can assist in the proliferation of Al-based technologies and inculcate innovative and entrepreneurial thinking in our youth while nurturing a culture that will expedite Al adoption in various sectors and industries in Pakistan: 8 Government Sector: Public and government services can benefit from Al-based technologies and become more efficient and productive. For example, automation and chatbots improve the efficiency and quality of services provided to the public. Similarly, Al can help make complex economic decisions to enhance the productivity of various sectors and industries through accurate predictions 9 Defense Sector: The defense sector of any country showcases the strength of the country'$ sovereignty and its ability to defend itself against aggressors. Therefore, every government spends a substantial part of its GDP to enhance its defense capabilities and tries to inculcate the latest technologies to strengthen its prowess Al has brought revolutionary improvements in various defense sub-sectors, particularly in intelligent surveillance systems, automatic drones, geographic target detection, autonomous path tracking in missiles, autofocus in tanks and guns, target detection and recognition, and enhanced night vision. Unfortunately, Pakistan has faced the worst kind of terrorism for many years. It has caused us irreversible damage with the loss of precious lives of innocent civilians and our armed forces personnel, structural damages, and loss of investors. Al and allied technologies can provide invaluable services in effectively combating terrorism and achieving defense targets. 8.2 Survey Statistics To assess the state of Al in Pakistan, the Ministry of IT & Telecom organized a sectorial survey to register the evidence nationwide.

8.3 Market Challenges The evidence furnished above simplifies the identification of challenges leading to pragmatic market support and only necessary interventions. These challenges are: 3.2.1. G1 Awareness and Adaptation Challenges It is becoming increasingly important that society is aware of the potential of Al in solving routine matters This requires an awareness campaign towards controlling and sharing data, basic skills education, and high-impact skilling at all levels of the community for sustainable growth: Nations dominating the Al and allied technologies arena have instituted well-defined Human Capital development and evolution mechanisms to prepare the future generation for Al adoption in various sectors through  sizable public/private investments and to retain the talent locally: Moreover, international universities have inculcated Al-based curricula in their primary, high- school, undergraduate, and post-graduate programs to ensure that Al is adopted in a structured manner offering comprehensive development plan for its role in different phases of life and work In Pakistan, enabling Al and allied technologies is challenging without having basic level of awareness about the technology at the user level. It should be complemented with skilled human resources, having a broader understanding of how and where Al should be applied and the best practices in this technology for its effective and responsible use. The major hurdle in preparing Al- trained human capital is the access to data needed to train them in various domains of Al-based technologies. Hence, data is the underlying artefact for putting skilled human capital to work and making them experiment with using Al-based models in a controlled yet agile environment: IM. Al adoption would disrupt how work will be done in public and private sectors and various industries, directly affecting the country's socio-economic fabric; People working in traditional ways and not skilled in Al-based technologies are at risk of losing their jobs if not pivoted timely: This issue must be addressed on priority basis, which can only be done through awareness and upskilling: Customized learning programs, workshops, and courses can assist such individuals in surviving this transition and becoming an integral part of digitally transformed workplaces. IV. According to the surveys, at a sectoral scale, half of the respondents are well versed with Al and related technologies, while the other half possess working knowledge. To teach an Al-based curriculum, the survey findings point to including short courses and 6-12 month-long boot camps/diplomas urgently. Furthermore, bachelor's/master's level programs and Ph.D. degrees in Al are also worth considering: The significant adaptation challenges towards Al proliferation include digitization of information, digital access, literacy, and digital inclusion by design: Heaps of data are available in the public and private sectors, either difficult to access or not available appropriately (such as in hard copies): In many cases, it has been observed that data digitalization and basic process automation in confined environment are considered sufficient due to a lack of awareness_ Alternatively, Cloud- based solutions using Al for data/process orchestration, management, and analytics offered as SaaS provides greater access. However, with limited knowledge, such services are never done justice in terms of their utilization. Moreover, in several cases, local SMEs and enterprises are not using Al and allied technologies effectively, leading to demand-side paralysis. For instance, digitizing healthcare-related data is essential in getting patients' history accessible to the doctors as well as various diagnostic and R&D. Unfortunately, the healthcare sector is digitized at fundamental level with limited or zero technological transformation and the standardization of data, which is a significant hurdle in enabling Al-based advancement in the healthcare sector. VI. Digital literacy is another challenge as people are to be educated about data digitization and accessibility and how to adopt safe data-sharing mechanisms. Moreover, it needs to be organized 23

Page 39:

to allow equal opportunity for children, women from remote areas, and disabled persons to benefit from the Al proliferation efforts and meet future challenges 3.2.2. G2 Data Standardization and Accessibility Globally, leaders in Al proliferation have made data standardization and accessibility their top priority. For example, China used the vast datasets available from the provinces to train Al and allied technologies, especially in the healthcare sector. As a result; it took the burden from the hospitals and medical practitioners. Estonia is another shining example of data standardization and accessibility that enabled the small European country to lead in Al adoption. Organizations obtain data from several resources Ifthis data from disparate sources is not brought to common operating environment, it will create significant problems in its processing for different purposes and uses Therefore, Pakistan'$ primary issue is to digitize and organize the massive datasets available in various inaccessible forms and make them available in a standardized form to make them more relevant for data analytics and other data processing mechanisms. This is only achievable through sustainable developmental hubs and associated collaborations in different sectors. I. Data standardization has been done in the financial sector according to international standards to retain a competitive edge: Most companies in the IT industry have also ensured standardization and accessibility: However, as learned through the survey, other sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, retail & commerce, and healthcare lag significantly in this domain. Significant efforts are required to develop andaugment an ecosystem that catalyzes the countrys adoption of Aland allied technologies Moreover, the lack of accessibility to data hinders Al-based R&D, predictive analytics, and various other Al-based technologies from producing valuable outputs. It adversely affects advancement in research & development and Al proliferation: The survey results report: a. The lack of accessibility of data has been pointed out by 86% of the stakeholders, which is a prerequisite to Al adoption in any sector. b 50% of the stakeholders shared their concerns about data not being standardized: C. 71% of respondents consider poor data collection practices a crippling factor for successful Al adoption. d 449 of the stakeholders recommend following leaders in Al adoption, such as the UK, Estonia, and China, for data standardization mechanisms: 3.2.3. G3 Computational Infrastructure Situation and Needs Developed countries and the countries which have made significant progress in Al proliferation have ensured the availability of computational equipment and facilities to the stakeholders and institutions to train the human capital and streamline the modernization of processes to ensemble sustainable Al outfit: However, such efforts need resources these countries have ensured and made available to the relevant stakeholders_ Il. Limited computational resources are a shared obstacle by various sectors of Pakistan: The need for computational facilities is emphasized for providing robust and secure access to infrastructure for complex R&D and high-performing systems. Furthermore, these computational facilities are essential for any initiative to train human resources in Al and allied technologies. Their availability under one roof is necessary to streamline the training and learning process. Il. Similarly, in many cases, the computational resources are not used optimally. Therefore, national/provincial data repository of all the public sector data can be made available to a broader audience via secure/controlled channel: There is also strong need for training on high- performance computing technologies so that indigenous customized solutions can meet local computational requirements within the country: 24

Page 40:

IV. 57% of stakeholders have registered concerns regarding the limited availability of computational resources as a barrier to achieving a trained workforce in Al and allied technologies. To augment applied research and provide robust and secure access to infrastructure for complex R&D, computational facilities are considered vital by 55% of stakeholders. 3.2.4. G4 Ethical Challenges Safe and secure data sharing and ethical adoption of Al and allied technologies are primary concerns for every stakeholder, national or international: At global level, various countries that have adopted Al formulated guidelines and principles for the ethical use of Al and related technologies and established regulatory framework to streamline safe and secure data-sharing mechanisms. Regulatory challenges must be addressed to establish an environment of trust_ Moreover, it is the users' fundamental right that their data be safe and that their privacy is always upheld. Therefore, an effective regulatory system that may steer Al adoption, related initiatives, and data-sharing mechanisms is needed: Most stakeholders voted various risks associated with Al adoption medium to high, including malicious intent; data pollution, Data model theft, fairness, precision deterioration, invasion of privacy, etc_ 25

2.0 INTERNATIONAL LANDSCAPE IN DATA & Al Since the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence in 1956, where the term Al was coined by Professor John McCarty, Data & Al have mainly been fields of specialists in academic institutions, government, and private research organizations: However; the recent years have been characterized by a shift of interest towards the public sphere to include political actors, the general public, and private companies in nearly all sectors:

Page 9:

2.0 Two main trends have contributed to this shift: First, the extensive use of digital applications by the general public, such as natural language processing; has generated a significant amount of data essential to Al development: The other factor has been the fast developments in computing capabilities; enabling the processing of increasingly large amounts of data: This development happened in parallel with significant advances in machine learning; a branch of Al. Data & Al are already disrupting several sectors and will become a factor in economic development: While @ tremendous amount of opportunities are provided by Al solutions (disaster management, road safety; or energy consumption management); some challenges are emerging (data protection; automation; cybersecurity): In order for societies to benefit from the opportunities provided by Data & Al and to address the challenges and threats they generate, governments have been framing their approach to support and regulate Data & Al. There are currently around 50 governments that have developed or are developing a national Al strategy in the past two to three years: One of the central issues where government action is expected will be around data sharing and open data strategies: Countries have adopted different approaches to collect, generate, and process data: Countries also took strides in making public data available, ranging from limited data releases to open data by default: Having large amounts of data available to public, private, academic, and research actors would provide economic benefits; increased citizens engagement; attractive environment for investors and accelerating innovation: For example, having access to data from municipalities can support local government in designing policies and public services taking into account the specific needs of populations: key key

National Strategy for Data & AI 19 key key

Page 20:

4.1 As a result, this strategy would concentrate on the first phase This first phase is about maximizing the use cases of Data & Al to achieve the objectives set under Vision 2030 and accompany the transition and focus on key domains and niche topics to serve on the international scene. This includes Supporting data and skills within both government and the private sector to prepare for @ growing labor market demand Enhancing the regulatory environment to enable the development of a performing domestic ecosystem Creating sector-specific Data & Al plans Driving adoption of data management standards and policies across governement entities to collect data in readable and usable formats Creating dynamic domestic and healthy Data & Al start-up ecosystem: This would require government support such as the establishment of a favorable regulatory environment; credit facilities and trainings Building highly qualified national talents to respond to the needs of the market Attracting sustained private and international investment into the Saudi market Elevating Data & Al RSI capabilities, quality and commercialization outcomes and establishing test-beds in new and smart cities Building on the first phase would allow for setting the foundations for a new strategy after 2030 to establish a Data & Al industry to compete on the global scene:

Page 21:

4. Our vision is translated into six strategic objectives: OBJECTIVE 1 Position KSA as the global hub where the best of Data € Al is made reality KSA's vision as an international/regional hub for Data & Al activities requires solid presence on the global landscape of Data & Al through publicly available contributions Therefore, we are developing a comprehensive plan for KSAs contributions in global/local Data & Al global initiatives and events In fact; we are planning to host the first Global Al summit in KSA The Summit will be a unique annual platform for global thought leaders, decision-makers and innovators to showcase, debate and shape the future agenda of Al for governments, private sector and NOOs, to amplify Al's positive value for humanity: OBJECTIVE 2 Transform KSA's workforce with a steady local supply of Data & Al empowered talents Data & Al are transforming labor markets globally: Most sectors will have to adapt in order to maximize the benefits this transformation is bringing: The faster we are in integrating Data & Al into our education system, professional trainings and into general public knowledge, the greater advantage we will gain in terms of employment; productivity and innovation: As for most countries undergoing the Data & Al transition, the Kingdom, with its ambitious plan to develop its Data & Al sector; will face a skills shortage. Most governments and private sector companies globally are competing to attract data scientists, data architects, coders and many of the professions needed to build Data & Al capabilities. The same actors are making efforts to attract talent from overseas but they also invest in the development of their own workforce: While this strategy aims at attracting foreign talent; it is crucial for the country to sustainably develop local talent and to provide the necessary incentives fof them to stay in Saudi Arabia: Developing local talent requires to concentrater on three categories of the workforce Natiohal Strategy for Data & AI 21 key

Page 22:

4.1 Data Al experts specialists committed to innovation activities Data & Al specialists graduates from the field and who can potentially support its development General workforce labor force not necessarily working on Data Al topics but whose literacy in the field needs to be strengthened For the three categories, there should be an adapted effort in order to build the local workforce. Within the framework of this strategy, we aim at creating educational tracks in Data & Al in K-12 and university degrees, some of which leading to specialist tracks supported by educational scholarships and professional training: We are also strengthening our cooperation with academic institutions while developing a certification program to recognize the efforts of professionals interested in developing Data & AI skills OBJECTIVE 3 Enact the most welcoming legislation for Data & Al businesses and talents Our goal is to develop welcoming; flexible, and stable regulatory frameworks and incentives schemes to attract companies, investors and talents. Regulations will also focus on developing adaptive policy frameworks and standards on Data & Al including the ethical use of Al. These policies will provide direction to stakeholders and certainty over Data & Al activities. As part of providing an attractive regulatory framework for Data & Al investments and businesses, we aim at having strong framework to promote and support ethical development of Data & Al research and solutions This framework will provide guidelines for the development of our data protection and privacy standards. This is beneficial to both society as well as businesses and investors who need a stable regulatory framework to operate in the Kingdom: National Strategy for Data & AI 22 key

Page 23:

4. In addition, the creation of and access to open data is a crucial asset which any strong Data & Al ecosystem will need. Opening government data provides significant opportunities to public and private sector organizations as well as individuals It would contribute to creating an attractive environment for startups, provide visibility on policy formation; decision-making and drive economic growth and innovation Therefore, our ambition is to roll-out open data by default the implication being that all government data should be published as long as it does not compromise security, data protection, and privacy: However; this initiative requires a strong regulatory framework to provide high standards in terms of data protection and privacy, in line with our ethical approach to developing our data sector: Doing this would define the framework through which government and private organizations will be able to benefit from the opportunities provided by data: The regulatory framework will include specifications on data collection, classification, sharing, open data policy and freedom of information: In order to achieve this, we will collaborate across government to ensure data is captured in readable formats, then start publishing the most timely and comprehensive datasets, to ultimately roll-out open data by default across government entities after 2025. This illustrates our effort to facilitate access to public data for organizations contributing to the development of the sector This process starts with data collection where a standardized format will be required to capture data, followed by the publication of initial datasets from selected government organizations (ministries, agencies, or other), to test adoption from interested organizations This two-step initial phase would take place over the 2020-2025 period before transitioning to scaling our open data by default program across the whole-of-government from 2025 onwards National Strategy Rata1AX

Therefore, we will build an incentive package aimed at attracting foreign companies and facilitating the creation of local businesses in the Data & Al sector: This would encourage foreign firms to invest in the Kingdom and facilitate knowledge transfer to empower local firms:

Page 25:

4.1 OBJECTIVE 4 Attract efficient, stable funding for qualified Data & Al investment opportunities Our goal is to incentivize and enable local and foreign investors to effectively identify and fund available Data & Al investment opportunities in KSA We will build targeted funds and investor support programs to attract and guide domestic and foreign investments in Data & Al: The Data & Al sector in KSA will need large amounts of investments to grow: These investments can be encouraged by a fund that adds incentives by reducing the risk of subsidizing returns Therefore, we will setup a fund/financial mechanism incentivizing Foreign Direct Investment local investments in Data & Al priority areas_ We will invest in relevant cutting-edge Data & Al applications to the KSA market and new promising technologies to first-mover advantage. We will also setup an investors' support program providing professional services such as investment screening and business plan development: The ace of technological innovation in the Data & Al sector generates a continuous need to adapt Our support would provide guidance to both foreign and domestic investors on the Saudi ecosystem in terms of domestic financial facilities, the regulatory framework as well as the business ecosystem (high potential startups, projects, and planned initiatives): National Strategy fok Data AI 25 gain key

4. OBJECTIVE 6 Stimulate Data & Al adoption with the most collaborative, and forward-thinking ecosystem One of the key success factors for Data & Al strategies will be attributed to the adoption of innovative solutions enabled by Data & Al, across the public and private sectors, as well as individuals Developing a robust digital infrastructure that developers could utilize would be of utmost importance. In addition, public awareness of ongoing activities will be key to ensuring citizen understanding of the benefits generated by the fast emergence of a high number of Data & Al practical applications We will also develop sector-specific Data & Al plans. These sectors will be identified based on the current digital maturity of each sector; alignment with Vision 2030 objectives and Data & Al expected impact: In fact; while all sectors will be disrupted to a certain extent, some sectors will expect major shifts due to Data & Al: In order to promote nation-wide Al adoption and utilization, it is crucial to provide the opportunity for individuals and small businesses to access well-established and sophisticated Data & Al platforms. We will develop sector-focused partnerships in the domain of Data & Al platforms and provide accessible Data & Al platforms at country level through partnerships with major companies with efficient and sophisticated platforms. Promoting close cooperation within the ecosystem to include all key stakeholders such as the government; businesses, academic institutions, financial actors and the general public to develop linkages which are essential to achieve scale.

With current events of Covid19 and other related factors, Malaysia GDP is not quite even at 4.0% and this framework (McKinsey) enables the Al-Rmap to evaluate and to calculate what is the expected GDP growth: In view of this, Al-Rmap is targeting towards at least an Al-led growth that aims for 30% increase in the GDP growth at the very least: Due to the importance of Al for Malaysia, Al-Rmap proposes that an annual economic impact assessment should be carried out over during the RMK12 period: This will not only help Malaysian validate existing reports, but also becomes a measure of progress in the implementation of the National Al Roadmap. figure.

SCAN here STRATEGY 3: ESCALATING DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENABLE Al There is a complex infrastructure and technologies needed to sustain Al initiatives, including the need for a vast amount of computing capacity and the ability to transmit large volumes of data. Organisations not only need the ability to access the large volume of data generated by loT/SG devices, but they also need infrastructure capable of achieving value through computation and data processing: Digital infrastructure refers to the systems which connect people to digital information, products, and services. It serves as the backbone of the digital economy and includes both hard (physical) and soft (non-physical) digital infrastructure comprising connectivity; devices, data storage and processing; services, and applications. Similar to the way cables, wires, and generators provide for the electricity needs of citizens, digital infrastructure enables transmission of information and data, underpinning our social and economic lives: Digital infrastructure once required large up-front investment in equipment such as fiber optics, satellites, and high-powered computing facilities, highly flexible and elastic on-demand cloud computing services. At present, there is shift from capital expenditure to operational expenditure, lowering the barrier to entry for individuals, businesses, and governments. Strategy 3 emphasizes the digital infrastructure that needs to be enabled to support the Al implementation: The nationwide Al-Rmap survey indicates that only 30% of the responding organizations are at the initial implementation of the digital infrastructure and data activities. Malaysian organisations need to take closer look at the technological requirements to execute the Al implementation and ensure that their infrastructure capabilities meet the technologv's demands. Therefore, three initiatives are formulated in ensuring that the organisations can continuously deploy Al in their activities: Strategic Initiative 1: Enabling adoption of cloud computing and storage for AI Strategic Initiative 2: Enabling data sharing in Al Catalyst Consortium Strategic Initiative 3: Improving network & connectivity for wider access to digital infrastructure for Al

Since engineering and data science are solutions in organizations in a the foundation of Al, these talents possess the basics for Al and are suitable for further wav that conforms upskilling and specialization in the area of Al The nationwide Al-Rmap 2021 survey shows that the Responsible Al Principles_ Al Talents in Malaysia are mainly sourced by upskilling current employees, industry-university 0 partnership; and advertisements. The evolving list of skills expected in Al Talents include: Al Data Science skills understands and able to contribute to the end-to-end data science process, which include data preparation, feature  engineering; develop models, and 77,492 evaluation of these models. Note that Data Scientists and Al Data Experts are roles that involve   experience   developed over time, rather than recruited  fresh from graduation: However, fresh graduates from computer science or STEM programs are natural candidates for Al training: TYPES OF Al Al Engineering skills ability to create technologv architectures that scale, writing and deploying bulletproof software incorporating Al features, and integrating Al capabilities with TALENTS existing systems.

428 This strategy must be achieved through talent-by-design not by chance: The core competency of the 21st century is the ability to learn, and this must be embedded, nurtured, reinforced and incentivized throughout the talent development value chain Need to invest in building the workforce of the future, by strengthening and expanding the science, technologv; engineering and mathematics (STEM) talent pool Prioritise high level STEM specialisation in cutting edge, disruptive technology ahead of time taking the cue from foresight intelligence 0 Sharpen talent pool competencies in the 4Cs: critical thinking, creativity, collaboration and communication Create opportunities and resources for talent in cutting edge technology areas to collaborate with the brightest and best globally 37,4921 Fostering Al Talents strategy comprises three-pronged approach, targeting three different segments (Table 44). Strategic Initiative 4.1 develops Al talents through offering comprehensive and inclusive Al Education, from school level to tertiary level: Strategic Initiative 4.2 targets on 719,5d reskilling and upskilling employees in the workforce: Strategic Initiative 4.3 aims to attract Al talents in the Al diaspora contribute to Malaysia'$ Al industry: They can either return to develop Malaysia' s Al industry as Al champions, or to collaborate with Malaysian industries even if they choose not to return__ The latent Al talents are those with Al related qualifications skills but have retired or left the workforce for personal reasons.

Strategic Initiative 4.1   Offering Comprehensive and Inclusive Al Education Talent development is core in building the workforce of the future. Education is the best way to prepare future talents with knowledge in Al. The ability to identify how Al can be utilized in various   situations must be nurtured and reinforced throughout the education process. education must be comprehensive, where Al is introduced at all levels, beginning from the school level, up to tertiary level. Our children are growing up with various instances of Al driven devices and services_ An intensive Al for Kids and program introduces school children to basic principles of how Al operates and what Al is capable of. Hence, this program will shape these children's mental models of what Al is and how it manifests, that they will not overestimate capabilities of Al.

Al-EE should also be extended to MOHR registered trainers_ At the industry, Al professionals  in the workforce are encouraged pursue  professional doctorate and professional master's program to enable them to solve industry problems using the latest Al  knowledge and   skills. Employers are also  encouraged sponsor their professionals for postgraduate education by participating in Al-Mylndustry matching grants offered by agencies such as MDEC Apart from the formal education, universities could also offer MOOC-based certification program on Al: 53 Teens and

Strategic Initiative 4.2 Reskilling and Upskilling Existing Workforce The future of work will revolve around Al either the form of Al used to strengthen analytics Al empowering cognitive automation, or Al used to offer individualized services and products. Avoiding Al from disrupting existing jobs or displacing existing workers would require workers of today to be reskilled upskilled Al Talents 5O that they are equipped with necessary and relevant Al skills. However, Al reskilling activities needs to be strategic, and must also include upskilling activities for existing workers already equipped with Al skills __ To consolidate all Al related reskilling and upskilling activities, dedicated Al Reskilling and Upskilling System (Al-RUS) online platform needs to be developed (Table 46). As a start, Al- RUS will be focusing to reskill workers sectors with the highest  probability of Al disruption, before expanding to reskill workers from all sectors. In order to carry out this, Al-RUS will be equipped with  relevant  modules including asynchronous  reskilling and upskilling module (for non-Al, mid-career workforce to be Al-Talents), job matching module (for reskilled Al-Talents), and mentoring module (for continuous upskilling of Al-Talents): Al= RUS will also be expanded to offer Al Skills and Competency awards and competitions that is envisioned to continuously test the abilities of Al Talents in Malaysia. Apart from existing workforce, Al-RUS will also be equipped with Executive Al Upskilling module to upskill SME management Al skills to strategically achieve competitive All users of Al- RUS who has received reskilling (and upskilling) will be integrated into the National Al Directory (Al-DI) and their skill progression will be recorded: Apart from having an online consolidated platform, Al reskilling activities must also engage the technicians and skilled labour population who might not have access to Al-RUS: For this,_ dedicated hybrid on-site activity powered by asynchronous training module from Al-RUS to train technicians and skilled labour will be place _ Trainers for this particular program will be those who are registered with MOHR (HRDF) which have credentials from AI-EE: Apart from this extended Al-RUS program, these trainers should also strengthen their offerings with additional and Al-RUS-complementing adult-learning; mid-career Al reskilling and upskilling programs__ The use of AR/VR part of the blended learning experience is highly encouraged. At the other end, apart from being part of Al-RUS, employers are also recommended to integrate reskilling and upskilling activities part of annual appraisals and design On-Job-Training (OJT) that further supports reskilling of mid-career workers. 55 and top goals. put

Strategic Initiative 4.3  Attracting Retaining Al Talents This strategic initiative aims to further boost the number of Al Talents in Malaysia by attracting latent Al Talents back to work and creating new Al Talents from the pool of unemployed workers_ Furthermore; specific program must be put in place pull back female Al Talents in Malaysia who do not serve the Al workforce_ Therefore, the Al-Latent-Workforce-Back-to-Work (Al-LWBW) program, which designed to be run concurrently with the Women-in-Al program, aims to empower and attract latent Al Talents especially female Al Talents by providing scaffolding sub- programs such Childcare for  Women-in-Al; and Al-Work-From-Home, sub- program that would   allow Talents to be location independent   and   their productivity  will be monitored via Productivity and Goal-based Performance 8 Measurement System. 701 I 85 Apart from the private sector, the Public Service Department (JPA) should also be engaged to encourage Ageing-Al-Talents in the public sector to continue contributing even after retirement; as part of a knowledge management program and to address the dearth of Al talents in the Public Sector. This would be able to ensure continuity of Al implementation in the public sector. Malaysia must also look outwards and must attract world renowned expert Talents overseas in the Al talent diaspora to set up base in Malaysia and become Al Talent Champions: For this to be materialized, an Al Talent Visa under the Al Talent Champion Empowerment (Al-ChEmp) Program is proposed: The search for these Al Talent Champions must first prioritize Malaysian expert Al Talents who are globally sought-after but choose to remain Malaysia, and to the Malaysian expert Al- Talents  diaspora currently residing overseas At the very least, these Malaysian expert Al-Talents must be registered and networked into the National Al Directory (AI-DI): 57

Strategic Initiative 6.3 Establishing & Quadruple Helix Collaborative Platform for AIl ReDel The Government-Academia-Industry-Society Collaboration is fundamental for the success of the Al Innovation Ecosystem and is the enabler of the National Al Use Cases implementation_ The collaboration effort must outline its expectations and targeted achievements_ All parties that will involve in this consortium must embrace the similar fundamental belief towards the national agenda: The consortium pact must be impervious to stagnation that can jeopardise its roles and functions. To facilitate the consortium in performing its expected roles and duties, working structure or a formal committee, with endorsement from the government; must be in place. The Strategic Initiative 6.3 ensures that the quad-helix collaboration is nurtured at the earliest stage possible through 4 key activities: Establishing the Malaysia Al Alliance (MyAI-Alliance), which brings together Al collaborators from the government; academia  industries and societies_ to support the implementation of the Al-IE, in Horizon MyAI-Alliance will connect and promote collaborations among all the different quadruple helix actors to engage in the National Al Use Cases and other collaborative arrangements _ Because MyAI-Alliance also consists of Al experts it can provide technical advice to the government on matters  related to when   engaging with  international partners e.g: through the ASEAN Committee on Science, Technology and Innovations (ASEAN COSTI): The alliance should also participate actively in Al discussions held globally, for example on the official discussion platform of the United Nation Commissions on Science & Technology for Development (CSTD): Formulate an Al Investment Fund Guidelines for Al start-upS, in Horizon 2_ Establish the National Directory of Al experts and companies (Al-DI); in Horizon 2, to allow national and international entities to search for our local Al experts and organizations collaborate with: Establish a regional Al in Supply Chain Centre of Excellence that focuses on quadruple helix collaboration on Al R&D&I in Supply Chain to establish Malaysia as the regional global Al leader in supply chain management sector;, in Horizon 3_ This pursuit will be part of our initiatives to position Malaysia as the leader in Al-driven SCM: 73 key any

Malaysia as World Leader in Al-Driven Supply Chain Supply chain can essentially be defined as any environment or ecosystem across which there is a flow of resources. These resources can be physical such as products and materials or nonphysical such as human or services_ Why supply chain? Malaysia's economic foundations are based primarily on manufacturing, plantation, trading, logistics and distribution, and retail activities These strengths are punctuated by Malaysia boasting two of the top five ports in Southeast Asia. These foundational activities thrive on an efficient, agile and resilient supply chain, the backbone of Malaysia's and global economy: As the supply chain becomes more complex and more sophisticated, the challenges, in terms of being able to adapt to constantly evolving needs and constraints, has rapidly become beyond human capacity to manage: Global trends in digitization, digitalization and digital transformation reinforce the need transformation towards a more resilient, agile, intelligent and efficient supply chain. While other countries strategically focus on specific areas of Al such as national security, defence, cybersecurity, energy and healthcare to drive their national agenda, at least, in the public arena, it is therefore proposed that Malaysia places a strategic focus on A in Supply Chain Management (SCM): National Al Use Cases and Supply Chain Management (SCM): 4 of the 11 proposed National Al Use Cases are directly addressing different supply chain management challenges 78 for

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1.1 INTRODUCTION Artificial intelligence AT ) and data analytics have the potential to enhance social well-being and are increasingly being to various business areas to improve operational efficiency and to provide new services, but at the same time this can about  different challenges. It is important  for organisations to consider AI and data   ethics when   implementing  Information Technology (IT"" projects and providing services. When organisations are considering the application of Al and data analytics, they need to consider range of factors   such as the requirements of relevant legislation and stakeholder expectations on the applicable ethical standards of data and technology that appropriately reflect the value and culture of the local community. The Ethical Artificial Intelligence Framework (called the  Ethical AI Framework hereunder) document consists of: Tailored AI Framework for ethical use of Al and big data analytics when implementing IT projects; and An assessment template (used to complete AI Assessment"" for AI and data analytics to assess the implications of AI applications In this document, the term AI is used to refer to analytic operations involving big data analytics, advanced analytics and machine learning that use massive data sets and processing capabilities to find correlations and make predictions. The term *AI applications"" has been used to refer to a collective set of applications whose actions, decisions 0r predictions are empowered by AI models. Examples of AI applications are IT projects which have prediction functionality and/or model development involving training data. For IT projects that have AL applications, organisations can make reference to the requirements of the Ethical Al Framework The adoption of Ethical AI Framework is a step that establishes a common approach and structure to govern the development and deployment of Al applications with the intention to maximise the benefits of the application of AI in IT projects based on the following guiding principles: Facilitate organisations to understand the application of Al and big data analytics in their respective business areas; Complement other operating guidelines (e:g: privacy, security and data management); Foster and guide the ethical use of Al and big data analytics in the organisation; 1-2 big applied bring big big

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Facilitate organisations to consider requirements o AI ethics relevant to their business and technical domains, govern and assess the compliance of the IT projects; and Assist organisations on identifying and managing potential risks in adopting Al and big data analytics in IT projects by conducting AI Assessment: 1.2 WHAT IS THE ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK? The Ethical AI Framework was originally developed to assist government bureaux/departments (BIDs"") in planning, designing and implementing Al and big data analytics in their IT projects and services. It consists of guiding principles, leading practices and AI Assessment that should be adopted for B/Ds' AI-powered IT projects. The AI Assessment includes assessment template for B/Ds to utilise at application level which would support BIDs o the management of benefits, impact and risks. Nonetheless this framework,  including   guiding  principles,  practices and assessment  template, is also applicable to other organisations in general and this customised version of framework is suitably revised (e.g: removal or adjustment of government specific terms) for general reference by organsiations when adopting Al and big data analytics in their IT projects.

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The AI Assessment includes an assessment   template for  organisations to assess the benefits, impact and risks of AI applications An AI Application Impact Assessment is used to assess AI applications to ensure that the impact across the AI Lifecycle is managed and that related Ethical Al Principles have been considered. Please refer to Section 5 AI Assessment"" for details. Existing standards and practices (e.g: project management, IT security standards) should be used as part of the overall framework for managing IT projects Al applications would be a subset of these projects. Ethical_AL Principles Twelve Ethical AI Principles  should be observed for all AI projects. Two out of the twelve principles (1) Transparency and Interpretability and (2) Reliability, Robustness and Security are 'Performance Principles"" These fundamental  principles must be achieved to create a foundation for the execution of other principles: For example, without achieving the Reliability; Robustness and Security principle, it would be impossible to accurately verify that other Ethical AI Principles have always been followed. The other principles are categorised as ""General Principles"" , including (1) Fairness, (2) Diversity and Inclusion, (3) Human Oversight; (4) Lawfulness and Compliance, (5) Data Privacy, Safety, (7) Accountability, (8) Beneficial AI, (9) Cooperation and Openness and (10) Sustainability and Just   Transition. are derived   from the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Ordinances: Principle Definition Transparency and Organisations should be able to explain the decision-making processes Interpretability of the Al applications to humans in a clear and comprehensible manner: Reliability, Like other IT applications, AI applications should be developed such Robustness and that will operate reliably over periods of time using the right Security models and datasets while ensuring are both robust (i.e. providing consistent results and capable to handle errors, and remain secure against cyber-attacks as required by the relevant legal and industry frameworks Fairness The recommendation/result from the AI applications should treat individuals within similar groups in a fair manner, without favouritism or discrimination and without causing or resulting in harm. This entails maintaining respect for the individuals behind the data and refraining from datasets that contain discriminatory biases. Diversity and Inclusion and diverse usership through the AI application should be Inclusion promoted by understanding and respect the interests of all stakeholders impacted. Human Oversight The degree of human intervention required as part of AT application $ decision-making or operations should be dictated by the level of the perceived severity of ethical issues. Lawfulness and Organisations responsible for an AI application should always act in Compliance accordance with the law and regulations and relevant regulatory regimes. 1-4 They Hong Kong they long they using

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK EXECUTIVE SUMMARY of the project development can be a continuous exercise. This is because an AI model can often benefit from better Or more data for iterative model training throughout the development process. The approach of conventional software lifecycle is to program the IT application with a set of instructions for a pre-defined set of events  Thereafter; the IT application will exploit its computing capabilities and other resources to process the data fed into the system. This is different from an AI application where a huge amount of data are fed into the application, which in turn processes all the data resulting in a trained model 0 Al solution: This trained model is then used to solve new problems. There is often a continual feedback loop between the development and deployment stages, as well as system operation and monitoring of the AI Lifecycle for iterative improvements making this distinct from a traditional software development lifecycle.

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW 3. OVERVIEW OF THE ETHICAL A FRAMEWORK 3.1 VISION FOR THE ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK The vision for the Ethical AL Framework is to enable organisations to manage potential ethical issues and implications through assessing their AI capabilities and applications. This   enables delivery of ethical AI whilst managing the potential impact of Al applications. The   purpose of this   section is to   provide an overview of the Ethical AI Framework for organisations. Examples used are taken from different sources and are purely for illustrative purposes only. 3.2 OBJECTIVES The objectives of the Ethical AI Framework are: To support organisations to understand Ethical Al and its applications by: establishing Ethical AI Principles with definitions, practices and guidelines; and defining roles and responsibilities for organisations when implementing Ethical AI: To the ethical use of AL in organisations by: providing a description of activities to be covered throughout all stages of the AI Lifecycle and the corresponding capabilities required to apply ethical AI; and providing practical guidelines for organisations to observe and apply when incorporate AI in IT projects to ensure ethical adoption. To assist organisations to govern the compliance of Al applications providing an AI Application Impact Assessment template that enables organisations to assess their Al application over a set of practical considerations for implementing ethical AI 3.3 BENEFITS The adoption of Ethical AI Framework is a foundation step that establishes a common approach and structure to govern the subsequent development and deployment of Al applications Benefits ofhaving an Ethical AI Framework include: Establishing common best practices to ensure organisations have guidance and references to adopt Al in IT projects with appropriate ethical considerations Identifying the benefits, risks and impacts of an AI application to enable better risk mitigation decisions that maximise benefits. Acting as a bridge   between the strategy and  execution which helps ensure the AI application is aligned with organisations vision and needs. 3-2 guide they by:

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW 3.4 INTRODUCTION TO AI AND DATA ETHICS In the age of big data, enormous quantities of data are being generated, collected and analysed to identify insights and support decisions making: Big data are often described in terms of the five Vs where: volume refers to the vast quantity of the data available; velocity refers to the at which data must be stored and/or analysed to provide the right information at the right time to make appropriate management decisions; variety refers to a huge variation in types and sources of data including both structure and unstructured data (e.g: file objects, social media feeds, tags, data from sensors, audio, image and video); veracity refers to the trustworthiness of the data over its accuracy and quality; and value refers to the ability to transform data to improve outcomes/values. Analytical techniques that are used to analyse big data are often being described as advanced analytics, machine learning and AI. These technical terms have similar meanings and overlap with each other: They all refer to analytic operations that take advantage of volume data describing the past   situations  (i.e. historical data), and massive  processing   capabilities   and advanced algorithms, and that use them to find correlations and make predictions with acceptable accuracy: In a broad definition, Al is a collective term for computer systems that can sense their environment, think, learn and take actions in response to the gathered data, with the ultimate of fulfilling their objectives. Al systems are a collection of interrelated technologies used to help solve problems autonomously and perform tasks to achieve defined objectives without explicit guidance from a human being: We can distinguish the four main categories of AI (see Figure 7): https: WWW ibm com/blogs/watson-health/the-S-Vs-of-big-data/ 3-3 speed large - goal design

These applications do not necessarily learn from their interactions with the environment, and the final decision maker is eventually a human agent Their objective is to facilitate human beings in performing cognitive tasks faster and better, improving what human beings and organisations are already doing: A simple example, prevalent in cars today; is the Global Positioning System (GPS"") navigation program that offers directions to drivers with adjustments to road conditions Augmented Intelligence: This category includes Alapplications that augment human decision making and continuously learn from their interactions with human and the environment they operate in: They do not make decisions autonomously and their objective is to assist humankind in making better decisions, enabling them and organisations to do things they could not otherwise do. Automated Intelligence: This category refers to the automation of manual/cognitive and routine/non-routine tasks. However; it does not involve new ways of functioning since the objective is simply to automate existing tasks. Examples of Automated Intelligence are Robotic Process Automation applications used to automate back-office processes. A key characteristic of these applications is that there is ""no human-in-the-loop' meaning the system makes decisions in a completely autonomous manner: Autonomous Intelligence: The of these AI applications is to automate decision making processes without human intervention. To achieve this goal, they learn from their interactions with human beings, as well as with their environment: Examples of Autonomous Intelligence solutions are autonomous vehicles, robots, chatbots and virtual assistants. https | WWW pWC com/gx/en/news-room/docs/report-pWC-ai-analysis-sizing-the-prize https: / wwW pWc com/gx/en/news-room/docs report-PWC-ai-analysis-sizing-the-prize pdf 3-4 doing beings goal _pdf

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW Definitions of some ethical AI terms are as follows: AI Ethics: The consideration of ethical implications as they relate to the use, development; implementation o outcome of AI AI Ethics can be considered a subset of Data Ethics. Ethical AI Principles: A set of behavioural principles related to the use, development; implementation or outcome of AI Data Ethics: Branch of ethics that studies and evaluates moral problems related to data (including generation, recording, curation, processing, dissemination, sharing and use), algorithms   (including Al/machine   learning   models, artificial  agents  and robots) and corresponding practices (including responsible innovation, programming, hacking and professional codes) in order to formulate and support morally solutions (e.g: right conducts or right values). 3.5 KEY COMPONENTS AND RELATIONSHIPS The components of the Ethical AI Framework are depicted in Figure &. Details  of the components are described in the subsequent sections (i.e. Section 4 AI Practice Guide"" and Section 5 AI Assessment"" )_ The Ethical AI Framework  should be read in conjunction with existing standards and practices for IT and project management.

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW The Ethical AI Framework consists of the following components: The Tailored AI Framework, which consists of the following sub-components: The Ethical AI Principles   define principles to be    followed when  designing and developing AL applications. The Ethical AI Principles are applicable to all roles as defined in the AI Governance Structure; The AI Governance Structure defines standard structures and roles and responsibilities over the adoption process of Al against practices set out in the Ethical AI Framework; The AI Lifecycle defines an AI lifecycle model that is used to structure the layout of practices in the AI Practice Guide and the questions in the AI Assessment; and The AI Practice Guide defines a set of practices for all stages in the Al Lifecycle The guiding practices are derived from the Ethical Al Principles. The AI Assessment consists of the AI Application Impact Assessment template which defines questions to be answered by target readers across the stages as of the AI Lifecycle to assess the impact of AL applications and to ensure that Ethical Al Principles have been considered. Target  readers of the Ethical AI Framework  include IT Planners, System Analysts,  System Architects and Data Scientists. Data Scientists   encompass a role   including   development; deployment and monitoring Al for the Ethical AL Framework These areas can also be separate roles depending on the individual setup of the organisations. These target readers should leverage the Ethical AI Framework to: understand Ethical AI Principles and practices; initiate discussions on the impact of AI; adopt standardised of practices and terminology; and perform AI Assessment For IT Planners and Executives Project Strategy IT Planners and Executives can refer to Section 4.1.1 ""Project Strategy""' of the AI Practice Guide to establish organisational Al/data strategy, and to ensure Ethical AI Principles are embedded and relevant regulations and ordinances are considered. Project Planning IT Planners in organisations can refer to Section 4.1.2 Project Planning""' of the AI Practice Guide with the risk gating criteria within the AI Application Impact Assessment to ensure ethical AI requirements are met, impacts are effectively assessed, and to determine which Al projects require further review at senior level. Ethics, roles and responsibilities for AI should be taken into consideration: 3-6 part along

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW Project Ecosystem IT Planners can refer to Section 4.1.3 ""Project Ecosystem of the AI Practice Guide when evaluating the existing technology landscape, business needs and sourcing (procurement) options to identify technology gaps IT planners who work with the sourcing team and the Project Team should refer to this section for considerations when deploying third-party AI applications. Existing change   management  procedures are to be followed when  making changes to existing systems/Al applications. For System Analysts, System Architects and Data Scientists Project Development System Analysts and System Architects (who are responsible for developing data plumbing which transforms   and  feeds data to the AI applications) and Data   Scientists   (who are responsible for performing development of Al applications) can refer to Section 4.1.4 ""Project Development"" of the AI Practice Guide to ensure   aspects such as data validation, documentation, biased data, data privacy, training, testing and AI modelling techniques are considered for ethical AI. System Deployment Data Scientists (who are responsible for managing the integration, scaling and deployment of AL applications, managing post-deployment performance and stability of AL applications) can refer to Section 4.1.5 ""System Deployment"" of the AI Practice Guide for areas specifically related to deployment of Al applications such as integration, testing, feedback tuning metrics and performance checks. System Operation and Monitoring Data Scientists (who are responsible for monitoring Al systems and ensuring actions are taken to address feedback from the AL applications) can refer to Section 4.1.6 ~System Operation and Monitoring"" of the Al Practice Guide to ensure actions including escalation, continuous review and compliance checking on internal  requirements  and  external   expectations are considered. 3.5.1 Ethical AI Principles Twelve Ethical AI Principles  should be observed for all AI projects. Two out of the twelve principles (1) Transparency and Interpretability and (2) Reliability, Robustness and Security are ~Performance   Principles"" These   fundamental   principles must be achieved to create a foundation for the execution of other principles. For example, without achieving the Reliability, 3-7 loops,

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW Robustness and Security principle, it would be impossible to accurately verify that other Ethical AI Principles have always been followed: The other principles are categorised as ""General Principles"" , including (1) Fairness, (2) Diversity and Inclusion, (3) Human Oversight; (4) Lawfulness and Compliance, (5) Data Privacy, (6) Safety; (7) Accountability, (8) Beneficial AI, (9) Cooperation and   Openness and (10) Sustainability and Just Transition.   They are derived from  the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Ordinances. Definitions for the principles are listed in Table 4 with further details provided in subsequent subsections. Principle Definition Transparency and Organisations should be able to explain decision-making Interpretability processes   of the AI applications to humans in a clear and comprehensible manner. Reliability, Robustness Like other IT applications, AI applications should be developed and Security such that will operate reliably over periods of time the right models and datasets while ensuring are both robust (i.e. providing consistent results and capable to handle errors) and remain secure against cyber-attacks as required by the relevant legal and industry frameworks Fairness The recommendation/result from the AI applications should treat individuals within   similar  groups in a fair   manner; without favouritism Or discrimination and without causing Or resulting in harm: This entails maintaining respect for the individuals behind the data and   refraining from using datasets that contain discriminatory biases. Diversity and Inclusion Inclusion and diverse usership through the AT application should be promoted by understanding and respect the interests of all stakeholders impacted. Human Oversight The   degree of human intervention   required as part of AI application's decision-making O operations should be dictated by the level of the perceived severity of ethical issues Lawfulness and Organisations responsible for an AI application should always Compliance act in accordance with the law and regulations and relevant regulatory regimes. 3-8 Hong Kong they long using they

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW Principle Definition Sustainability and Just The AI development should ensure that mitigation strategies are Transition in place to manage any potential societal and environmental system impacts  Table 4: Ethical Al Principles and Definitions 3.5.1.1 Transparency and Interpretability Principle: Organisations  should be able to explain decision-making processes of the AI applications to humans in a clear and comprehensible manner: Interpretability is the notion of creating human-understandable explanations of an Al model'$ characteristics (e.g. features and parameters), as well as the decision-making pathways for each individual prediction. Such interpretations may be of interest to various stakeholders of AI. Related areas include understanding AI, ensuring models are explainable, transparency of processes, reproducibility and trust. Across both global and local literature, it is recognised there is a need to be able to explain what AI actually does in a clear way. To create robust and trusted AI applications, an understanding of inner functioning of their models, as well as the data used at training and decision-making times is imperative. Organisations should be interested in understanding the inner workings of AL models to evaluate   and   establish trust in  utilising AI-driven solutions and make more confident decisions; Data scientists may consult interpretation reports to decide whether a model should be deployed, or to facilitate better communication and collaboration with their peers, system analysts, system architects and managers; and governance bodies may require comprehensive and immutable interpretation reports ofan Al model for auditing purposes. Whatever the case may be, this necessitates an ethical principle that obliges AI developers to consider building interpretability capabilities into AL applications. Interpretability methods can be used to   generate   textual or visual   explanations of  models from two different perspectives, depending on the use case and stakeholders. Please refer to Section 4.1.4.1 ""Business and Data   Understanding""    for   further details. For  those   complicated  machine learning algorithms (e.g: neural networks), hyper-parameters of algorithms should be properly documented. For example, for Al applications involving the use of neural networks, hyper- parameters   such as  number of layers, activation  functions  and error  functions should be properly documented. Interpretability can encompass   Explainability, Transparency and  Provability which are explained below. 3-10

Page 28:

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW Explainability Explainability refers to the degree to which a decision made by an AI application can be understood by a human expert. Depending on whether the data, algorithms and configurations of an AI model are available at the time of interpretation, two approaches can be taken to generate human-readable explanations: Built-in Interpretation: Some models inherently have the ability to explain their behaviour. For example, decision trees are essentially a cascade of questions and work comparably to the way humans think. When executing against a data (using its features and values)_ the pathways to reach a decision can be simply reported back to human users. Similarly, linear models like Logistic Regression are fairly intuitive and easy to explain to a non- expert in data science, as the data points can be visualised in a plot against the learned probability line, and Feature Importance metrics can be calculated, and absolute values reported back to data scientists Post-hoc Interpretation: Post-hoc   interpretation of an AI model is an effort beyond exploratory data analysis  techniques to understand its behaviour after it has  finished training, O when the model is in production and only accessible through an Application Programming Interface (~APT ). While post-hoc interpretation is less likely to elucidate the exact inner workings of a model, it can help end-users to approximate the behaviour of the model by way of examples, surrogate models or visualisation of Feature Importance and Partial Dependence plots. Depending on which stakeholder is on the receiving end of the interpretation, natural language explanations of a model's behaviour can be generated using techniques from the Natural Language Generation ( NLG"") domain to create. Note, there is an  inherent  trade-off between  explainability and accuracy of machine learning algorithms. Nonparametric machine learning algorithms O models with a very large number of parameters (e.g. deep neural networks or ensemble models) can learn complex, latent   patterns from large-scale data and offer   flexibility and   superior performance, at the cost of being *opaque"" in nature. In contrast; parametric models, such as Naive Bayesian or Simple Neural Networks, that can be trained with a set of fixed parameters are easier to explain but often are less performant though this is not always the case. In addition to the type, size and complexity of training data that usually dictate the learning models, the safety-critical nature of the AI application and desired level of explanation should be considered at design time. Transparency Transparency is notably the most critical characteristic of building trust into Al models. Trust is dynamic, developed and strengthened in a gradual manner: It is realised through carefully designing a process to minimise risk, and therefore, plays a crucial role in the widespread adoption of new, disruptive technologies like AI. Trust is hard to come by and builds upon several   factors including purpose and performance of the AI applications, as well as the technology provider (e.g organisation's brand reputation, level of transparency in operations, reliability and being able to explain the rationale behind the Al models decisions are crucial  for building and maintaining trusts The Transparency principle calls  for the 3-11 point design;

Page 29:

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW adoption of a clear; honest communication channel between an organisation and its end-users and regulators, when needed, and its indispensable nature. The stochastic nature of AI applications makes them fundamentally different from conventional software development paradigms In what follows, we iterate possible ways of embedding Transparency into the design of Al applications based on Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ( IEEE"") standards: Transparency as Traceability: The transparency of the software engineering process during implementation that should   allow technical   inspection of which norms have been implemented, explicitly and implicitly, for which contexts, and how possible conflicts are resolved. Transparency as Verifiability: This concerns how normative reasoning is approached in the implementation and how it is possible to verify that the normative decisions the system makes match the   required norms and values using possibly explicit and exact representations with the objective to provide the basis for a range of strong mathematical techniques, such as formal verification: Verifiability is also important in case of failure, in the sense that if an AI application causes harm, it should be possible to ascertain why, in case of judicial decision-making involving an AI model, it must be possible to provide satisfactory explanation auditable by a competent human authoritys. Transparency aS Non-deception and Honest Design: stakeholder of the global AI community has a strong and shared interest in avoiding Al applications autonomously creating any information Or content in any form (text; audio, video) that intentionally represent states of the world that do not correspond partially or entirely to specific states of fact with the intent of deceiving any third-party (human or machines). Of course, in certain use cases   of AI application   deception may be necessary in  serving the core functionality of the system (e.g. in case of gaming, entertainment and art applications), but those actions are no longer norm violations because are justified by context and user consent?. Transparency as Personal Privacy: People should have the right to access, manage and control the data generate and that can be used by AI applications common misconception regarding Transparency is a belief that organisations must reveal their A-related intellectual property (e.g. source code, models' configurations, comprehensive views of their data sets  to provide for a ""transparent Al . On the contrary, the Transparency principle  calls   for the   adoption of a clear; honest   communication channel   between an organisation and its end-users and regulators, when needed, and its indispensable nature. Otherwise, the for-profit"" nature of many Al applications, as well as third-party Al vendors` business models would never allow organisations to adhere to this principle. In fact; having a very detailed transparency level with end-users of an AI application would possibly make it susceptible to being gamed"" by malicious users. At the same time, auditors and regulators may require accurate, exhaustive views into the organisation's AL-driven processes. In such cases, the level of transparency may be decided by the organisation as seen fit: https Istandards iece org/content/dam/iccc-standards/standards/web/documents/other/ead_v2 pdf https //standards iecc org/content/dam/icce-standards/standards/web/documents/other/ead_v2 pdf 3-12 and Any beings they they

Page 30:

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW Provability Provability refers to the mathematical certainty behind Al models' decisions. It mandates a higher level of formalism in   explaining an AI   application' $ behaviour. This   type of interpretability is geared more towards data scientists to place an Al model under scrutiny to ensure the decision-making policies of the model can be mathematically proved and remain consistent as changes in data and environment take place. Equitably, in many safety-critical AI applications, where the use of Al must be approved or certified by regulators, provability becomes indispensable. Examples_(please refer_to_Section 4 AL Practice Guide ' for further_examples and practices) Project Team should aim to embed elements of transparency into the AL applications and translate them into human language decision treelillustration to explain to users how decisions are made) This allows human to understand whether the decision made by AI has errors and fix the errors_ Provide examples to explain the Al decision-making process in narrative terms Or graphics (for example, drawing a workflow with decision trees) whenever possible for a non-technical audience to understand and visualise the Al operations better: Organisations should make explicit how different factors and data determine the outcomes and conclusions of their AI models 3.5.1.2 Reliability, Robustness and Security Principle: Like other IT applications, Al applications should be developed such that will operate reliably over periods of time using the right models and datasets while ensuring are both robust (i.e. providing consistent results and capable to handle errors) and remain secure against cyber-attacks as required by the relevant legal and industry frameworks. The overarching aim of the Reliability, Robustness and Security principle is to ensure that AL applications behave as intended, from training data to final output, over prolonged periods of time. Reliability is about increasing the likelihood of the system being fault-free. Robustness is to ensure that models perform when assumptions and variables change. Security is to protect the data and model itself: Across both global and local literature, it is recognised there is a need to ensure Al applications behave as intended. Areas in the literature include awareness of misuse, integrity, robustness, resilience, effectiveness, quality, appropriateness, accuracy and security. In particular, there is a focus on preventing harm: It is an indispensable requirement for Al applications to be designed and developed in a way that takes into consideration that environment; data and processes o which rely, change over time. Malevolent actors of AI applications can exploit such drifts in the Al operating 3-13 (e.g: using they long they they

Page 31:

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW environment with a variety of techniques to penetrate and fool Al models to make incorrect predictions with high confidence: The adoption of the Reliability, Robustness and Security principle assists organisations to identify potential weaknesses in an Al application, improve overall performance, withstand adversarial attacks, and monitor long term performance of AI models throughout their operational lifetime, and verifiably so where applicable and feasible. Reliability Fundamental to creating reliable software applications, Reliability is an engineering effort to maximise the probability that a system will perform its required functions fault-free within a specified time period and the environments As the complexity of Al algorithms and systems built upon them increases, the role of disciplined software engineering practices, such as standards and software tests, become more prominent to ensure two measures encompassed in reliability: Availability: The degree to which a system o component is operational and accessible when required, often expressed as a probability'. In safety-critical o real-time missions, the availability of Al applications is of high significance and the absence thereof can lead to potentially fatal consequences. Serviceability: Sometimes also referred to as Maintainability, is the degree of ease with which a system can be maintained o repaired. Changes to the infrastructure where AI systems are running 0, the requirements that Al models have to fulfil, as well as issues and bugs that surface over time, require the Al developers to periodically correct defects, analyse their root causes and prevent future failures. While quality and integrity are applicable to individuals adhering to industry best practices and organisational codes of conduct; it is also important that organisations closely monitor and manage the quality and integrity of the data being used to develop Al applications Data quality' determines the reliability of the information to serve an  intended purpose and attributes that define the usability of information, whereas data integrity refers to the reliability ofinformation in terms of its physical and logical validity - based on accuracy and consistency of the data across its lifecycle the absence of unintended change to the information between successive   updates. The considerations relating to data   quality and   integrity are consistency, accuracy, validity, timeliness, uniqueness and completeness. Robustness Robustness is a characteristic describing a model's ability to effectively perform while its variables or assumptions are altered: In order to ensure a model is robust; validations and error handling must be incorporated at every step of the data science pipeline, from data preparation and ingestion through to prediction: Robust models must perform consistently while being exposed to a new and independent (but http I www mitjyu filope/kurssitTIES462 /Materiaalit/IEEE_SoftwarcEngGlossary pdf http I www mitjyu filope/kurssitTIES462 /Materiaalit/IEEE_SoftwarcEngGlossary pdf 3-14 key

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW similar) datasets and be able to deal with the errors and corner cases that occur at execution time. Robustness also entails placing effective error handling measures in place to protect Al models when exposed to malicious inputs and parameters. Security Many of existing security practices conventional to software development efforts are also applicable for AI and machine learning models. As largely rely on data curated and integrated with public or third-party sources, they must be able to discern between malicious input and benign anomalous data. When designing security protocols extra care should be taken to cleanse, secure and encrypt data, as well as designing access controls to the trained model. Adversarial attacks, the act of introducing small, intentional perturbations to data used to compel AI models to make incorrect predictions with high confidence, is one of such security risks. Additionally, for organisations that do not provide direct access to their Al models, but expose them as web services, designing security protocols that prevent attackers from reverse engineering their model is necessary: Examples (please refer to Section 4 AI Practice Guide ' for further examples and practices_ AI systems should be technically robust, and should be protected from any malicious use. Malicious actors can try to deceive Al models with inputs designed to learn about the AI and deceive it: Controls are necessary to ensure that the AL application will not be exposed to potential hackers who will train the AL model to perform tasks it was not intended to perform: When such cases happen, this will lead to liability and reputational risk to the organisation using the Al application: Continuous monitoring which includes validation;, verification of accuracy and maintenance of the model should be performed regularly to improve the security and robustness of AI. This is because hackers usually look for outdated software with security flaws which are more vulnerable to cyberattacks. constantly   updating the AI application, this will minimise such security risks. 3.5.1.3 Fairness Principle:   The recommendation/result  from the AI applications should treat individuals within similar groups in a fair manner, without favouritism or discrimination and without causing O resulting in harm: This entails maintaining respect for the individuals behind the data and refraining from using datasets that contain discriminatory biases. With regards to Fairness, Article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that Everyone is entitled t0 all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex; language, religion, political or other opinions, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Furthermore, no distinction 3-15 they i,e.- they By

Page 33:

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty"" It is therefore important for Al applications to limit discrimination or bias relative to the factors reported in the Article. The same principle against discrimination is included in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women: The following is a list of key legal terminology for consideration when understanding Fairness 10 and how it applies to organisations O Al applications implementation: Prejudice: Prejudice means to injure or harm a person'$ rights. Discrimination:  Discrimination means the   adverse, unfair or detrimental treatment; preference, exclusion O distinction of a person because of the person '$ race, colour, sex, sexual orientation, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family or   carer' $ responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction O social origin: Impartiality: Impartiality means to act Or make a decision based 0n merit and according to the law without bias, influence, preconception or unreasonableness. Positive Discrimination: Positive Discrimination means the: treatment of a person; taking of an action affecting a person; and/or making of a decision affecting a person because of that person s race, colour; sex; sexual orientation, age, physical O mental disability, marital status, family Or carer'$ responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or  social origin that is done with the intention of achieving: substantive equality; equal enjoyment; equal exercise of human rights; and/or equal exercise of fundamental freedoms for that person. It is   paramount to   acknowledge that fairess is a social construct. There are many mathematical definitions of fairness, and when we choose one, we violate some aspects of the others. In other words, it is impossible for every decision to be truly fair to all parties. No AI application can be universally fair or unbiased""i 12. However, Al applications can be designed to meet specific fairness goals, thus mitigating some of the perceived unfairness and creating a more responsible system overall. Examples_(please refer to_Section 4 AL Practice Guide ' for further_examples and practices) Training data should be free from any bias characteristics such as sample size disparity (where there is significantly less data for minority groups), selection bias (where certain groups are less likely to be selected); bias in model design and bias in model use and feedback (e.g: by checking for stereotyping certain groups when relying on data and 10 Please note that often there is no universal legal meaning for these words/phrases and that particular definitions can differ based on their purpose and the circumstances of that situation. Therefore, in this context the definitions are purposefully broad and relatively simple; taking into account the context in which are t0 be used (i.e_ broad-based decision-making framework) https: WWW strategy-business com/article What-is-fair-when-it-comes-to-AL-bias?gko_-82Zc0 http |www jennwv com/papers/checklists_pdf 3-16 they

Ensure integrity of source data   obtained to help ensure a fair outcome from the AI application Data which are invalid or inaccurate, when used to train an AI model, will lead to biased decisions and affected users will be discriminated unintentionally due to the flaw in datasets. 3.5.1.4 Diversity and Inclusion Principle: Inclusion and diverse usership through the AI application should be promoted by understanding and respecting the interests of all stakeholders impacted. This principle works under the assumption that local cultural norms do not contradict either any general O performance principles. Al can be used globally by a great variety of people Their interpretation of the an AI application behaves can consequently differ: To achieve Diversity and Inclusion, it is important to involve the largest possible number of AL users representing the broadest variety of cultures, interests, lifestyles and disciplines. Examples (please refer to Section 4 AI Practice Guide ""' for further examples and practices): AI application developers should always consider people of different backgrounds, races and gender. If such differences were not considered, the AI application might behave differently   towards certain groups of  individuals  causing  inconvenience. One such example is Alrecruiting tool showing preference towards Caucasians because the tool was developed by Caucasians. 3.5.1.5 Human Oversight Principle: The degree of human intervention required as part of Al application's decision- making Or operations should be dictated by the level of the perceived severity of ethical issues. Human oversight is the capability ofhumans in making choices that is to think and determine an outcome and consequently enact upon it. AI applications are regarded as autonomous systems to various degrees and as become prevalent in our lives, their function in real- world contexts is often correlated with fear and uncertainty. Examples_(please refer to_Section 4 AL Practice Guide"" for further examples and practices) Ensure an appropriate level of human intervention based on multiple factors such as the benefits and risks of the Al application; impacts of the Al decision, operational cost and 3-17 way they

Page 35:

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW evolving societal norms and values. Having some level of human intervention will also reduce job displacement risk: Controls should be implemented that allow for human intervention o auto-shutdown in the event of system failure especially when the system failure will have an impact on human safety. One such example is autonomous vehicle where human should be given the to prevent the vehicle from causing accidents if it failed to detect human on the road. 3.5.1.6 Lawfulness and Compliance Principle: Organisations responsible for an Al application should always act in accordance with the law and regulations and relevant regulatory regimes. In all cases, the principles that Al applications must adhere to are contained in international treaties or regulations as well as in national legislations and industry standards. It is therefore indispensable for any organisation dealing with the development 0r implementation of AI applications to master and apply consistently all relevant obligations emanated by legislative sources at any level. Examples_(please refer_to_Section 4_ AL Practice Guide ' for further_examples and practices) AI system developed must be in compliance with regulations and laws Ifthere are no laws to the use of AI, humans with bad intentions will develop Al applications that will cause harm. Compliance review processes for AL applications should be defined to keep track of regulatory changes and to ensure that the policies and processes are compliant. 3.5.1.7 Data Privacy Principle: Individuals should have the right to: a be informed ofthe purpose of collection and potential transferees of their personal data and that personal data shall only be collected for a lawful purpose, by using lawful and fair means, and that the amount of personal data collected should not be excessive in relation to the purpose. Please refer to the Data Protection Principles (DPP"")l ""Purpose and Manner of Collection"" of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (the ""PD(P)O ) b be assured that data users take all practicable steps to ensure that personal data are accurate and is not kept longer than is necessary. Please refer to the DPPZ Accuracy and Duration of Retention"" of the PD(P)O. require that personal data shall only be used for the original purpose of collection and any directly related purposes. Otherwise, express and voluntary consent of the individuals is required. Please refer to the DPP3 ""Use of Personal Data' of the PD(P)O: 3-18 option govern

Please refer to the DPP4 *Security of Personal Data"" of the PD(P)O. be provided with information on (i) its policies and practices in relation to personal data, (ii) the kinds of personal data held; and (iii) the main purposes for which the personal data are to be used. Please refer to the DPPS ' Information to Be Generally Available"" of the PD(P)O. 13 Individuals should have the right to expect that organisations will process data that pertains to them in a manner that creates benefits for the individual or for a broader community of people. In cases where the organisations receive most of the benefit; a demonstrable vetting process should determine there is minimal impact on an individual. Individuals should have the right to control data uses that are highly consequential to them. This should be facilitated through an appropriate level and contextual application of consent and access where possible Where consent is not possible, suitable o less impactful, have the right to know that accountability processes assure the data uses are fair and responsible'4 Ithas been recognised by many legislations at all levels across the globe and locally that people have the right to be informed with respect to the use of their personally identifiable data. This is particularly important in the case of Al applications where datasets possibly containing personal and sensitive information are used to train machine learning algorithms Additionally, people need to understand their digital personas, as well as the way they interact in digital environments, are profoundly different from real life. Examples (please refer to Section 4 AL Practice Guide ' for further examples and_practices) Communicate clearly how, why, where, and when customer data are used in Al systems. Ensure minimal collection and processing of personal data and retention policies are followed which take into account privacy regulations such as PD(P)O and the related PD(P)O guidance notes. 3.5.1.8 Safety Principle: Throughout their operational lifetime, Al applications should not compromise the physical safety O mental integrity of mankind. For safety, unintended risks ofharm should be minimised inclusive of physical, emotional and environmental safety. With the evolution and improvement of Al application performance in terms of both cognitive capabilities  and level of autonomy, the risk of unanticipated or unintended behaviours increases correspondingly. Different and possibly dangerous scenarios By individuals we include individuals and groups of individuals 14 Not all uses of data are suitable for control _ e.g: data used for security analysis 3-19 they they

Page 37:

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW could arise in which Al applications attempt to take control over their own reward systems Or where the learning system fails with unpredictable consequences. It is also necessary to determine who is responsible for what and to this regard it is possible to say that designers and builders of advanced AI applications are stakeholders in the moral implications of their use, misuse, and actions, with a responsibility and opportunity to shape those implications Examples_(please refer_to_Section 4_ AL Practice Guide ' for further_examples and practices) Where Al tools are used to augment human in decision-making, they should be safe, trustworthy, and aligned with the ethics and preferences of people who are influenced by their actions. If robots are deployed to provide care for the elderly, the robot should not cause physical O mental harm to the elderly. 3.5.1.9 Accountability Principle: Organisations are responsible for the moral implications of their use and misuse of AI applications. There   should also be a clearly identifiable   accountable party, be it an individual or an organisational entity (e:g: the Al solution provider) Accountability ensures the responsibilities and liability of stakeholders are made clear and that people can be held accountable. This includes ensuring that responsibilities are fulfilled from planning through to record-keeping: Accountability is a fundamental mentioned in literature both locally and globally. It is a cornerstone   principle  in most   privacy  frameworks and/or legislation: It is  necessary to determine who is responsible for what, and in this regard, it is possible to say that designers and builders of advanced AI systems are stakeholders in the moral implications of their use, misuse and actions, with a responsibility and opportunity to shape those implications Accountability is into action through a comprehensive, end-to-end governance process. Governance   typically  refers  to the   collective set  of policies, procedures   and  oversight internally and externally that manages the risk of systems and meets required obligations. This will help management of ethical responsibilities and assist to track and mitigate risks related to big data and Al projects. By introducing an appropriate governance framework, this can balance the need for innovation within the organisation and the need to safeguard the public interest. Examples (please refer to Section 4 AI Practice Guide ""' for further examples and practices) People and organisations responsible for the creation and implementation of Alalgorithms should be identifiable and accountable for the impacts ofthat algorithm, even if the impacts are unintended. When AI causes damage and there is no responsible party, the end user affected will not be compensated fairly. 3-20 being put

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW 3.5.1.10 Beneficial AI Principle: The development of AI should promote the common good. AI applications should not cause harm to humanity and should instead positively promote the common and wellbeing: Technologies can be created with the best intentions, but without considering well-being metrics, can still have dramatic negative consequences o people'$ mental health, emotions, sense of themselves, their autonomy, their ability to achieve their and other dimensions of well-being; AI applications can be ethical, legal, profitable and safe in their usage and yet not positively contribute to human   well-being   Wellbeing metrics that include   psychological, social, economic   fairness,  and environmental factors could enable a better   evaluation of the technological progress benefits while able to test for unintended negative consequences of Al to impact and diminish human well-being: Examples_(please refer to_Section 4 AL Practice Guide""' for further_examples and practices_ Development of Al should promote the progress of society and human civilisation, create smarter working methods and lifestyles, and enhance people's livelihood and welfare. If the AI application does not show any benefits to the human civilisation, people may opt out of using AI application because it does not benefit them. AI that does not promote common may hurt and destroy the well-being ofthe society: One such example includes the autonomous weapon which will cause great danger to human race 3.5.1.11 Cooperation and Openness Principle: A culture of multi-stakeholder open cooperation in the AI ecosystem should be fostered. Cooperation and Openness are about   building trust. It   includes different stakeholder collaborating and communicating with end-users and other impacted groups on risks and plans to handle these risks This principle is emphasised for educating the public about Al to help build trust'. The endeavour  of developing or implementing AI applications   should be an open and collaborative process involving a diverse internal team and engagement with diverse end-user groups within the community. In this regard, organisations should proactively collaborate with 15 https: / www pWc ch/en/publications/20]Zpwc_responsible_artificial_intelligence_2017_en pdf 3-21 good goals being good

Page 39:

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW any type of stakeholders, ranging from end-user to universities, research centres, governments and professional associations in order to help to mitigate the risk of exclusion and inherent biases within the AI application: Examples (please refer to Section 4 AI Practice Guidel for further examples and practices): Organisations should actively seek to develop and enhance Al application cross domain, cross sector and cross organisation. If there is no cooperation between different teams, the AI model may make biased decisions due to lack of diverse opinions/user testing: Project Managers can work together with the Project Team as well as end-users to perform testing before deployment. 3.5.1.12 Sustainability and Just Transition Principle: The AI development should ensure that mitigation strategies are in place to manage any potential societal and environmental system impacts. AI can help transform traditional sectors and systems to societal and environmental challenges as well as bolster human well-being: Although AI presents transformative opportunities to address some of the societal and environmental challenges, left unguided, it also has the capability to accelerate the society and environment's degradation The deployment of AI applications potentially carries profound societal and environmental impacts as in the case of worker displacement or in the areas of caring for the elderly, sick and disabled (e.g. can AI robots replace humans and how does this impact people being cared for), education and planet preservation: To develop a sustainable AI, the ultimate is to ensure that it becomes values- aligned with humanity, promising safe application of technology for humankind. In practice, this means checks and balances developed to ensure that evolving AI applications remain sustainable. This means that there is a need to guarantee that AI applications (with possible societal and environmental impacts= are implemented with an appropriate mitigation plan: Examples (please refer to Section 4 AI Practice Guide ""' for further examples and practices) AI system can be used to contribute to lesser carbon footprint: AI technology can be used to optimise power utilisation at data centres and help save energy. AI technology infrastructure should be scalable to sustain for long-term enhancements. If the AI applications were developed on infrastructure that could not be scaled-up, this may lead to limitations in the future for fine-tuning of model. 3-22 goal

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW 3.5. AI Governance AI governance refers to the practices and direction by which AI projects and applications are managed and controlled. The following are the important elements associated with the acceptance and success of developing and maintaining Al applications: Establishing governance structure to oversee the implementation of Al projects and AI Assessment Defining roles and responsibilities that affect the use and maintenance of the Ethical AI Framework. Please refer to Section 3.5.2.1 AI Governance Structure for details. Specifying a set of practices to and support organisations to plan, develop, deploy and monitor AI applications. Please refer to Section 4 ~AI Practice Guide"" for details. Assessing the adoption of those practices in terms of application impact: Please refer to Section 5 AI Assessment"" for details. Effective AI governance should not be a purely technology-led effort as it only solves for concerns that the technical stakeholders may have; it does nothing to assuage concerns posed by the public and requirements for end-to-end governance that integrates with the second and third lines of defence. The three lines of defence is a well-established governance concept in   many organisations.

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW approving Al applications. The Ethical Al Principles should be addressed through the use of AI Assessment before approval of the AI application. The third line of defence involves the IT Board, or the Chief Information Officer (""CIO ) if the IT Board is not in place, and is optionally supported by an Ethical AI Committee, which consists of external advisors. The purpose of the Ethical AI Committee is to provide advice on ethical Al and strengthen organisations existing competency on AI adoption. The third line of defence is responsible for reviewing, advising and monitoring ofhigh-risk AI applications. 3.5.2.1 AI Governance Structure The AI Governance Structure describes the activities for different roles/functions and defines their corresponding responsibilities Organisations make reference to the Ethical AI Framework to plan, implement, and maintain their AI applications The Project Team can be sourced from existing staff who are familiar with the organisations' business, IT project management and AL development process. The Project Team can involve System Analysts, System Architects and Data Scientists who execute the development of AImodels; manage deployment and post deployment performance. The size ofthe Project Team will depend on the organisational structure, operating model and scope of Al application being developed by the organisation. Roles and responsibilities for the Al Governance Structure are listed in the table below. Roles Responsibilities IT Board; or CIO The IT Board is   responsible for overseeing an organisation $ IT if the IT Board is applications, including AL applications and reviewing Al Application not in place Impact   Assessment (please  refer to Section 5 SAI Assessment"" for details) for high-risk Al applications before commencement of projects. The Terms of Reference (TOR"") for the IT Board outlines high-level responsibilities including steering the use of IT in the organisation, integrating the Information Strategy direction with the business objectives and ensuring that IT initiatives support the organisation'$ direction and policies. This can be achieved for AI projects through review of an AI Application impact assessment before project commencement. AI projects that trigger one of the risk gating criteria a8 mentioned in Section 51 AIApplication Impact Assessment and Appendix C %AI Application_Impact Assessment_Template ""  within an AI Application Impact Assessment are defined as high-risk AI applications and would require the IT Board's approval. The Project Manager is responsible for verification of answers to the risk gating criteria to determine if the AI 3-24 key Any

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW Roles Responsibilities application is ofhigh risk with support from the Project Team as needed. The definition of high-risk Al applications can be further refined by the IT Board as   the experience and AI capabilities of an organisation increases. The IT Board has the responsibilities to: Review AI Application   Impact Assessment   for high-risk AI applications. Review the recommendations and remediation actions provided by the Project Team based on the reviewed AI Application Impact Assessment and provide comments to the PSC/PAT and the Project Team to ensure appropriate considerations of risks, ethical aspects and benefits. Ethical AI The Ethical AT Committee is responsible for advising the IT Board/CIO Committee on ethical issues related to AI applications and AI Assessment: The (optional) Ethical AI Committee would mainly consist of external advisors with expertise in technical aspects (e:g: Data, AI Analytics), ethics, legal, risk/benefits assessment and security. Committee members  should be well versed in assessing ethical type issues for Al projects and be aware of the criteria for approving an Al project. For example: Risks are determined to be reasonable and have been mitigated in relation to the anticipated benefits that may reasonably be expected to result; Risks to the population  making up the data   subjects   (e.g: children; prisoners, educationally disadvantaged persons, mentally disabled; as well as other   vulnerable groups) are considered; The ethical (permissible) basis for the collection and use of the personal data are appropriately documented (e.g: it is within the scope of expected use, consent was obtained); There are adequate   provisions to   protect the privacy of individuals involved in the project; and The related AI Assessment and decisions reached by the Project Team and the IT Board/CIO.

Reviewers can include specialists in: Privacy; Data securitylinformation security; Engineering/technology/human factors  (i.e. the psychological and   physiological   principles to engineering   and   design of products, processes and systems); Data analytics/data science; Legal; Public relations; and General organisation expertiselknowledge of best practices An Ethical AI Committee can be used when project is sufficiently large,  high-impact and  high-profile that   its   ethical   values   may be challenged and therefore there is a need for an independent review. Organisations can assess this need based on the potential  negative impacts of AL applications when planning for Al application projects. The impact section of the AI Application Impact Assessment can be used to document this impact: The objective of the Ethical AI committee is to provide some measure of assurance that the activity is ethical, appropriate and defensible under public scrutiny. Examples of where an Ethical Al Committee could be used  include when AI is used for health care   services which have significant impacts o the of patients, substantial deployment of automated   personal identification   technologies is involved in the balance of personal freedom and control, or where substantial amounts of sensitive data (e:g: personal traits) are processed by or shared by AI even legally: It should be noted that compositions may vary depending on the needs from the specific organisation and the industry that the organisation relates to on a case-by-case basis.

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW 1. Project Strategy The Al and Data strategy for individual organisations should be formulated with alignment to its strategic and the Ethical Al Principles. Such strategy should be documented and effectively communicated within the organisations The key leadership roles accountable for the implementation of the integrated strategy and roles who have responsibility for execution should be formally assigned. Subsequently, comprehensive and effective process should be established to routinely monitor and analyse external changes in AI and data use expectations These   changes   should be analysed and used to routinely adopt the organisation 's strategy, policies and governance. Ethical Al Principles should be formally established, aligned with overall organisational strategy and effectively integrated into the   organisation's   policies,  procedures and governance framework: The   overall AI application   governance process includes a well-embedded assessment process to ensure all policies are effectively and the application should be evaluated against benefits, impacts and risks with respect to all stakeholders. 2. Project Planning defined AI portfolio management process should be established to ensure alignment around strategic business These are prioritised against short-term and long-term goals and include achieving a positive impact on society: Key governance processes should exist with executive responsibility and oversight to ensure risk and ethical based decisions on how the portfolio ofapplications is A defined project management structure should be in place to ensure the portfolio of AI applications can facilitate scaling and adoption: responsibilities should be established with board or senior level sponsorship. Management processes should be in place to ensure effective data governance throughout the AI portfolio. Clear processes should be in place to establish that all AI initiatives are assessed as to their negative impact 0 individuals, groups or society and are evaluated against a broad range of benefits and risks. Public expectations should be routinely evaluated for change. The assessment   process ensures auditability, including traceability and logging of the AI S processes and outcomes. senior level decision making bodylgroup should be formally established to address AI applications of higher risks 3.

Formalised responsibility and processes should be established to evaluate and ensure all related staff are equipped with the skills and knowledge need to take on the and responsibility for Al objectives The sourcing team  should be routinely evaluated and allocated the right expertise to perform the change management delivery, training and transition to business as usual. Third-party vendor tools, data and techniques should be evaluated to ensure alignment with Ethical AI Principles, data use and/or AI governance. 4. Project Development defined and programmatic  project  management plan and system, aligned with the organisation'$ ethical values, should be developed to address all required organisational processes, functional and non-functional requirements, business value alignment and risk and testing assessment as part of development process for all new AL initiatives. This includes formal integration to the enterprise master data management requirements. The integrated development of data, analytics/AI, automation/software with Ethical AI Principles should be embedded across all the organisational dimensions during design and development with appropriate validation and verification. AI application  and data   suitability should be  matched to the business  objectives and technology required. Where third-party data or technology is used, all required organisational process, risk and testing requirements should be formally assessed. Concurrently, requirements should be defined, and project management should incorporate strategy. Plans and/or systems, Or a set of procedures should exist to avoid creating Or reinforcing unfair bias in the AI system, both regarding the use of input data as well as for the algorithm design: Formalised processes should be established to test and monitor for potential biases during the development, deployment and operation of the AI application. The AI application   should be evaluated for  reliability, model  sensitivity and model performance against the formalised selected definition of fairness Bias   trade-offs   with   respect to performance,  trade-offs between   interpretability  and performance should be routinely evaluated. 5 System Deployment formalised process with assigned responsibility should be in place to ensure all the AI applications are assessed across all dimensions for   impact on all stakeholders at deployment: This   includes   assessing whether an appropriate  balance of benefits and 3-31 they goals

Best practices of Machine Learning ( ML"") Engineering, ML Operations ( MLOps"" Model Operations ( ModelOps"" Data Operations ( DataOps"") and Ethical AI Principles should be embedded across all dimensions of the organisation. A defined project management system should be established to assess and develop a comprehensible plan to roll out Al applications and management systems and processes should be in place to continuously identify, review and mitigate risks ofusing the identified AI applications post deployment: The project management system and process should ensure the project continues to add value to the services, benefits are measured, have been defined and are actively tracked and reported on. 6. System Operation and Monitoring defined systematic monitoring capability, including customer redress processes should be established to capture issues/incidents related to AI applications. An escalation process should be established to escalate significant issues/incidents related to AI applications to the IT BoardCIO for their awareness and action: Clear responsibilities and service level agreements should be defined for all Al application support groups coupled with continuous learning (both machine learning and human/organisational learning) which have been built to ensure integration with other processes such as security event management: The AI Lifecycle aligns with a traditional software lifecycle model as depicted in Figure 11.

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW In a typical development process of an AL application, great emphasis is placed on data because data are often required for creating a AI model. Data sourcing and preparation which is of the project development can be a continuous exercise. This is because an AI model can often benefit from better or more data for iterative model training throughout the development process. The approach of conventional software lifecycle is to program the IT application with a set of instructions for a pre-defined set of events. Thereafter; the IT application will exploit its computing capabilities and other resources to process the data fed into the system: This is different from an AI application where a huge amount of data are fed into the application, which in turn processes all the data resulting in a trained model o AL solution: This trained model is then used to solve new problems. There is often a continual feedback loop between the development and deployment stages, as well as system operation and monitoring of the AI Lifecycle for iterative improvements making this distinct from a traditional software development lifecycle. 3-33 good good part

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE 4. AI PRACTICE GUIDE Organisations can refer to this AI Practice Guide throughout various project stages of AI Lifecycle starting from planning, ecosystem, development; deployment and ongoing monitoring of AI applications. Organisations should continue to follow the related existing ordinances, policies, and guidelines for IT projects which are relevant to their respective business domain Or industry and current practices. Practices listed in the Al practice are additional, ethical AI related guidance that organisations are advised to adopt This section describes practices for organisations to consider and adopt as progress the AI Lifecycle when developing Al applications Organisations can follow the AI Practice Guide at an early stage when conducting the planning stage of the AI Lifecycle  for their projects. Gradually, they can   then use the AI Practice   Guide  for  other AI Lifecycle  areas based on organisational needs and progress with AI: The AI Practice Guide contains sections that require technical data and AI knowledge. The Project Team Manager should work with the Project Team to ensure that the appropriate data analysis has been done and evidenced in assessment. Training for Project Teams involved in Al is fundamental to ensure that these teams can achieve Al capabilities. Examples used in the AI Practice Guide are taken  from different sources and are purely for illustrative purposes only. They do not imply that the specific examples have to be followed by organisations.

Examples of components for an AI strategy include a vision, objectives, roadmap, and alignment of AI with organisation goals, Ethical AI Principles and considerations for governance. The governance roles, people and technology resources for deployment of AI applications constitute the Al governance. The AI strategy can be   documented standard   strategy document formats in line with existing organisational strategy documents. The timeframe for completion ofan Al strategy would be subject to the timeframe for planning and developing Al applications There is no set timeframe for the strategy and each organisation would complete this as they it for their AI plan  when following the Ethical AI Framework. AI strategy could be included in organisational IT plan. The committee or group forming and reviewing the strategy can have a diverse team including the public relations, risk, legal, technology, human resources and other teams as deemed necessary. Organisations should include the Ethical AI Principles in their AI strategy to ensure there is an awareness for all stakeholders and to show endorsement at an organisational level. If high-risk AI applications are anticipated to deploy, an IT Board/CIO review is required to the initiation and production deployment of the project: An Ethical AI Committee can be set up if external advisors are needed to enhance the competency of organisations in performing oversight/monitoring on high-risk Al applications Or use cases High-risk AI applications should be identified the risk gating criteria outlined in the AI Application Impact Assessment.

Gaps in process, people, systems   and data may be   considered when  formulating the organisational strategy. The AI strategy (including values and for the ethical use of AI) for the organisation  should have documented review including any considerations for the   organisation: One example of an AI strategy for an organisation would be having AI  transformation to   relieve manual workloads and increase the utilisation of AI skills and resources. considerations to achieve this should include the identification of areas which AI can be leveraged, the benefits of the AI application   towards end users, success   rates or other measurable of AI application adoption and  expected outcomes from the AI applications. A strategic assessment as of setting up the AI strategy (e.g: performance of SWOT analysis) can be performed as part of the IT planning process This can be performed by an organisational project team, IT team or via the use of external consultants The AI strategy should be well communicated (e.g:  through internal email) and understood across the organisation. Refer to Appendix D AI Strategy Template"" for an illustrative template. Organisations can use other formats and templates for their AI Form Organisations should complete the AI Application Impact organisational view Assessment process (please refer to Section 5 -AI Assessment"" on AI solutions for details) to identify, vet and resource new ideas supported by AI applications (e:g. facial recognition, video analytics) The AI application should be assessed to   identify the benefits to organisation and impacts on individuals or society: Negative impacts or risks which should include the sensitivity of information required, potential social discrimination towards people, impacts on the environment and   potential costs from a legal  perspective   should be identified. The strategy and priorities should be  aligned, with the benefits and risks considered. This should be standardised for identification and approval of use cases. The Project Team should periodically scrutinise the academic and  business   landscape to   identify  potential   applications or research of Al that can be to achieve business objectives.

Emphasise the need for interpretability and request documentation on this (e.g: algorithms specification, coding and techniques the AI model is based on and its outcomes _ for review of the AI models within AI applications. Doing so will enable the organisations to engage with other vendors in the future to continue or enhance the   initial AI application   rather than  being locked into one vendor; Where vendors will not release documentation on AI algorithms due to trade secrets in practice, there can be a business decision for the organisation to take on where the risk of such non- disclosure should be considered   with the   possible business consequences. Organisations   (using their individual   project governance bodies _ would consider case by case with their own justifications, considerations and decision documented: Ensure the data models and data formats for the AI application are usable across a variety of platforms, rather than formats that are specific  to a given   vendor where  possible. This can be checked with the individual vendors. Agree on Intellectual Property Some third-party vendors may not disclose the algorithm and technique  used in the   development of the AI application to protect their intellectual property (IP) rights. When the third- party vendor designs and develops a new Al application for the use of organisation, the new intellectual property owner should be mutually in   line with   organisation   procurement procedures.

A standard process exists to define and validate the performance and business success criteria for a given AL   project and application. Examples of these criteria include measuring performance metrics such as true positive rates o false negative rates or false positive rates for classification models. High true positive rates can indicate that the Al application performs as intended and provides results with high accuracy whereas high false positive rates denote that negative cases are incorrectly predicted as positive and the Al application may require further fine-tuning to produce accurate results High false negative rates denote that   positive cases are not  correctly included in the prediction result: Given there is no single set of metrics that can fit all AI applications (given higher false negative rates may trigger a lower false positive rate and vice versa), this definition should be tailored by Project Team for individual Al application: Organisations should engage both internal and external stakeholders to determine   the  functional  requirements, non- functional requirements and quality assurance procedures needed for the AI application: Organisations should consider  potential alternatives to the current or proposed Al applications and check the performance compared to the AI application in terms of accuracy metrics and any business, legal, economic Or social impacts For example, is the alternative method more accurate and economical from an operational  perspective   than an AI application?

Supervised learning is the process of training AL models using training datasets that contain an  input and a correct output which allow the model to learn. Examples of supervised learning algorithms are regression and anomaly detection. Unsupervised learning = Ifthe dataset does not have any corresponding output pair, then an unsupervised learning algorithm should be used. Unsupervised learning is a learning algorithm that  will attempt to identify the pattern and hidden  structures within the data. Examples ofunsupervised learning algorithms are clustering and dimension reduction: Reinforcement learning Reinforcement learning is a reward and punishment mechanism used to train AI models where the   reward function determines the rewards for the actions of the Al model and vice versa.

Considerations should include whether it would be generally acceptable to society when the  decision-making process is fully automated by an AI application. Organisations should determine the level of human intervention required  from the AI application: In  general, there are three different approaches when determining the appropriate level of human intervention: These are human-out-of-the-loop human-in-the-loop and human-in-command' . Human-in-the- loop = and *human-in-command' approaches can be considered assisted intelligence or augmented intelligence while human-out- of-the-loop can be considered automated intelligence or autonomous intelligence. The extent   of human intervention should be proportionate to the impact level associated with the AI application. A higher impact would have a higher level of human intervention expected. 1. Consider a human-out-of-the-loop   approach in decision- making when decisions being made do not have a significant impact on the economy, society, law or when it is impractical to involve human beings in the process. Impact assessment can be performed using the AI Application Impact Assessment.

An Extract, Transform and Load (ETL ) tool is typically used to extract huge volumes of data from various sources and to transform and load the data based on the Almodel's needs.

Enable error handling Develop an error handling mechanism for the ETL solution: The mechanism error handling mechanism should capture the ETL s task name, error number and error description. This should then be captured in a separate   table or file that  enables the Project Team to issues and fix them. For example, an alerting mechanism can be incorporated to alert Project Team members via email when errors in ETL processes occUI. Example: For video analytics, to obtain assurance for public Or third-party data, ensure that the videos have been obtained from valid source based on the metadata of the video and verify the recording location, recording dateltime, duration, etc. Additional analysis can be done on the video to ensure source validity by identifying whether the human being' $ faces have been altered due to adversarial attacks. This would assist adherence to the ~Reliability, Robustness and Security' principle. For adherence to the ~Reliability, Robustness and Security""' principle, organisations should enable the error handling mechanism: An AI model for counting footfall from CCTV should be tested actual video and re-tested when there are code changes.

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE 4.1.4.4 Pre-processing Definition: In the data processing procedures for AL modelling purposes, the data processed need to be fair and appropriate in terms of data samples, Size and distributions to ensure the AI application formulate meaningful and representative inferences. Representational flaws in datasets such as overrepresentation o underrepresentation of data samples may lead to bias in the outcomes of trained AI models. Sensitive data containing an individual S information   requires extra care during solution development to prevent data leakage as well as breaches of privacy and security policies  The amount of personal data collected, processed and used should be minimised where feasible.

Data anonymisation is the process ofprotecting sensitive information via encrypting; masking and aggregating any information that links an individual to the stored data. Reaffirm that the benefits of keeping anonymised data outweigh the potential risk that such data are used to identify individuals, and the impact that such de-identification could have on the individuals. For this reason, the Project Team should review regularly  whether   anonymised data can be   re-identified and adopt appropriate measures to protect personal data. similar analysis on benefits and risks should be applied to assess the loss of data utility if the data are being de-identified. For example, blurring faces in video analytics is a form of data anonymisation performed to reduce class bias and protect the identities of the individuals. When data anonymisation is performed, document the process to achieve this as part of the logging procedures. 4-26

Organisations should identify if there are any less data-intensive methods to achieve the of the activity. Data minimisation involves identifying the minimum amount of data needed to fulfil the  purpose and objective of the AI application. Project Teams can achieve minimised data by ensuring the data collected is: sufficient to meet the objective; relevant and has a rational  connection to achieve the objective; and limited to only what is required. For   example, data aggregation, a process of   collating and summarising the data can be performed to reduce the level of detail if it is not required: Create a single Process and analyse sensitive data in one secure work area within analytical data the same server or cloud   environment where   the data was environment collected to avoid the risk of leakage when transferring the data: Additionally, the   organisation should avoid ad-hoc insecure environments where possible to ensure proper handling of data is maintained throughout the project lifecycle. Implement  and adhere to retention policies  for all data (e:g: personal data and video data) collected. Identify outliers and Detect outliers in the source dataset and in the final modelling anomalies datasets by plotting the data in the form of graphs such as box plots, scatter plots or histograms Outliers and anomalies can be defined as data points in the dataset being some distance away from the mean of the dataset' $ population. If the detected outliers and anomalies in the dataset involve errors or do not represent the population accurately, should be removed or patched with reasonable values   if do not   represent the entire population accurately: This is because, in supervised learning AI models, outliers and anomalies can be deceiving, resulting in prolonged training times, or leading to less precise AI models. When the datasets contain a large number of variables, identifying and removing outliers can be challenging: In such cases, automatic outlier detection algorithms can be used in the modelling   pipeline. Examples   of automatic outlier   detection 4-27 goals using they they

Organisation   should define fairness in the context of their AI application to be able to test for bias and fairness. As an example, facial recognition system should display statistical (equal) parity in order to classify people from different races accurately. Examples of mathematical fairness definitions are as follows: 1. Statistical (Equal) Parity Positive classification rates across both groups should be equal:. 2 Equal   Opportunity Mathematically, it   implies True Positive Rates across all groups should be equal: 3 Overall Accuracy Equality Both groups should give similar accuracy measures for the given model: 4 Gini Equality Gini is defined as the ratio area between the Receiver  Operating Characteristic (ROC ) curve and the diagonal line as well as the area of a related triangle. In essence, the model should do an equally task of classifying 1's as 1's and 0's as 0's across all groups. Bias can encroach upon an AI application when bias exists in data being used to train the AI model. Organisations can mitigate inherent bias using bias detection methods to evaluate whether the model discriminates against various groups O individuals, given a test-dataset. Examples ofbias detection methods include: Comparing performance metrics Analyse performance of the AI model across groups, by calculating different rates of correct and incorrect   predictions Different performance   metrics   such as true   positive rate, false positive rate, true negative rate or false negative rate for each possible group in the dataset are then computed Output such as distribution plots of features can identify skewness across groups. Measuring fairness This can be done by performing comparison analysis for the disadvantaged against advantaged groups based on fairness definitions normalised treatment quality, statistical parity, etc. Bar charts and heat maps are examples of outputs that could capture disparities across groups. Detecting proxies This can be done by calculating mutual information of all features with different sensitive attributes (e.g: age, gender and race) to understand how might act as proxies. Fix unbalanced class Unbalanced classes are a classification issue that arises when the problems distribution of data across different classes is biased.

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practice Practice detail model. This means that not all the classes or categories in the dataset are represented equally. AI predictive modelling involves predicting a class label for a given observation from the datasets. When an unbalanced class complication appears, this results in AI models that show poor predictive performance, specifically for the classes from minority groups,   resulting in class discrimination. Benchmark data distributions against the full dataset population statistics to quantify the representativeness of the data being tested. This can assist in mitigating bias in the data used for model development. For example, use standard algorithms such as random forest; logistic   regression and decision trees to ensure classification model that can predict classes with limited instances   and ensures   that training data contains  equal data samples from different groups. In the event  where unbalanced datasets led to the unbalanced class issue, this could be handled using sampling techniques such as: random resampling to rebalance the class distribution for the imbalanced dataset; random under-sampling to delete dataset examples from the majority class with the intention that the model loses some information to achieve a balanced dataset comparable to the minority class; and random oversampling to duplicate dataset examples from the minority class to achieve a balanced dataset comparable to the majority class. Compare training; Once the AI model has been tuned to a satisfactory level, a validation and test testing dataset can be used to evaluate the learned models to data gauge the model'$ performance 0n unseen data. Training data are the sample data used to train the AI model: If several models or tuning ofhyper-parameters are involved, validation data can be used to evaluate the model fit among different models during model development. Test data can be considered the data that will be held   from the AI model for   final  modelling purpose until the very end of the training stage. The benchmark for the data size is as follows: Training data: test data: validation data are commonly set at 60.20.20 or 70:15.15. If validation data are not used, Hyperparameter refers to a parameter which its value is used to control the learning process of a machine learning model. For example the maximum level for a random forest model. 4-29 good testing

Analyse and compare both training and validation/test data to ensure the results from what is used to evaluate AI model are equivalent to what was   used to build the  model. This is to confirm that the outcome of the AI model is comparable when new and unseen test data are used. For example, if the AI model is able to classify an image of a person as a human being; based on the training data, it should be able to perform comparably based on the test data even though both images presented are two distinct individuals. Create or use a library containing training and validation/test data which can be utilised to evaluate for potential unintended bias. For example, some Python deep learning libraries? 21 22 can be used t0 detect prejudicial or discriminatory correlations between features, labels and groups. Example: One example to practice data anonymisation in the case of video analytics is to blur or obscure faces to ensure individuals cannot be identified in the videos (when identification is not necessary) This is in line with the Data Privacy"" principle. If the objective of the analytics is to measure footfall, limit the data extraction and storage to the total count: Consider blurring of faces at the point of data collection and do not extract information such as the behaviour of individuals and their activities. To adhere to the ""Fairness"" principle, organisations can analyse the training data used to assess fair representation. For video analytics (to measure footfall), ensure that the AImodel measures footfall correctly for different groups of people. Training data can contain equal data samples from individuals in different groups to ensure different types of individuals are recognised. Training data, when used to measure footfall via CCTV should include various scenarios to ensure the outcome of the model meets the objective correctly: Related Ethical AI Principles: L.

Examples of  testing include algorithm testing and regression testing: Lack of documentation or logging of model results and configurations can make it difficult to manage Or maintain AI assets in subsequent stages The should contain information such as: Jobs/operations performed by the AL application including the algorithm(s) executed; and Decisions made and outcomes.

The Project Team should incorporate downside risk measures in machine learning objective   functions to operate more conservatively to  avoid situations in which the AI makes disastrous decisions. For example, if the Almodel does not meet the success criteria, other measures should be performed by the AL model that can include escalating to a human operator O aborting the decision-making process_ Example: Reinforcement learning can be used for autonomous vehicles. For example, when AL moves the vehicles in a certain direction, the pattern of the traffic surrounding the vehicles can be used as a reward function (i.e. if the surrounding vehicles are greater than a specified distance away from the autonomous vehicle itself and in line with the highway it is more likely that the decisions being made by the AI are correct). Scenarios should be checked to ensure that traffic patterns recognised are safe for others This adheres to the ""Reliability, Robustness and Security' principle. Related Ethical AI Principles: 1.

A robust AL model relies on these informative inputs to provide an output; often referred to as target  variable (i.e. what the AI model is trying to predict) Selections of   input variables should consider both   organisation knowledge and causal relationships.

Avoid target variable The Project Team should avoid target variable leakage which is leakage where information that should be beyond the training dataset is used to create the AI model. Target variable leakage arises when the AI model is being trained based on a dataset that includes information that would not normally be available at the time of prediction: This future  information can make the AI model  s results appear more accurate than the model performance would be in real situations. Time-series data (ifused) should be evaluated if data are not used where the data occurred after the case predicted by the AI model. A cut-off value on time can be useful to prevent obtaining information after the time of prediction: Features that are highly correlated with the input variable should be assessed to ensure are not a result of future information (as these features are more likely to be the target variable leakage ifit is occurring). Example: Organisations should aim to avoid target variable leakage to adhere to the ""Fairness' principle. When AI is used in medical diagnosis to detect disease, the training dataset should be limited to data that would be available at the time of prediction: If it has data such as future surgery used, this may indicate that the real results of the model are not as as expected. Related Ethical AI Principles: 1. Fairness Data used in AI models should be obtained fairly. 2_ Reliability, Robustness and Security To operate reliably and as expected, avoiding target variable leakage means that test results for predictions are more likely to mirror accuracy levels of real predictions. 4-34 prior being they good

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE 4.1.4.5.4 Model Overfitting Definition: Overfitting is a modelling error that emerges when an Al model is trained to closely fit a limited set of data points. An overfitting model will often exhibit high accuracy on the training dataset but low accuracy on new data. If the Al model does not generalise well from the training data to new or unseen data, the AI model may perform poorly in its prediction. Who are involved at this stage? Data Scientists Practices and examples: Practice Practice detail Perform cross - Cross-validation is a resampling  procedure that would be validation performed by a development team to evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy ofan Al model based on a limited data sample. One example of a resampling procedure is the k-fold technique. The K-fold technique allows training and testing of the Amodel k-times on different subsets of training data to derive a more accurate estimate of the model S prediction performance Every resampled dataset should have a similar distribution as the full population's distribution for this approach to be acceptable. For example, if the full population consists   of 10 distinct categories,  the resampled dataset   should have a comparable number of distinct categories This is because missing categories during the cross-validation process can lead to bias in the AI model's outcome. Perform Consider the use of regularisation. Regularisation is the process regularisation and to normalise and bring uniformity to Al models Regularisation other forms of model is often a technique used in machine learning to fine-tune the Al selection model  function by discouraging the learning of additional and unnecessary   complex models. This can reduce the risk of overfitting: An example of a regularisation technique is pruning: This can be used to remove features that are the least important for the model to learn from. AI models can learn not oly basic features of provided datasets but also noise as well as fluctuations that place importance on unimportant features and hence pruning can help. Examples of unimportant features can include backgrounds in an image containing the actual object being detected. 4-35

Page 86:

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practice Practice detail Example: To avoid overfitting in the case of medical diagnosis, cross-validation can be performed. AI models can be further evaluated by splitting sample data by specific medical conditions and re-evaluating the model's diagnosis Another method to avoid overfitting is reducing factors unrelated to the condition (e.g: social background or location in some cases to reduce the complexity of the AI model). Such practices would assist organisations to adhere to the ~Reliability, Robustness and Security"" principle. Related Ethical AI Principles: 1. Reliability, Robustness and Security Overfitting should be avoided to ensure outcomes from AI models when used on unseen data are reliable and accurate. 4.1.4.5.5 Model Training Ownership Definition: Al models where the training process is partially or fully outsourced to the public cloud Or relies on third-party pre-trained models can introduce new security risks. Please note that if the Al model training process is not outsourced, the practices and examples in this subsection are not applicable. Who are involved at this stage? Sourcing Team (i.e. Procurement). 4-36

Page 87:

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practices and examples: Practice Practice detail Use trusted The process of training an AI model involves providing the AI cloud/third-party model with training data to learn from. Precise training data are services required to help AI models to understand patterns to derive conclusion: third-party vendor used to train an Al model or to provide a cloud training environment for the organisation should be subject to the third-party procurement process. This helps lower the risk of receiving tampered model that may feature a backdoor. Please refer to Section 4.1.3.2 ~Procuring AI Services  for details on third-party procurement process. Organisations should assess the suitability of storing and using personal data o data belonging to organisations on the public cloud. The trained model should be transferred only through channels that   provide   surety of integrity in transit:   Examples   include docker containers and pickle files (for python scripts) which can then be encrypted before being transferred. Example: When uSing cloud/third-party services, validate that cloud vendor is compliant with international security standards such as ISO and organisational security practices Compliance with international standards can help to ensure that Ethical AI Principles such as ""Data Privacy and *Reliability, Robustness and Security"" are followed: Related Ethical AI Principles: 1.

Such attacks can occur in the training phase O the test phase. Attacks that appear during the training phase are known as poisoning attacks whereas attacks that exist in the test phase can be identified as evasion attacks Who are involved at this stage?

Page 88:

ETHICAL AI FRAMEWORK AI PRACTICE GUIDE Practices and examples: Practice Practice detail Perform adversarial The Project Team should obtain as many adversarial examples training as possible and explicitly train the model not to be misled by these samples. Adversarial   training involves   enlarging the dataset to   include adversarial examples from which the AI models   can learn from. Adversarial  training is introduced to secure the AI application from   disruptive  perturbations at different  points   of vulnerability in an AI model. Disruptive perturbations happen  when a small random value is added to existing data points in training data that alter the original features of the data  Such examples can often be seen in digital images where random  values are added to the original image which results in the wrong classification by the Al model (e.g: an image ofapanda is classified as gibbon due to disruptive perturbations). Build a new adversarial machine learning model that predicts whether a dataset is from a recent dataset or from the AI training dataset  This could be a method to identify new changing data, leading to new forms of adversarial attacks that would require retraining of the AI model: For example, there are open-source libraries written in Python programming   language such as the Adversarial Robustness Toolbox2 that can be used to train A models against adversarial attacks. Perform dimension Use dimensionality reduction on the training data to enhance the reduction resilience of a classifier as a defence mechanism against evasion attacks. This means there are fewer data dimensions that can be used to falsify data. Dimensionality reduction refers to techniques that reduce the attributes of the data but still retain the meaningful  properties of the  original data. As an example, personal data attributes can include age, height; weight and race. Checking the missing values ratio is a method to reduce the dimensionality in data. Data fields with numerous empty O null values are less likely to carry useful information. Therefore, data fields with the number of empty values greater than a certain threshold could be removed. The higher the threshold set; the more data reduction will be performed.

End-users   (non-technical   experts)   should be involved in the testing process to ensure the AI application makes meaningful decisions for the organisations and provides better user interactions. Standardised testing benchmarks or metrics for   comparing candidate  models or evaluating readiness   for deployment can assist in selecting the optimal AI application: Please refer to Section 4.1.6.1 'Data and Model Performance Monitoring"" for examples of performance metrics Stakeholders   including the Project Team, business users and governance functions should review testing results and provide approval for AI assets to deployment into the production environment. This includes   assessing the AI application ' S suitability for the objective of the organisation and that there is a process in place to produce reasons for the decisions or recommendations from the AL application when requested Enable edge cases The Project Team should consider using cases to train the and exception AI model on how it should respond when encountering handling cases. Edge cases typically occur when an AI application encounters   unexpected scenarios where it may not perform as expected. AI models should be   developed and  incorporated to handle unseen data, new use cases and potential malicious inputs. As an example of edge cases, when AI to measure footfall from videos, different examples should be verified (e.g: when a person is using an object such as a bike or a person is wearing a mask). Precautions should be taken to ensure that these situations are handled correctly: Estimate the impact of your AI application when it provides inaccurate results and identify ways to minimise it For example, if the AI application   produces erroneous  results, what is the likelihood that it causes harm to users? Increased human intervention can support to minimise the impact of the erroneous results.

This can assist in earlier detection of errors to stop these errors affecting other parts of the Al application: For high- risk AL applications, drills should be performed to ensure that everyone is conscious of procedures to handle different stop system errors or failures appropriately. The Project Team should incorporate defense or controls at the beginning or end of each solution step to prevent flow-on effects that could cause a significant system failure. For example, when data are pre-processed, the processing could when there are errors and a warning to users_ Consider controls in place that allow for human intervention or auto-shutdown in the event  of system failure and create a business continuity plan to address such undesirable events. The plan should include the response and recovery methods in the event of system failure. Organisations should also consider the business continuity plan, which identifies what are the processes to be taken when the model fails, needs to be taken offline, or decommissioned. The decommissioning could be because the model no longer works, is no longer relevant; or a newer and better system has been created to take its place. The business continuity plan ensures there is no impact on a process or function during the transition process. For some systems, this may include a parallel run while a new system is coming online before the old Al application is taken offline.

This is to avoid alteration of data and audit trails should be retained based on applicable retention periods. Consider establishing a traceability mechanism for the entire data pipeline to enforce accountability and allow tracking of data manipulation activities. An AI application is traceable when its decisions, datasets and processes or algorithm;, evaluation parameters, outcomes and error logs are documented and tracked Ensure the AI application's   logs  and records (for   example, timestamps ofany scheduling tasks, count of data rOws, the users involved and modelling interactions) are generated and stored securely.

Examples of metrics such as precision, recall, F-score or accuracy can be calculated to measure the AI model s performance. This includes checking 0n the success of predictions and the level of inaccuracy that the predictions have to ascertain that the AI model is still  performing in an acceptable manner. Refer to examples of bias in data in Section 4.1.4.3 'Data Extraction"" . Organisations should define AI model indicators to assess whether the AI models are operating as designed to continuously meet their intended Incorporate quality Documenting assumptions (on expected inputs, value assessments distributions and boundaries) and integrating them into the AI model can help affected instances which could prevent full execution of the AI model and instances that could result in poor predictions. Independent   validation should be   defined and be   performed periodically by the PSC/PAT according to the risk of AI models Organisations should periodically assess the AI model indicators to determine whether their AI models are operating as designed. As AI technologies are developing, new risks will be introduced; and having a process to continually identify, review and mitigate new risks post   deployment will contribute to the reliability, robustness and security of the AI application. Quality  assessments should serve as detection and  response mechanisms for undesirable adverse effects of the AI application for the end-user or subject (for example, if an AI model is not performing as intended, this should be detected and resolved by retuning the model) Create anomaly The Project Team should create, implement and monitor anomaly detection techniques detection   techniques Anomaly  detection  refers to identifying outliers or exceptions where the   patterns deviate from the expected behaviour within the dataset: It is useful in identifying outliers that significantly deviate from the rest of the data and is a useful technique that can be used to prevent adversarial inputs.

The AI Application Impact Assessment process includes the identification and analysis of: Processes related to the AI application and Ethical AI Principles that align with the AI Practice Guide requirements; Benefits that the AI application will bring; Negative impacts on specific stakeholders; and Establishment of required controls and compliance/monitoring processes The benefits of performing an AI Application Impact Assessment are to enable better risk mitigation decisions that maximise benefits (through discussions on identified benefits, risks and impacts); provide a balanced view of existing Al application risks; and increase the organisations ability to reassure stakeholders on how Al application impact is managed. The AI Application Impact Assessment template is used to both document and record how an AI application has met the requirements outlined in the AI Practice Guide internal requirements and to facilitate the review and approval process with the considerations made on the approval decision. The AI Application Impact Assessment template is also used to evaluate the risk that an application poses and assist organisations to map and develop specific governance requirements to mitigate those risks.

The Ethical AI Framework provides structure and best practices across the stages of AI Lifecycle. The practices are aligned with the AI Application Assessment: By virtue of completing the AI Application Impact Assessment, gaps in various processes in the Al Lifecycle can be identified. As mentioned above, the AI Assessment help identifying the gaps in an organisation's roadmap of adoption and operationalisation of Al and provide guidance for establishing quality processes that can organisations to harness the power of AI in a responsible and ethical manner: final  approval o the go or no-go decision  for AL deployment should be provided by the PSCIPAT (with endorsement by the IT Board/CIO as appropriate) based on the consideration of having an appropriate balance of benefits and mitigated risks that the Al applications pose. 5-7 guide

Foreword The world is entering a new era of transformation, the 4th Industrial Revolution, and artificial intelligence(AI) is at the center of this revolution: AI, which only existed in the imagination in the past, is rapidly growing based on the development of ICTs such as the increase of computing power; data accumulation, and network advancement such as 5G. AI has started to be used and spread through all industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, transportation, environment; and education, and we can now easily encounter it in almost aspect of our daily lives. Artificial intelligence, with its cognitive, learning, and reasoning abilities, is expected to assist or replace human intellectual functions in the future, in the same way as machines such as steam engines substituted human physical labor in the age of industrialization. AI will create new added value by catalyzing innovation throughout the industries, provide people with greater convenience in their daily lives, and will also be powerful way to resolve social problems such as population aging and crime prevention: In the Al era, AI fundamentally changes the way of working and the job structure, while proliferation of Al could present dysfunction and security threats Therefore, rather than accepting these changes passively, we should be active change agents in creating a brighter future. I think it is time for us to prepare for a world where people and artificial intelligence can coexist. For this, in December last year; the government adopted a government-wide National for Artificial Intelligence under the vision of Toward AI World Leader beyond IT"" in an effort to give to the ""Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence (Oct. 2019)"" announced by President Moon Jae-in: The strategy focused on maximizing our national strengths such as the worlds best ICT infrastructure and semiconductor and manufacturing technology while realizing people-centered artificial intelligence with consideration and respect for people; beyond technical and industrial viewpoints If the public and private sectors work together to successfully implement this national strategy we can secure world-class digital competitiveness and significantly improve the quality of life for people by 2030. We are standing at an important crossroads where the of our future generations are at stake: In the meantime; we have to enhance our nations capacities to raise our status as the worlds top-10 economy and to enable to enjoy a more affluent and happier life. In the era of AI that harmonizes with innovation and engagement, would welcome your active interest and participation in opening a new AL era for the Republic of Korea_ Minister; Ministry of Science and ICT Choi Kiyoung National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence huge every Strategy shape lives people future

National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence What is the prospect for Al? Changes caused by Al The world in which we are living faces huge civilizational change through the 4th Industrial Revolution that we have never experienced before. At the center of this change is artificial intelligence (AI), which performs human intellectual functions as machinery replaced human physical labor in the past industrialization process: Industrialization AI Human Replaced by Human intellectual Replaced physical labor machinery labor by AI By engaging in intellectual activities of human beings with a computer; Al has developed the ability to perceive situations, to make rational and logical judgments and take actions, and to conduct emotional and creative functions, which are regarded to be owned only by humans: As a result, Al is expected to bring about a paradigm shift in all areas, including the humanities and societies, beyond mere technical dimensions. Many experts are presenting diverse opinions that our society can be transformed into utopia or dystopia. More importantly; experts share a common perception that we have to be thoroughly prepared for the huge wave of the 4th Industrial Revolution.

Foreword Artificial intelligence is ubiquitous in science; technology, and innovation development; especially in the current context of the Industrial Revolution 4.0. The foundation of science in inspiring natural behavior; together with an enormous amount of available data, is leveraging the potential of artificial intelligence to be more and more powerful in the context of management; planning, competition, and innovation. As a senior minister and minister of industry, science, technology, and innovation, am delighted to value this important document entitled ""Artificial Intelligence Landscape in Cambodia: Current Status and Future Trends, contributed by outstanding scholars. In my other capacity as Chairman of the National Council of Science; Technology; and Innovation; this document complements the respective mandates of science, technology; and innovation action in general and line ministries in particular We all know that technology will be alongside uS, especially in the development of the private sector, including industry; small and medium enterprises, and potable water Harnessing technology in these sectors is very relevant in the current landscape of socioeconomic endeavor in the Kingdom of Cambodia The contribution of the authors to this document is timely and triggers the readiness of STI actors to be more proactive and dynamic in this important evaluation of technologies. Technical advancement;,  particularly artificial intelligence, is an undeniable fact that all of US should take for granted as changes for a better human civilization: In principle, the overarching role of science, technology; and  innovation has remained with us for thousands of years. Technology development must be inclusive. However; we shall stay updated with the changes by harnessing critical technologies for social good. This reminds me of the priceless inheritance message not the strongest of the species that survive; nor the most intelligent; but the one most responsive to change_by Charles Robert Darwin; who is one of the greatest scientists of all time On top of this quote from the father of evaluation, am convinced that all of us, including government institutions, the private sector; and academia, shall be living with changes to survive, especially in the context of technological abruption. It is known that artificial intelligence is going to be with US more. However, feeding correct and sufficient data is our endless endeavor and critical from a technical point ofview. On the other hand, am also eager to take in overseeing the development of technologies from a policy of view. ""Al Landscape in Cambodia: Current Status and Future Trends"" is the first scholarly document to grasp the state of the art and the future of this technology in Cambodia. strongly encourage policymakers, the private sector, and academia to materialize this useful document for their respective missions. am firmly convinced that the discussion provided in the report is a strong foundation for the development of your institution in particular and Cambodia in general: part point

Executive Summary Over six decades, the evolutionary development of Al has been astonishing and proves its capability  through   simple neural networks, multi-level text   analytics, deep learning,  image analytics, self-adaptive and natural language processing breakthroughs, neuromorphic technology, and the edge of human consciousness   system development: Al has been implemented and adopted in business sectors for a variety of purposes in manufacturing; health care, retail, banking, and public services The rapid development of Al calls out key areas that need to be addressed in any future policy or law governing the use of Al, such as privacy, accountability,  safety, and security; transparency and explainability; fairness and non- discrimination; human control of technology; professional responsibility; and promotion of human values. Firms and organizations across all sectors strive to maximize the potential of their data to make better decisions for commercial and social purposes: From a technical perspective , there are several types of Al applications, such as machine learning, deep learning, hybrid learning; and digital twins: Some of the industries seen as benefiting from Al in Cambodia are healthcare, education, and finance. For healthcare, Al can be used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnoses and identify potential health risks and preventative measures For example, Al can analyze medical images and identify abnormalities such as tumors or other potential health issues. In addition; Al can be used in education in Cambodia to improve the quality and accessibility of education. Another area where Al is beginning to have an impact in Cambodia is finance. Al is being used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of financial transactions and identify potential fraud and money laundering: Overall; the development and adoption of Al in Cambodia is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to transform many aspects of society. The key challenges and opportunities in this area include the need for specialized skills and expertise, as well as the need to address ethical and privacy concerns. With continued investment and development; Al has the potential to greatly benefit Cambodia in the coming years. Strategically, R&D is essential to cope with the Al-enabled advancements in the world: With billions of dollars expected to be generated from Al globally, Cambodia sees the need and urgency to invest, adapt, and prepare for this Al global force in line with the industry 4.0 trend as the economy increasingly becomes knowledge- and digital-based. There are many challenges and concerns that come with the use of Al. Certainly, machine learning requires massive amounts of data and computing time. Researchers are generally challenged when it comes to finding high-quality, unbiased training sets to teach Al. In many cases, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of records, are required to properly implement deep learning algorithms. And data sets containing biased information can lead to undesirable results. There are other cultural challenges to consider that branch out into new issues for leadership. vii

when it comes to incorporating Al. Also, there has been much written about how Al will take jobs away from unskilled or easily automated workers: In Cambodia, this technology is not just about Al. It is about creating a digital framework within the existing infrastructure to implement its learning capability alongside the work of information and communication technology. relevant legal framework on data and cybersecurity is also needed to be in force to combat cybercrimes and provide assurance to relevant businesses, practitioners, and consumers in the field. Infrastructure is the and there is already a basic technological foundation that Cambodia has been building for years that will be leveraged to maximize the impact of Al: Last but not least, Al is one of the essential technologies in the world that is game-changing in every   sector to improve   productivity,  efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. In order to foster trustworthy Al ecosystems, it is essential for countries to develop human-centered policies that promote socio-economic and responsible Al research and development. This includes policies that encourage investment in such initiatives. These policies for Al development should take into account its national development vision as well as regional and global trends: The country's objectives, preferences, and overarching strategy for Al advancement in the immediate and distant future should be clarified. Initially, the main objective is to cultivate skilled personnel and employ Al solutions to deal with critical national focus areas that will have a swift impact on Cambodia's socio-economic status. Over time, the priority should shift to developing fundamental and advanced research, promoting high-level Al research and innovation; and establishing Cambodia's standing in advanced technology on a global: viii key,

1_ The Boundless Potential of Al: Adoption and regulations 1.1. Trend-Megatrends The fast-moving trend of Artificial Intelligence (Al) has gained its impetus to fundamentally change the business and economy landscape and society for the last few years The term Artificial Intelligence (Al) was first coined in 1956 to broadly address the machine simulation of intelligence where the machine can simulate every aspect of learning and feature of intelligence (Lau & Haugh, 2018). Over six decades, the evolutionary development of Al is astonishing and proofs its capability from simple neural networks, multi-level text analytics, deep learning; image analytics, self-adaptive and natural language processing breakthrough, neuromorphic technology, and the edge of human consciousness system development: At this new stage of Al commercialisation; the ecosystem of industries is   disrupted and expectedly   forcibly transformed into digital and technological capability at various layers (Deloitte, 2019); firstly, the enterprise with maturity in Al application and capable resources will use Al in both management and production processes to foresee, with the use of data-mining, the global megatrend and the ability of their products and services to be commercialised. This enterprise change will cover sales, security, anti-fraud, human resource management; marketing, personal assistant; and smart tools: The second layer of industry change is expected to optimise the relationship between   upstream and downstream sectors on the traditional   industry chain where the consumer can access the product features directly. This industry change will take its course in finance, healthcare, education, retail, manufacturing, media, agriculture, and logistics, to name a Lastly, the future labor structure of enterprises will be transformed with virtual and augmented realities, gesture recognition, and robots to increase productivity and competitiveness: The embrace of Al among ASEAN member states (AMS) , of which 83% of ASEAN is at the early stages, and 15% of ASEAN is at advanced stages, is still at the nascent stages given the differences in the national priority, strategic investment, piloting initiatives within discrete activities, scaling initiatives, and end-to-end scaled implementation of Al (Chua and Dobberstein, 2020). The potential of Al contribution to the region's Growth Domestic Product (GDP) is forecasted to be approximately USS trillion, accounted for about 10 to 18% of DGP uplift across AMS in 2030. Nevertheless; the impact variance will be varied from one AMS to another based on the country's maturity in terms of Al infrastructure and adoption readiness; for instance, Cambodia, at the early stage of Al adoption, focuses more on the primary sectors (Chua and Dobberstein, 2020)- The top five sectors which will benefit from Al include (1) manufacturing; (2) retail and hospitality, (3) agriculture, (4) government, safetylsecurity, and smartcities, (5) healthcare. With Industry 4.0 technologies; Al could further advance the entire value chain, from product engineering and supply chain management to logistics and circular management: While having a dynamic and few:

Page 17:

mobile-centric population, the ASEAN region will boost retail and hospitality with machine learning and big data advancement. For the agricultural sector; drone and image recognition technologies will contribute to the prevention of crop diseases, pesticide and fertiliser application, and post- harvest management: Amid the complexity of challenges pertaining to the public sectors, Al will play essential role in resources' optimisation, traffic   congestion relief; education; and healthcare such as the accessibility to healthcare service, tracking, and management of infectious diseases. Al is no longer the futuristic term in Cambodia as the Al community is exponentially growing while Al technologies have become a reality and used in various sectors. Early Al community is seen in http:Ilcambodia.ail , i.e. an open-source algorithms community to develop Al skills in Cambodia, initiated by a regional start-up, WWWslash co. One such Al application is the flood detection system, managed by People In Need,; to potentially identify ""false positive"" alarms and predict flood risk among other projects: identity match, fraud detection, smart city, Khmer Chatbot;, eKYC[Know Your Customer] system, and Al for Real Estate business. Another deployment of Al is the Demine Robotics with the three key functions: (1) detect; (2) retrieve, and (3) destroy and the uniqueness of this robot is its small size, strength, intelligence , machine efficiency, machine sensitivity, and data collection: Other Al  prototypes include SCARA Robot, 4DOF Robot Manipulator; Dual Axis Solar Tracker; Drone (Hexacopter) , and Mobile Robot using Omni Wheel, at   Intelligent Mechatronics   Laboratory, Institute of   Technology of Cambodia: Universities including the National Institute of Posts, Telecommunications and ICT with new name as Cambodia Academy of Digital Technology, the American University of Phnom Penh, Kirirom Institute of Technology, and the Institute of Technology of Cambodia offer courses in Al, which will nurture the local talent. While constrained by the lockdown and health-safety measures, the early transformation of the soft and hard infrastructure of business could be seen across Cambodia: The earliest is the dine-in restaurant; where the service is turned to only takeaway and delivery. The drive-through and curbside restaurant and stores become relianton the pre-order and delivery App. The school is closed, and the physical classroom becomes online. Digital platforms and services viz Foodpanda, Nham24, BLOC, Cambodia AEON Online, become overnight popular. As such; Al integration will be potential for business in Cambodia. 1.22. Need Al adoption Artificial Intelligence has the capability to simulate intelligent, human-like behavior in computers, high speed with cutting-age technology, where the applications of Al are enormous including finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, education, agriculture, transportation, law, etc. There are various forms of Al, such as Machine learning; Expert Systems, Robotics, Neural Networks, Fuzzy Logic, and Natural Language Processing: For instance, machine learning in which machines could encompass neural networks and deep learning; like our human brains, can observe, analyse, and 2 an

Page 18:

learn from facts and errors rather than being told what to believe: This technology has an impact on consumer items and has resulted in important discoveries in healthcare and physics, as well as changes in industries as diverse as manufacturing, banking, and retail. Over time , machine learning algorithms increase their performance by learning from data. In this way, computers can adapt to conditions that are unforeseen and cannot be codified by static rules. Driving a car and chatting with a customer are examples of such jobs. On rare occasions, the computer may even come up with a solution that no human has ever thought of (Marr, 2021; Smart Nation Digital Government Office, 2019). For instance, Al has been implemented and adopted in industry for a variety of purposes, including (Marr , 2021; SAS Institute Inc-, 2023): Manufacturing: Al can be used to optimise areas of production such as yield, energy or throughput optimisation, assembly, and quality testing during the manufacturing process Heath Care: A personal health care assistant will be able to help with daily tasks (medicine, exercise, diet; detect the patient illness symptom) and to predict chronic disease Retail: Consumers may do virtual shopping, receive tailored suggestions, and discuss their purchasing alternatives. With the help of Al, the business will grow faster Banking: Al improves speed, precision , effectiveness of human error with ability to detect the fraudulent of unusual transactions, etc Public Sector: Make smart cities smarter, support the national defense, enhance effectiveness of the public services, etc. The application of Al is limitless: It will always depend on its purpose, ie. who and where should Al be adopted, must be carefully determined: 13. Alignment to Vision Artificial intelligence's progress and spread provide new and significant problems for technologists, humanity, and sentient life in general. The question of what_~or whose_~values Al systems should be associated with is the most important of these (Gabriel, 2020) Furthermore, there is a lack of clarity and consistency in the worldwide debates about Al that are taking place among governments and the private sector on what the guiding principles should be for policymakers, academics,  and companies. There is widespread agreement that legislative   guidelines and safeguards are needed for the use of AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning) in healthcare; but; before effective legislation can be developed, there must be consensus on the technology's vision and goal. 3 key

Page 19:

Regulation is built on the foundation of pre-existing ideas and beliefs about what technology is, what it seeks to achieve, and how it should be utilised: This involves (1) Determining how it will not be utilised and (2) assessing the risks that should be avoided. Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Al principles identify as the following (OECD, 2023): Al should benefit people and the planet by driving inclusive growth, sustainable development; and well-being Al systems should be designed in a way that respects the rules of law, human rights; democratic values, and diversity, and should include appropriate safeguards for example, enabling human intervention where necessary to ensure a fair and just society There should be transparency and responsible disclosure around Al systems to ensure that people understand Al-based outcomes and can challenge them Al systems must function in a robust, secure and safe way throughout their life cycles, and potential risks should be continually assessed and managed Organisations and  individuals  developing, deploying or operating Al systems should be held accountable for their proper functioning in line with the above principles: The OECD also provides specific recommendations to governments on to put these value- based principles into action: Facilitate public and private investment in research & development to spur innovation in trustworthy Al Foster  accessible Al ecosystems with   digital infrastructure and technologies and mechanisms to share data and knowledge Ensure a policy environment that will open the way to deployment of trustworthy Al systems Empower people with the skills for Al and support workers for a fair transition Co-operate across borders and sectors to progress on responsible stewardship of trustworthy Al. The application of the OECD principles is still questioning since many organisations have their own principles of Al usage as well These themes call out areas that need to be addressed in any future policy or law governing the use of Al such as privacy, accountability, safety and security, transparency and explainability,  fairness and non-discrimination, human control of technology, professional responsibility, and promotion of human values. To fit with Cambodia's vision of the future for utilisation of Al, strategic adaptation of Al usage, the concepts from the OECD and other major organisations should be examined in order to develop country rule, they how key

Al-powered business and industry: Transforming Business Landscape in Cambodia 2.1 . Business Artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionise many aspects of business, from improving decision-making and automation to enabling new products and services. In recent years, Al has become increasingly widespread in business, with many organisations adopting Al technologies to a competitive edge. However, Cambodian businesses are yet to take a full advantage of Al solutions. One of the key ways that Al is being used in business is for decision-making and automation: Al algorithms are able to process vast amounts of data and identify patterns and trends that can inform business decisions  This allows organisations to make more accurate and efficient decisions, which can lead to improved operations and increased profitability. In addition, Al is being used to automate many tasks and processes in business: For example, Al algorithms can be used to automate customer service, data entry, and other routine tasks, freeing up employees to focus on more complex and value-added activities. This can help to increase productivity and reduce costs. In Cambodia; simple machine Al for use in industrial factories is being developed by Quantum Engineering and Manufacturing: Another area where Al is having a significant impact on business is in the development of new products and services. Al algorithms are being used to create personalised experiences for customers, such as personalised product recommendations and personalised content: This can help to improve customer satisfaction and fidelity , and can also drive revenue growth. However; the use of Al in business is not without its challenges One of the key issues is the need for specialised skills and expertise. Developing and deploying Al algorithms requires a high level of technical knowledge, and many organisations may struggle to find the necessary talent: In addition; there are often ethical and privacy concerns surrounding the use of Al in business, and organisations need to carefully consider these issues Some of the industries that can benefit from Al in Cambodia are healthcare, education, and finance. For healthcare, Al can be used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnoses; and to identify potential health risks and preventative measures. For example, Al can analyse medical images and identify abnormalities, such as tumors or other potential health issues: This can help to improve the quality of healthcare and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis: There are currently already developed equipment and tools that Cambodian healthcare centers can acquire and implement: 5 gain

Page 21:

In addition, Al can be used in education in Cambodia to improve the quality of and accessibility to education: For example, Al can be used to create personalised learning experiences for students, allowing them to learn at their own pace and in a way that is tailored to their individual needs. This can help to improve student outcomes and increase the efficiency of the education system. Another area where Al is beginning to have an impact in Cambodia is in finance. Al is being used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of financial transactions, and to identify potential fraud and money laundering: This can help improve the security and reliability of the financial system, and can also help increase the access to financial services for individuals and businesses: Al is transforming many aspects of business, and its impact is to continue to grow in the coming years. Organisations that are able to effectively adopt and integrate Al technologies are likely to gain a competitive advantage, while those that are unable to do so may struggle to keep pace in the competition. Overall, the development and adoption of Al in Cambodia is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to transform many aspects of society: The key challenges and opportunities in this area include the need for specialised skills and expertise, as well as the need to address ethical and privacy concerns: With continued investment and development, Al has the potential to greatly benetit Cambodia in the coming years. 2.2. Infrastructure Artificial intelligence is a rapidly growing field that has the potential to transform many aspects of society , from healthcare and transportation to finance and education. However, for Al to reach its full potential, it requires a robust infrastructure that can support the development and deployment of Al systems: Currently in Cambodia, there is no proper Al infrastructure that allows complex development in the field. In this report; we will explore the current state of Al infrastructure and discuss some of the key challenges and opportunities in this area generally and in Cambodia (Sallomi et al., 2018). Al infrastructure refers to the hardware, software, and other resources that are needed to support the development and deployment of Al systems (Muller, 2022) . It includes the hardware and software platforms, data storage and management systems, and other tools and resources that are required to build, train, and deploy Al models: One of the components of Al infrastructure is the hardware on which Al algorithms are run In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the availability of specialised hardware for Al, such as graphical processing units and tensor processing units. These hardware platforms are designed to be highly efficient at running the complex calculations required by many Al algorithms, allowing them to perform faster and more accurately. However, the development of likely key

Page 22:

specialised hardware for Al is not without its challenges: One of the key issues is the cost of these platforms, which can be prohibitively expensive for many organisations. In addition, the rapid pace of innovation in the Al hardware space means that the hardware used for Al today may quickly become outdated: Another important component of Al infrastructure is the availability of data. Al algorithms require large amounts of high-quality data to be trained and tested: The availability of data is therefore a key factor in the development of Al systems. However; the collection and curation of high-quality data can be a time-consuming and expensive process. In addition, there are often privacy and ethical concerns surrounding the use of data for Al purposes. One potential solution to these challenges is the use of synthetic data, which is data that is generated artificially rather than collected from real-world sources: Synthetic data has the advantage of being readily available and controllable, but it can be difficult to ensure that it accurately reflects the real-world conditions that Al systems will encounter (Dilmegani, 2022): In addition to hardware and data, Al infrastructure also includes the software tools and platforms that are used to develop and deploy Al systems There are a wide variety of tools and platforms available, ranging from open-source libraries and frameworks to proprietary software tools. This includes programming languages such as Python, and libraries such as TensorFIow, and PyTorch, as well as tools for data preprocessing, model training, and model deployment: These tools and platforms can make it easier for developers to build and deploy Al systems, but can also introduce their own challenges, such as vendor lock-in and the need for specialised skills. Other parts of Al infrastructure include the data storage and management systems to store and organise the large datasets that are used to train and test Al models  This may include data warehouses, databases, and other storage systems that are designed to handle the scale and complexity of Al data: Overall, the development of Al infrastructure is a complex and rapidly evolving field: For a country like Cambodia to participate in this development; it requires a combination of specialised hardware, high-quality data, and powerful software tools and platforms: The challenges and opportunities in this area are numerous, but with continued investment and innovation, Al has the potential to transform many aspects of society in the coming years. Thus, a robust plan for Al investment and implementation might be a worthwhile challenge for Cambodia. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of business, from improving decision-making and automation to enabling new products and services. Moreover, Cambodian businesses are to take full advantage of Al solutions: they yet

One keyway Al is used in the business is for decision-making and automation: Hence, Al algorithms can process vast amounts of data and identify patterns and trends that can inform business decisions, allowing organizations to make more accurate and efficient decisions, leading to improved operations and increased profitability. In addition, Al is being used to automate many tasks and processes in business For example, AI algorithms can automate customer service, data entry, and other routine tasks, freeing employees to focus on more complex and value-added activities (Scheneider , 2017). This can help to increase productivity and reduce costs. For example, in Cambodia, simple machine Al for use in industrial factories is being developed by Quantum Engineering and Manufacturing: Another area where Al is having a significant impact on business is in the development of new products and services.

At the same time, those unable to do so may need help to keep pace with the competition. Overall, the development and adoption of Al in Cambodia are still in their early stages, but it can potentially transform many aspects of society. The challenges and opportunities in this area include the need for specialized skills and expertise and the need to address ethical and privacy concerns: Nevertheless, with continued investment and development; Al has the potential to benetit Cambodia in the coming years greatly. 8 gain key

3_ Al Revolution: Global Trends and Practical Applications In today's data-driven world, the application of Al around the world continues to grow exponentially: Firms and organisations across all sectors strive to maximise the potential of their data, to make improved decisions for commercial purposes and social impact. From a technical perspective, there exists several forms of Al applications such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Hybrid Learning, and Digital   Twins: According to pricewaterhousecoopers (2023), Machine Learning can be utilised for 3D mapping of bridge construction based on data from drones, as well as for spotting insider trading: In addition, Deep Learning is being used to develop customer behavior models: Furthermore, Hybrid  Learning that is based on probabilistic programming in using incomplete information to work with   uncertainty, can be beneficial for analysing market behavior and regulatory environments Finally, Digital Twins that replicate virtually physical and non-physical assets, are ideal for capital project management and helping financial institutions to model individual policyholders, as well as simulate future balance sheets and cash flows: Moving onto more practical use cases of Al, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan ""6 Trends in Data and Al for 2021 and Beyond"" mentions that: ""1) Companies continue bold momentum, 2) Customer experience analytics take center stage, 3) Those who leverage external data outperform competitors by double digits, 4) Chief Data Officers lead the charge toward a data-driven culture, 5) Data science loses its luster, and 6) Data exposes wide gaps in equity and also empowers change' Trend 1) Companies continue bold momentum focuses on the continuous growth of Al applications during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the acceleration of cloud migration plans, taking advantage of this disruptive period to challenge the status quo and undergo digital transformation, as well as focusing on the first 1% of change which is often the most challenging step. Trend 2) Customer experience analytics take center stage highlights the importance of customer-related data to improve customer experience with the help of data fabric and data lakehouse, and analysing different forms of interactions such as voice analytics and customer interaction with chatbots or call centers. Trend 3) Those who leverage external data outperform competitors by double digits emphasises starting with the core business problem, followed by strategising what potential data could be utilised to solve it, in addition to modernising data flows. Cindi Howson, Chief Data Strategy Officer of Thoughtspot; shared that The range of data sources has exploded, the only thing lacking here is really your imagination:' Trend 4) Chief Data Officers (CDOs) lead the charge toward a data-driven culture shines a light on the growing significance of CDO roles, in showing companies and employees the efficiency gained with using data, consequently requiring the upskill of workers to take full advantage of new technologies Trend 5) Data science loses its luster discusses the importance of   rebalancing the overemphasis on coding and math, but rather focusing on business application and improving communications skills and data storytelling: Trend 6) Data exposes wide gaps in equity and

empowers change narrows down on the biased data and lack of team diversity building Al programs; which in turn; skews the output of Al algorithms: In conclusion, the article conveys that Al applications should strive for a ""smarter, more fact-driven world, powered by data and analytics"" Brown; 2021). The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to the establishment of a wide range of Al applications, in efforts to tackle its resulting challenges. Forbes ""The 4 Top Artificial Intelligence Trends for 2021 describes several use cases of Al, starting with smarter big data analytics and insights. Big Data and Al applications are being utilised to quickly analyse and interpret data on the spread of the virus around the world, including a Natural Language Processing (NLP) powered search engine to navigate COVID-19 related literature in data sets, as well as Machine Learning to identify outbreaks with more ease, contact tracing between infected individuals, enabling more accurate diagnoses, predicting virus evolution, and developing more effective lasting vaccinations: In addition, automated detection and prevention is being carried out in the form of drones to detect COVID-19 symptoms such as high temperature of individuals in crowds, in combination with computer vision to analyse camera data. Businesses are also utilising data to rebound from the commercial and economic impacts of the pandemic, by predicting behavioral transformation: Finally, collaborative Al initiatives are being prepared around the world; to shut down the next pandemic before it even starts Learning from the past pandemics and the current COVID-19 pandemic, the international exchange of relevant data and best practices will play a major role in preparing for the future (Marr, 2020). 4 Driving Al Development in Cambodia: The Power of Collaboration Generic introduction of the chapter; why is collaboration important? Where to start? How to start? What are the challenges for local and global collaboration? What will be the impact of success and failure on building collaboration? Collaboration   plays a pivotal role in knowledge   sharing; particularly important for multi- disciplinary/multi-country   research, innovation and development work In many occasions; knowledge sharing occurs through reported articles that are not security-sensitive, do not have Intellectual Property Right (IPR) issues and are not sensitive to financial income. Globally , many countries developed strategic agreements to share their knowledge related to security   (for example, the UK with the US) , business and socio-economic growth: Data collection, analysis and decision making using Al are playing a significant role in this type of knowledge sharing framework The knowledge sharing framework brings various benefits, for example, this saves a significant research or innovation investment for the reinvention of the wheel: The Cambodian government and businesses should take initiative to develop similar  regional and global collaboration based on the needs of the socio-economic growth and security of the country: This requires developing a strategic framework for specific data or knowledge to be shared for the 10

Page 26:

important sectors: security, innovation and research, crisis and disaster management, cultural understanding; economic growth, health and well-being: Failure to build this type of strategic collaborative knowledge   sharing activity will   bring detrimental effects on the sustainable development Goals (SDGs) (Sustainable Development Solution Network; 2023) and security (particularly , cybersecurity) of the country: However; the challenges in building collaboration are normally the trust of the stakeholders, barriers for mutual economic benefits and communication/cultural gaps between the   parties. To overcome these challenges, the stakeholders need to communicate and discuss developing a strategic long-term regional and global collaboration framework using data and knowledge sharing infrastructure. 4.1. Quadruplel Triple Helix Approach are the stakeholders' engagementlcollaborations important, particularly for a country like Cambodia? Who will take initiative? How? When? How to prepare a sustainable collaborative framework? What are the key factors that may stimulate applied research and innovation to build collaboration? Should we start with Quadrupleltriplelboth helix approaches? Financing R&D Policy formulation Education Innovation Incubators Government Academia Spin-off:s support Advisory services Collaboration Entrepreneurial platform venturing Legitimatinglink Product and Industry Civfl society Competence & service process development development Carrying individua and structural perspectives Figure 1. Collaborative Quadruple Helix Framework (Lindberg et al, 2014) The stakeholders' engagementlcollaborations are important particularly in a country like Cambodia because we need to enhance the development of new knowledge and to transform this knowledge into innovations: Cambodia's development challenges include manufacturing;, agriculture, healthcare, transportation, energy, science and technology. The initiative needs to come from the local government as it plays an important role in integrating changes in principles and practices into local development and investment plans: Working together to establish   relationships toward a process to generate the outcome of something in common are essential  characteristics that may inspire  applied research and innovation to foster collaboration. Because addressing issues requires more than one person, 11 key Why

Page 27:

group, or organisation, collaborative connections are critical; hence, the outcome of collaboration might generate new metrics of success in economic development. collaborative approach includes more than just working together. It refers to the ability to work together and take action on large-scale projects. Traditional strategic planning is not a good model for the disciplines that will be required to rebuild our economy. Thinking together refers to a series of interactions  involving  academics (the   university) , business, and government  in order to encourage economic and social growth through a Triple Helix model of innovation. Several nations have embraced the Triple Helix approach to foster innovation through the notion of institutions and policy making: The Triple Helix interaction pattern is said to be capable of establishing links and interactions between   science and technology, as well as gathering individuals from many disciplines to engage in the process of information exchange; ideas, and thoughts: The quadruple helix paradigm may be regarded as an improvement on the triple helix approach in that it not only focuses on the players from academics, government; and business but also acknowledges society's growing involvement: The framework seeks to bridge the gap between innovation and civil society, claiming that under the triple helix paradigm, new technologies do not necessarily meet societal expectations and requirements, limiting their potential effect: Investing more in research, innovation, and entrepreneurship should be at the core of Cambodia's development strategy, since it is the only way to achieve smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth. This idea expands on the triple helix model by assuming that society, in addition to academics, business, and government; is a significant actor in innovation processes Cambodia may be ideal for creating smart specialisation plans based on the quadruple helix method, which would create an environment conducive to entrepreneurship and innovation; which has been identified as a priority by policymakers and politicians. This is primarily because innovation and entrepreneurship are viewed as means to create new employment while also raising living standards through new and improved products. However, in order for the quadruple helix method to work we need a good leader who can turn knowledge into action. A good Leader needs to be good with the group and be able to manage the  multidisciplinarylmulti-countries   collaborative teamwork: How can we   effectively support individuals while simultaneously changing big systems? By follow some of these rules: One conversion at the time, stay focused as design thinking offers an approach for addressing these and other big questions Restraint from criticising an idea Work with cool ideas and buildable 12

Common and Inclusive Development What are the common issues that may stimulate mutual benefits and opportunities of collaboration? What are the challenges (including the digital divide) for inclusive development? How could we develop a collaborative framework that will help in inclusive development? Which stakeholders should contribute to addressing the inclusive issue and in what form a table might help? Biasness, inequality and ethical issues related to inclusive development: The common issues that may stimulate mutual benefits and opportunities of collaboration are manufacturing; agriculture, healthcare, transportation, energy, science and technology: The challenges including the digital divide for inclusive development are: Skill gap in Al at all educational levels This involves revisions at the elementary, secondary, and tertiary levels of education to include Al-related courses and programs into school curriculum: It is also necessary to provide chances for instructors to receive training and upskill in order to teach Al-related courses: Second; numerous policies give specific incentives for large-scale lifelong learning and reskilling via massive open online courses and reskilling: Gender inequality in science and technology fields Skill shortages are a major impediment to innovation, stifling productivity growth and economic progress. Shortages of skilled professionals in areas linked to Science, Technology, Engineering; and Mathematics (STEM) in particular may limit a society's ability to innovate. Over the years, a significant gender disparity has remained at all levels of STEM disciplines around the world Throughout the world, a significant gender disparity has remained at all levels of STEM fields: Despite significant gains in women's involvement in higher education; they remain underrepresented in these professions  This issue is particularly serious at the top of academic and professional hierarchies.

engineering graduates tend to grow faster than countries with a higher proportion of graduates in other disciplines Lack of Al policy related to smart governance, smart innovation and smart regulations The absence of information in Cambodia refrains academics from furthering their understanding of the problem and policymakers from devising effective remedies This note intends to add to the regional academic and policy discussion by examining the key variables proposed in the literature to explain gender discrepancies in STEM recruitment, retention, and promotion, as well as by proposing new factors: Ethical, Privacy and IPR issues The ethical issues of Al applications are growing significantly. This includes data privacy and IPR associated with the data: Therefore, a strategic plan is essential to avoid misusing Al growth and data associated with that. 4.3_ Global Education, Research and Innovation Why is the global collaboration for knowledge sharing through education, research and innovation important? What are types of collaboration to be developed? With which organisationslcountries? How to build these collaborations? What are the funding agencies that may help in stimulating this collaboration? How to develop trainedlskilled manpower to build collaboration hire initially? When to start and where to start? Research-informed teaching to accelerate the process National Al and Data Centre for Research and Development (R&D) Commercialisation of the outcomes of Al research & innovation Research, innovation, research-informed teaching and Al application development to solve real- world problems are interconnected as shown in Figure 2. It reflects multidisciplinary collaborative teamwork is always to achieve success. Al application is a market-driven dynamic area, therefore , requires global collaboration and rapid policy actions to play with the international partners: This also requires   continuously identifying skill gaps in education, research and innovation: Based on the gap, there should be a method to train young talent abroad to fill this gap. Subsequently, offer an attractive incentive to the trained talent to return to the existing workforce at home. To create this   opportunity, Cambodia   needs to develop a strategic collaboration with   regional and global institutions, offer   scholarship based higher  study for 14 key

talented young people and make an attractive support framework with a national Al and data centre as their home. A strategic plan for R&D is very important to cope with the Al-enabled advancement in the world. The plan should have objectives and a direction of advancements to amplify efficiency. Cambodia sees itself thriving significantly in creating world-class research and advancement in some innovation fields: It is obligatory that Al is embedded in the R&D as well as other divisions to leverage its potential application. Based on our investigation, we recommend the following in the strategic plan: Need to set up a centre of excellence with leading experts from different backgrounds to work together for Al, data and associated technologies collaborative framework (see Figure 2) with industries, universities, government and young entrepreneurs for applied research and innovation for knowledge transfer Regular engagement for knowledge sharing through meetings, seminars and interactive workshops Government investment strategy with an appropriate policy framework to promote the job skills of the young people Development of research centres in the universities in collaboration with industries and business to promote researchlinnovation informed teaching Develop a database of experts in Cambodia to promote collaborative activities with government support Develop a policy and practices for security, privacy and ethical issues related to the data and AI applications Need continuous exploration for potential regional and global research and innovation funds, stafflstudent exchange opportunities and partnership development to exchange knowledge Last but not least; develop a strategic framework to attract young people for new skill sets through a public-private partnership Finally, Cambodia is moving towards a digital economy with new challenges as a middle-income country in 2030. A collaborative framework as shown in Figure 2 with strategic investment and policy is essential to develop skill sets of young people for Al applications. As applied research is key to generating knowledge, we need to embed this into the teaching, training and innovation for dynamic technology changes with a focus on sustainable economic growth. 15

A collaborative framework to work together to develop new skill sets, research, research informed teaching and innovation: 5. Al for Socio-economic Transformation: A Strategic Vision and Roadmap 5.1. Socio-economic Impact Accenture research on 12 developed economies countries indicated that Al has the power to double annual economic growth rates in 2035, changing the nature of work and creating a new relationship between man and machine. Also, the world economic forum reported that Al and Robots would create more jobs than they displace. Because of Al and related technologies, economic growth will boost up than ever before and create many additional job opportunities According to McKinsey Global Institute, about 160 cases of SDGs where Al can be instrumental in solving problems It has been suggested that Al can help a country such as Cambodia achieve approximately 80 percent of all the development targets listed in SDGs by 2030 largely through the improvement of technology itself which is the main component in economic growth theory (Vinuesa et al,, 2020). In particular; Al can, for instance, help increase productivity and income and thereby significantly decrease absolute poverty or identify areas with a high poverty rate for further action (Jean et al,, 2016) (Goal 1), support agriculture and provision of food to end hunger (Gandhi et al,, 2017) (Goal 2), lead to better health outcome and efficiency of healthcare delivery including diagnostics (Yu et al,, 2018) (Goal 3), improve teaching and learning method by offering intelligent tutoring system that tailors to specific student's needs and thus boost the quality of education (Perrotta & Selwyn, 2020) (Goal 4), and enable the design of sustainable smart cities and reduce consumptions of natural resources (Vinuesa et al., 2020) (Goal 11). 16

Page 32:

On the micro-level; Al can help the market system improve resource allocation and industrial organisation and strengthen firms' competitiveness (Phyrom et al,, 2022). Moreover, data and Al are said to reduce information asymmetry; which is a form of market failure allowing the market to reach an optimal equilibrium: In terms of labor market structure, opportunities will arise as new kinds of services industries and businesses, namely e-commerce (e.g-, Amazon, Alibaba, eBay) , e-payment (e.g;, Alipay, PayPal), and social media (e.g-, Facebook, Twitter) , will also emerge (Phyrom et al, 2022). And with those come new types of employment: It is predicted by the World Economic Forum that about 133 million new jobs will be created by 2025 in several sectors, including Artificial Intelligence, robotics, immersive technology, green technology, and blockchain (World Economic Forum; 2018). In addition, the nature of the employment itself, especially jobs related to software and technology development and multimedia; will be more flexible owing to the fact that now we can collaborate more effectively using an online platform and that workers no longer need to commute to their physical workplace. But at the same time, questions have also been raised about the possible negative impacts of Al on patients, especially ethical issues regarding how personal data should be treated: Al requires large amount of data which has gradually become a new oil that can be generated endlessly every and such data is handy for many ways and reasons, yet it can pose serious challenges if it falls into the wrong hands or rival countries, and that will compromise national securities along with other dimensions of socio-economic development   Considering the current Cambodian context   in which   cybersecurity  is limited in infrastructure and human knowledge,  security breaches should be the top priority: It should be highlighted that Al still needs data, and Al is useless if the data is bad or contaminated by cybercriminals who might use the data to sell in the black market or for scamming purposes because the data is both marketable and profitable. In addition, increasing the use of big data and algorithms or artificial intelligence in general also means an increase in energy use which may hinder Cambodia's progress toward Goals 7 and 13. The latter is about taking action against climate change by regulating COz emissions, improving energy efficiency, and reducing fuel power consumption: Even though Cambodia has almost achieved universal energy coverage, energy is mostly accessible among the urban population, while the rural population still finds it difficult to gain access to a state-provided electrical power And without stable and sufficient energy; Al might not be useful for rural development; particularly in the agriculture and manufacturing industry, further engendering digital division between rural and urban areas. Al effects on the Reduced Inequalities (Goal 10) is also questionable , for it is still an expensive technology since data is costly to collect; and expertise in developing algorithms is hard to come by even for developed countries, let alone the developing one. As a result; it is only affordable by the richer   countries rather than; the poorer nations, and that will   exacerbate the current 17 day; grid.

Page 33:

inequalities among countries, for the developed states tend to be the ones who can build exorbitant infrastructure to support Al expansion and application, and thus they are able to enjoy more benefits deriving from it: In the case of an individual country such as Cambodia; Al technology is likely to be able to afford only by the rich or major corporations, which tends to increase income inequality. Although Al might help boost productivity, the benefits might not really go towards the poor, creating an obvious two highly divided segments in a single society and thereby social issues: It is suggested that a strong mechanism such as a progressive tax to counter the byproduct or externality of Al should be in placed first: On top of that; artificial intelligence is likely to place blue-collar workers on the brink of job loss and subsequently increase inequalities within a nation (Brynjolfsson & Mcafee, 2016). It is worth noting that workers need to have decent skills to operate Industry 4.0 technology which tends to reward educated individuals handsomely yet at the same time heavily punish low-skilled workers who conventionally come from a disadvantaged background: This partially helps explain why there has been an increase in the wage gap between college and high school graduates in the United States: Additionally, more automation is translated into less human labor. Hence, Al is likely to reduce demand for but increase the supply of manual workers, decrease their wages, and eventually transfer more wealth from workers to firm owners: In Cambodia; such a structural change in the economy can be detrimental considering that the vast majority of workers in the manufacturing industries, including the garment sector, are lIoW-skilled young adults who are unlikely to utilise Al technology and hence prone to job displacement: It is explicable that there is always a tradeoff between efficiency and equity, but there must be more winners than losers. And the losers should be compensated fairly. In this regard, a process to do so must be considered first before implementing Al technology to ensure that national technology advancement policies are not there only to enrich firms and employers; otherwise, Al-led economic development will lead to even more social challenges. Simply put; it does more harm than good to society. With that said, a valid question should be asked: is Cambodia ready? Cambodia's commitment to  responsible innovation and   research ethics   provides a solid foundation for integrating Al ethics into its STI policy: By balancing scientific progress with ethical considerations, Cambodia fosters integrity and social responsibility: Upholding human security, addressing bias and discrimination, and promoting transparency and accountability are aspects of Al ethics that Cambodia towards a future where Al benefits society while safeguarding its values: 5.2. Skilling and Re-skilling the Workforce in Cambodia Technology has been changing the nature of the workforce in all sectors, from small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs) to big industry, which lead the trends of the new jobs require the 21st century skills (World Bank Group, 2018). It is expected that by 2025, nearly 100 million new jobs 18 key guide

Page 34:

will be created by using digital technology (World Economic Forum; 2018). Emerging technologies such as cloud computing, big data, cyber security, immersive technology, game, Al, cobotics, Internet of Things   (loTs) , Block-chain and 3D printing are likely to adopted by industries, businesses, health and well-being, agriculture and education in the future. It is reported that at least 50% of the tasks (40% of current occupations) are at high risk, and 65% of the jobs the next generation will do in 2030 do not exist (Rethy et al,, 2019). It is well recognised that there are no ways to tackle the 4th industrial revolution, especially job-loss issues without skilling and re-skilling the Al workforce: In this regard, it is very crucial for government and stakeholders to prepare the digital skill sets for the future labour force. According to Van Laar et al: in 2020, the 21st century digital skills are technical knowledge, information finding creativity and   innovation, critical   thinking, reasoning and complex   problem solving, and interpersonal skills such as communication, collaboration, negotiation and teamwork  With the industrial revolution 4.0, countries around the world, as well as Cambodia have developed their own strategies and policies related to Al. STEM education policy was proposed to encourage students to go for STEM majors after their graduating from high school whereas technical and vocational education and training (TVET) policy and 15-year Cambodia Digital Economy and Society Policy Framework were to promote technical and technology skill development (Ratha & Phirom; 2021). Similarly; to make the existing workforce survive and make it ready for those entering the workplace, the Cambodia's STI Roadmap 2030 and policy focus on improving human capita in science and technology, especially Al in both quantity and quality, and gender equity. The current highly skilled workforce in Cambodia is still in low number which necessitate an education system reform to prepare in building modern skillsets for the future (World Bank Group; 2018) . From the employer perspective, as shown in Figure 3_ Skills in Cambodia (Bruni et al:_ 2013) , the most major skill gap is foreign language skills, and practical skills (Bruni et al._ 2013). In reskilling and upskilling for the human resource of the 21st century, all education levels need to adapt to Al Education curriculum which Al and digital literacy should have been introduced to our young people since their early age of study. Building up strong background for students in math; English , critical thinking; art, design, animation and coding is crucial in making pathway for them to step foot into the future modern skills (Hor & Hesketh; 2021). In addition to the education reform, to strengthen the future skill sets, it is requiring the participants from all the stakeholders such as governments, universities, industries and societies. To ensure the workforces are ready to meet the future demands of the domestic and foreign labour market; government should give priority to innovative research, STEM education, creativity, and critical thinking skills. Apart from Al and  digital   knowledge, emotional intelligent skills such as working as a team and communicating with other people are significant for the company well performing, productivity increment; and collaborating with outsiders_ 19 yet ability , Gap

Skills Gap in Cambodia (Bruni et al,, 2013) From the Al workshop (12th June 2021 with all potential stakeholders) , the finding indicated that Cambodian fresh graduates lack of both soft skills and hard skills (Hor & Hesketh, 2021). Universities neither transfer such knowledge to students, nor create educational situations for them to acquire these essential skills. In this regard, it was suggested that educational institutions should be in closely relationship with private firms to build good curriculum that match with industry demands: With the partnership, students and teaching will have opportunity to expose themselves to the real-world problem and also staff of the industries can have chance to do research and upskill with the researchers from the universities. From the seminar discussion, to develop new skill sets and upskills for the future work force, there are some recommendations as following: Establishing center of excellence to work on advanced technologies Building a collaboration framework for knowledge transfer between industries; universities, government and young entrepreneurs Conducting regular knowledge sharing session through seminars and workshops Proposing strategy and policy to promote job skills for young people Creating research and innovation center within the universities Developing a directory of specialists Developing an Al policy Seeking for the source of fund for supporting research and innovation works Developing policy framework to captivate youth for new skillsets: Skills, Data, and Multi-disciplinary Knowledge Sharing are critical in Al development Table below shows the major skills and re-skills required for different sectors: 20

Page 36:

Three significant challenges that will be needed to exploit full potential of Al applications: data collection and accessibility, inter-disciplinary knowledge sharing framework, and shortage of talent who can improve Al capabilities, stimulate new ideas, and implement solutions To address the challenges, Cambodia can develop the following strategic pillars of Al: i) Centre of excellence for applied research, innovation, training; and implementation, ii) skilling and reskilling of Al and associated workforce with local and global institutional supports, ii) data, knowledge sharing framework and digital infrastructure, iv) GDPR, ethics, data privacy, security, V) funding support for accelerating Al start-ups, research and  innovations, and vi)  industrialisation/commercialisationldeployment of the Al- enabled technologies.

Data Privacy, Ethic, Security and Regulations While Al promises a positive net   benefit   for  society and economy, it also poses a great responsibility and risk when it comes to privacy, ethics, and security. As one may define Al, it is machine brain that accumulates learnings from data to create intelligence rather than rules explicitly codified by human programmers to perform tasks automatically: The key here is that the decision is increasingly being made by machine rather than human as it is enabled by data; computing resources, and advanced algorithms. Decisions made by Al could have consequences that affect fundamental rights and human beings. The question is to what extent Al decisions can be trustworthy, ethical and conformed to intrinsic human fundamental rights and values? 21 key

Overview of the Data Protection and Regulation in Cambodia Cambodia has not yet enacted any comprehensive data protection legislation. The first to the country's data protection landscape has come in the form of the E-Commerce Law (only available in Khmer) , which contains provisions for the protection of consumer data that has been gathered over the course of   electronic   communication: The E-Commerce Law is thereby restricted in scope to virtual andlor digital data protection. Currently only few laws and regulations that express privacy and data protection include the Constitution, Civil Code, Laws on Telecommunications and the Press Laws. Ministry of Interior lawyers and data specialists chaired a meeting to discuss the first draft of a sub-degree on the management; use, privacy safeguard and security of data the governments have collected that can potentially be used to identify individuals on January 25, 2021. On January 18, specialists from the ministry's Legislation Council and heads of the ministry's general directorates and departments discussed an initial draft comprising six chapters and 16 articles: The purpose of this sub-decree was to determine rules for the management, use and privacy protections for identifying data that would serve public interests, promote service provision quality and develop the nation in a highly efficient and secure manner: Data Protection and Regulation Vision Cambodia seeks to harmonise among the existing laws and  rights mentioned earlier   for standardisation into a more targeted and specific data protection laws that governs sensitive personal data and its security needs across its lifespans in capture, storage, sharing; use, and archive. Cambodia desires to balance risks and create conditions for a trustworthy Al sector to grow in a healthy, responsible and safe manner with initiatives to establish a national ethical framework committee body and data   regulation laws conformed to the regional and international standards: That way, principles and practices for unbiased use of Al are formed to promote fairness, ethics, inclusivity, transparency, and accountability so that citizens and businesses can adopt the use of Al in a protected and safe manner: Cambodia recognises risks of heavy regulation seeing regulation may be too strict because it forfeit foreign investment in the technology sector; especially so in a small country like Cambodia without sufficiently qualified human resources and technological advancement to manage data centres and security at the scale big tech firms are capable of. Cambodia and its citizens have to answer this question as We move into the digital economy: why would large digital technology and manufacturing firms rather invest in Cambodia and not in   Singapore or   Vietnam? What competitive advantage and drivers do we exhibit relative to neighboring countries in attracting and 22 update may

retaining foreign investment? with an understanding that regulation in nature tends to de- motivate innovation and slow down growth in exchange for a safer and fairer society as regulation increases compliance responsibility and constrains business behaviors to a set of social, ethical, and legal norms especially if poorly designed and implemented. Heavy regulation will likely hurt local digital businesses who emerge to cultivate innovation and experimentation to create new business lines and stimulate growth because they may not prepare to take administrative and compliant burdens; while a lack of regulatory clarity injects fears of heavy fines that could destroy business startup and survival: Having said that; it is in the nation's interest to establish data protection laws to manage harms while providing regulatory clarity to guide businesses in ways of handing user data and consent;, particularly user identifiable information such as name, date of birth, identity, and any other data objects that could reveal an individual identity. Importantly, the world has increased the level of sophistication in digitalisation that captures and processes data across multiple jurisdictions so data protection laws to provide regulatory clarity for cross-border data management and Cloud technology adoption guidelines will be established. Because unlawful and iIl intention usage of these data   especially by bad actors cause harm to users, and therefore subject to legal responsibilities; penalty and fines. In this effort, Cambodia looks to legislate data protection laws to make businesses and service providers accountable to the management, collection and usage of data in a responsible manner and nurture Al fields for maximum benefits with respect to foundational elements of human rights while promoting adoption for economic gains. Data Privacy and Ethics Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights treats privacy as a distinct human right. Stated one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks_ In the Cambodian laws, it mentioned that citizens have rights to privacy: Definitive meanings to what privacy are remains ambiguous and subject to legal interpretation. However, data privacy often refers to the rights to be left alone and rights to be free of independent thoughts: Even So, privacy is a broad term that is essential to human dignity and autonomy for individual freedom: Yet when conflicted with other laws, rights to privacy may be restricted under certain conditions like to protect national security and public safety. For example, in the matter of criminal offenses to protect public safety the state may authorise and require persons or entities to reveal one's individual identity without the needs of the user's consent who is under suspicion. In this regard to the privacy needs of citizens,  Cambodia looks to establish a guideline to encourage organisations of all sizes to adopt privacy-by-design approach to developing Al applications while the establishment of the National Committee of Ethics will champion the guidelines and direction for the incorporation of ethics and privacy for Al. Given how early-stage 23 Along ""no

Page 39:

Al is in Cambodia and for many organisations of all sizes, it may be impractical to copy and paste regulation requirements from the likes of European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): A customised and localised standard data privacy and protection laws will be likely to align with the ASEAN regions. Basic elements like the collection of personal data shall have user consent and provide purpose information to such usages that protect user privacy and security. Individuals shall have rights to request, access, update, and remove at its user cost. Cambodia sees Al development conform to the ethical framework and social norms to ensure human values are protected, inclusion is encouraged, and fairness is   preserved without systematic discrimination against   humanity that causes perceptual bias and harms: The discrimination may be classified into a category of race, gender, physical ability, and economic background. Right protection to equitable, just and fair treatment in society is a fundamental responsibility of the state when it comes to inter-relation conflicts among individuals, businesses and government agents. However, it is the responsibilities of the organisations andlor goods and service providers that create Al applications and mismanage user data that affects one' ethical values: Decisions made by Al applications that affect society's fundamental and ethical values shall be thought out by design and undergo a standard user and system acceptance test aimed at ensuring a Trustworthy Al. Critical decisions whether in health, credit loan, insurance claim, and employment shall provide reasonable explanations to support why such decisions are being made. When in doubt, humans should be in the loop to ensure Al decisions behave as expected and trusted: And Al decisions are ethically sound and have a base of ethical foundation aligned to Cambodian constitutions and ethical framework Data Security Data security is the process of safeguarding data against unauthorised access and corruption throughout its lifespan from data collection, sharing; usage, and deletion. With the growing risks of attacks and intrusion, organisations adopting Al at any scale shall invest to build cybersecurity capability in human resource and security technologies to govern, protect and manage its data assets: Data security methods such as data  encryption, hashing, and tokenisation are essential to the way data is safeguard and protected across all applications and platforms: Because management of user data is ultimately the responsibility of good and service providers, security governance and checks shall be in place to protect user information from cyber security attack, leaks, scams, fraud, and loss. Risks of cyberthreats shall be studied, assessed and minimised at the organisation disposal. The intended or unintended consequences of poor management of data may cause various harms to users SO corporate organisations who handle large personal data especially related to personal finance and health shall be accountable and able to demonstrate compliance reporting: The organisation shall have at least a minimum of one in charge of creating and mandating its data policy , security, and governance. 24 cyber key person

In general, Cambodia desires to establish data   protection laws and guidelines to provide regulatory clarity for all data processes across its life spans and to protect users with regards to data privacy and ethics. Service providers shall adapt to a human rights by-design approach to minimise unintentional or hidden biases, any discrimination or other negative consequences on individuals with respect to human rights and basic freedoms. The government of Cambodia aims to design a well-informed regulatory framework consisting of best practices in the growing subject of Trustworthy Al, while emphasising the need of using Al in a fair, transparent; accountable, and responsible manner. 5.4. Strategic Investment for Al-Powered Cambodia After a series of up, down and side turns, the development of Al technology has made great progress globally emerging from research labs into more socially useful and commercially viable technology applications that present massive opportunities for a modern economy and society. Some refers to Al impact and disruption from the change and technological innovation to the early days' invention of electricity, steam and water as well as the automobiles, computers and the internet today: With billions of dollars expected to generate from Al globally, Cambodia sees the need and urgency to invest; adopt and prepare for this Al global force in line with Industry 4.0 trend as the economy increasingly becomes knowledge and digital based. A strategic investment in the field of Al introduces three major pillars to maximise benefits and minimise risks in the facilitation of Al development for nation-wide adoption, safety and sustainability: Invest in people building the nation capacity for a resilient workforce, growth and innovation Invest in technological infrastructure building a robust foundation Invest in a collaborative tech ecosystem building a sustained network of value providers. These strategic views aim to drive Cambodia's competitiveness in the region and attract foreign investment: As a small, growing nation rising from ashes, Cambodia is not in a position seeking to be a leader of Al in most domains but to strengthen its emerging role to contribute to the global economy as a hub for applied Al with young people talents to rapidly and innovatively prototype solutions to solve state-level, societal and economic problems. An investment in human capital, digital infrastructure, and ecosystem development help Cambodia maximise at every stage of development and adoption, while R&D in niched areas are encouraged to be innovative and pioneering: The investment in R&D also prevents critical adoption barriers and accelerates the use of Al for economic and societal benefits: For example, without investing in the core Khmer NLP Cambodia cannot maximise its benefits from Al applications like 25 yet gains

conversational chatbot using Khmer and any others that build on top of NLP requiring the native language. Cambodia also aims to establish a data protection regulation to provide regulatory clarity and ensure accountability for a trust worth Al to flourish responsibly that is in line with ASEAN and international data protection laws as well as conforms to the established social norms within an ethical framework with respect to human rights. 5.4.1. Invest in people building the nation capacity for a resilient workforce, growth and innovation This is in line with section 5.2. Skilling and Re-skilling the Workforce and the Rectangular Strategy IV from the Government of Cambodia. It looks to refine its positioning and competitiveness in the regional play: Needless to say, Al will disrupt and impact labor employment categories, which require strategic initiatives to facilitate labor mobility, rapid skills building and upgrading; skills transfers, and access to information. One of the greatest assets Cambodia has is its tech-savvy young population, where almost two-third of the population is under 30 years old. More and more young people are equipped with English speaking ability which will serve the needs of digital knowledge workers in the new era and in the ASEAN Economic Integration for labour mobility and interaction: By leveraging the rising young; talented individuals and tech startup entrepreneurs to build Phnom Penh digital hub for innovative applications, technology and data talents, Cambodia is prepared in human resource development to achieve higher middle-income status by 2030. People capability development is not only to build a home-grown young workforce sufficient to supply the country's economy but also the regional and international economy: A number of factors are considerations when it comes to Al talent development: 5.4.2. Mindset and literacy The government of Cambodia recognises building capacity for the labor workforce is a long-run effort: change management starts with mindset themselves, their family and institutions. The government aims to raise awareness and educate the population about the potential uses of Al, benefits, and its risks  This introduction aims at raising the national average level of digital literacy around basic technology usage so all segments of citizens including disable persons, lower-income group, female and elder can reap full benefits and not be digitally excluded: As Al becomes more prevalent, relationships between humans and machines will also need to develop and strengthen for a safe, knowledgeable, and growing society. Digital literacy programs around Al and STEM education will be campaigned and promoted targeting 1) the general population 2) parents for their confidence in job prospects of their kids' decision to enter STEM education 3) youths themselves to be aware and access information as they make informed educational decisions: The government will also look into policy design for promoting the demand side for Al and digital talents to power their institutions in both private and public sector such as tax credits for workforce training, and in particular act as the public-private collaboration and protection 26 key Any

Page 42:

enabler to increase private sectors' incentives for maximum impact and reduce frictional risks for a striving digital economy. All initiatives will be to ensure digital mindset; literacy, and attitude toward Al are well received and cover both the supply and demand side when it comes to human resource planning and development. 5.4.3. STEM graduates strong and growing economy highly correlates with STEM education as it serves to build labor forces to fill needs from the private and public sector: More importantly, with the applications of Al, STEM workers will need to think,; build, operate, and maintain Al. Critical preconditions like this for the Al sector to flourish in Cambodia will be explored, assessed and acted upon to build a robust local  talent pool in the field and overtime change the  dynamic of  foreign talent dependencies. Cambodia has made and continues to level up its effort to increase the number of STEM graduates per year working with the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport and in building early age interests of children toward STEM education, ensuring a sizable enrollment and minimal drop out in universities across city and provinces later on: With the recognition of the needs for practical lab and applied studies, Cambodia aims to foster and promote public-private partnerships such as employers and education institutions to establish internship standards that mutually benefit both the students and organisations. This effort is intended to establish educational and employment Iinks and create more chances of success, for example with government sponsored local and international internship programs in the STEM areas which will be shared, promoted and standardised. Sending students abroad for STEM internships will give them practical experience and exposure to the international work environment and standards while keeping brain drain in-check Collectively; it drives international competitiveness for employment opportunities when it comes to quality talents for local and international employers. Along with productivity gains expected for the economy with STEM graduates, their income is also expected to rise drastically into a new income bracket thus leveling up a multi-generational, socio-economic impact to them, families and society: 5.4.4. TVET graduates Beyond a STEM degree program, a new TVET education focusing on ICT are welcomed and promoted to complement university degree standards. Companies expect graduates to come with soft and technical skills that reflect the changing nature of industry and technology so require a rapidly evolving and regularly updated curriculum for quality teaching and practical excellence. A number of classroom-to-career institutions will be promoted to provide short-term, high skills, industry-relevant technology training to meet the rapid needs from private sector organisations and SMEs Cambodia aims to support these specific skills development programs especially in 27

the digital and technology fields such as but not limited to computer training, Al, software engineering, blockchain, robotics, data science, computer programming, and security: 5.4.5. Life-long learning for upskill and re-skill workforce In addition to these above education standards, Cambodia looks to develop life-long learning opportunities in its efforts to upskill and re-skill both private and public sector staff. Cambodia intends to explore e-skill credits where individuals can apply and use the credits with third-party providers to receive the training; developing their resilient adaptation to the inevitable force of automation and preparing for new job category creation by AI. Overall the life-long learning initiatives will increase citizen professional growth opportunities for better employment and higher income while boosting the nation's productivity. The impact of job loss and creation due to Al will be carefully studied in the context of Cambodia and plan initiatives for rapid upskill and reskilling implementation programs working with key multi-stakeholders including international development  organisations  and training  providers. Cambodia has witnessed the impact  of Covid19 pandemic that destroyed by-and-large the tourism sector that the economy has largely depended on. This major source of income powering the economy has been depleted with great uncertainty moving into the post-covid era: Garment  manufacturing sector, which has also significantly contributed to Cambodia's GDP, is another area greatly vulnerable to the global development of Al, high-tech investment and automation: It is a national concern that has been shared among ministries and development partners: Having said that; Cambodia works proactively to take calculated risks, minimise the expected damage, and cultivate opportunities that Al will create such as through the upskill and re-skill efforts to ensure a positive net impact from AI: 5.4.6. Invest in technological infrastructure building for a robust foundation Digital infrastructure is the backbone of a thriving economy for the internet era: A strong digital foundation is essential to maximise the benefits at scale with minimal security risks for vibrant and safe technological development in society: 5.4.7. Connectivity and telecommunication Cambodia enjoys a high mobile and broadband penetration rate Telecommunication services are provided with national-wide network coverage at affordable prices for customers--partly thanks to a regulatory environment that fosters market competition among mobile operators. Advancement in telecommunication technology such as the introduction of 5G infrastructure and fast-speed fiber optic will also further increase the nation's connectivity. While a high penetration rate of mobile phones and connectivity coverage is well acknowledged, Cambodia government will continue a regulatory environment that promotes investments to better telecommunications 28 cyber key

networks and services that support Al research, applications and usage. Particularly it aims to boost connectivity infrastructure further and promote public-private partnerships among hardware manufacturers, internet service providers and interested economic actors to increase household access and affordability for available hardware devices and fast-speed, high quality internet connection thus increasing citizen   participation in the digital economy and reap potential benefits: 5.4.8. Digital and data infrastructure In line with the 5.3. Data and Digital Infrastructure section, strategic investment into building a robust data and digital infrastructure ensures Cambodia facilitates the development of the Al sector. Al R&D requires storage and computing resources to be utilised in a collaborative, safe and secure manner. Cambodia will support the digital infrastructure architecture with high- performance physical servers and software in preparation for the country's ambition toward a digital economy and create a digital sandbox for innovation and collaboration among private sectors and research institutions to prototype solutions to societal and commercial applications of AI. Cambodia aims to develop a national data center facility to manage computing, data storage and network services to ensure smooth operation. Initiatives will also be taken around boosting the quality and access of the high-performant internet, computer network, security system, data center, social media, software, mobile and web applications: 5.4.9. Invest in the emerging technologies Cambodia government embraces digital technologies as we ve seen in the industry 4.0 agenda for e-government adoption at the state-level because it believes ICTs enable innovation for the country and not stifle it. The gap between the current pace of global technological development and adoption ability in Cambodia is increasingly widened for many areas; only a few niches where we are noticeably recognised as early adopters These niches can be said for the case of the Bakong blockchain-based technology system by the National Bank of Cambodia as among the first central banks in the world to deploy such revolutionary tech. The technology facilitates the settlement among financial institutions and lowers the cost of inter-cooperation for all end-users thus increasing financial access and inclusion. Another case can be said for the ID-Poor on- demand  digital  system and graph database by the Ministry of Planning working with development partners such as Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH and Australian Aid to better social registry and social protection with targeted assistance provision to the right poor households These technologies are newly adopted in Cambodia and have not been done at the same scope or scale before but have shown great promise, feasibility and nation-level impact; thus for the digital ambition that Cambodia strives to achieve will require investment into testing newly  emerged   technologies,  fostering a culture of trial-and-error experimentation with more collaborative R&D institutions, and building a know-how absorptive 29 Any key

ability for the nation to scale up the implementation efforts. Some examples of these emerging technologies include distributed big data storage with Hadoop/Spark for a single source of identity information; decentralised   applications with blockchain around ownership rights and data traceability with a security standard, Internet of Things such as drones and robotics to better agricultural output, digital platforms for e-services to increase citizen and business participation, cloud computing integration technologies with regulatory clarity and feasibility assessment to enable business organisations' accessibility for the world's powerful technological infrastructure and platforms to increase their productivity output per unit cost of production: 5.4.10. Invest in a collaborative tech ecosystem building an ecosystem for a sustained network of value providers Cambodia has the opportunity to achieve economic, security, and social gains in the Al sector for many domains: Yet it lacks key enabled and supported areas. For example, for e-commerce to function in the economy, which has taken a long time until it is being adopted more widely now in its growth acceleration partly thanks to the e-commerce law enacted in 2019, it requires not only the digital marketplace for buyers & sellers, but also logistics, digital payment; and customer protection that facilitates it. It is nearly impossible for any individual business to build every aspect at the same time thus relying on an ecosystem of various economic actors in the provision of products and services. The Cambodian government has made big steps and is committed to promote a robust collaborative ecosystem to increase overall benefits and reduce collaboration cost for the ecosystem actors One area is in the promotion of a vibrant startup ecosystem and tech hub supported by a local and international collaboration: For example, the co-investment initiatives with private institutional investors increases access to finance for startup and SME entrepreneurs with Khmer Enterprise's Entrepreneurship Fund by the Ministry of Economic and Finance. It also brings a well-known global VC (Startup 500) through its international collaboration and local corporations' partners to nurture the startup ecosystem: Tech entrepreneurship is demonstrated as a career path option which is actively promoted in addition to STEM workers: Cambodia encourages economic activities and initiatives that drive the next generation of digital businesses and startups that use digital and Al technologies through national award, grants, and investment. 5.5. Research and Innovation This section explores the state of the art of research landscape in Cambodia about Al. More importantly, the innovative aspect of the knowledge from Al research will be discussed in the context: At this point; it is important to root the term ""innovation"" viewed by Charpie in 1967 . He emphasised that innovation is made if five steps are made; which includes basic invention from ideas (ideation) , engineering design (micro piloting) , manufacturing (industrial scale) , 30

Page 46:

manufacturing startup (making a startup), and market diffusion (generating profit) . Al will be ubiquitous in our daily life in next decade, especially in decision making process, improving workflow and efficiency, health care, education, and financial sector: For instance, it is suggested that Al capacity will surely add value to the efficiency and accuracy of clinicians (Thomas et al,, 2021). Data will be the driving for Al development: Internet users are the main contributor of data for Al. The materialisation of Al stock of Al knowledge for economic purposes is an innovation approach. Contextually , Cambodia requires strategic investment in the field if the kingdom wishes to unleash the potential of Al for socio-economic development: Some important investment could be financing, infrastructure development; talent development; and   supportive regulatory framework Three types of data are being collected for Al, which are identity data, network data, and behavior data (Ma; 2021). Identity Data refers to data of individual, entity, or identity or information characteristic to identify a person or institution. Network data refers to data of location from direct input to any application or usage of any particular application. Behavior data refers to data that users browse in websites, social media, Apps or in other application interfaces The three data are the important resources for Al. A triple helix model of market driven research on Al could be reiterated most of the discussion: The world is facing the rapid accumulation of knowledge on Al, while   private sector is harnessing the   potential of the field: However; consequences and various potential risks arising from this development has posed a great attention among policy makers and academic researchers, while private sector is in concern stage to materialise the development: Likewise, Cambodia is experiencing the rapid development of Al in the last decades_ The pool of knowledge in the field is growing fast in way that is unpredictable from user perspective. Practically, academia is seen to have challenges in coping with the demand of private sectors in the field. This rapid development and application of the field in industrylservices results in great attentions as well to policy makers Government regulator has generally acknowledged the significance of Al in economic development;, but privacy, security, ethics, and value are the major concern: After all it is necessary that Al landscape in Cambodia could be well understood prior to incentivise or regulate the development of the domain: 5.5.1. Scholarly publication From academic point of view Cambodia has seen the importance of investment in Al development. Some nascent publication of Al by Cambodian scholars seems to be since 2004. For instance, the first algorithm on swarm intelligence published (Hul et al,, 2007a; Hul et al,, 2007b; Seingheng et al.,2007; Tan et al., 2008). The work was published focusing mainly on water reuselrecycle in industrial sector: However, it seems no much progress in scholarly work; despite that the work 31

Page 47:

has great attentional in the later stage. Supper power economic drive like China, European Union, and United States has started to invest drastically in the research and development of Al from that time. The number of peer-reviewed paper and patents on Al has increased significantly in the last decade. Most of the papers are coming from higher education institutions The number of Al publication including journal articles, conference papers, repositories, patents, book chapters, book; thesis, and others are show below. The number of Al publication is seen more than two folds in the last ten years: The report by Center for Security and Emerging Technology in 2022 appears that journal papers share 51.5%  of all Al scholar documents   published: Pattern recognition contributed more than other fields of machine learning, computer vision, algorithm, data  mining; natural language processing, human computer interaction, control theory, and linguistics. 350 334.50 300 1 250 4 200 1 150 3 L 100 50 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Figure 4. Al publication trends in the last ten years (Center for Security and Emerging Technology, 2022) Al publication by sector shows that education predominate in the last ten years, while China shares largest number of publication and citation about Al. The huge contribution of Al knowledge from China could be attributed to large amount of data from users and the government policy to support the Al development in the country: In addition, hundreds of companies are opening up on Al investment. 32

Publication by sectors in the last ten years (Center for Security and Emerging Technology, 2022) Trends has commonly understood that Al-driven technologies are expected to be the stimulus for economic growth. Likewise, Cambodia values the importance of Al application as well. However; adoption, implementation and incentivised system are not sufficient enough  from academic studies in Cambodia society (S. Heng et al,, 2022). Scholars put an importance debate on value of Al on economic development. Some suggested that Al-enabled technologies for economic development in emerging growth nations could not simply happen until there is proper ecosystem. The foundation to adopt and adapt Al technologies for   developing economy   could be scientificlengineering-based education, sufficient infrastructure, favorable technology transfer mechanism; and others (Sayogo et al,, 2020). Further investment on Al-enabled technologies in education sector was also suggested (P. 2019). One of the first academic events was conducted entitled st annual forum on Al: Human intelligence in augmented era' with the aim to promote the field and its application. The event was arranged by Institute of Technology of Cambodia and Cambodia Development Resource Institute. Then; the forum was not made possible due to disruption of Covid-19. Finally, this important event was continued to commence again entitled ""2nd annual forum: Al for Society"" on August 10, 2022 at Cambodia University of Technology and  Science in collaboration with  Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology Innovation: This forum is organised to academia; private sectors, government, civil societies, and other relevant stakeholders to discuss the current development of Al, its future trends, and opportunities and challenges up ahead that Cambodia should prepare itself for if it decides to fully embrace such technology: The forum has five main objectives: Provide a platform for the representatives from the government;  industries and academia to discuss; express, and exchange ideas on the Al landscape and its impacts on society 33 Heng; bring

Page 49:

Raise public awareness of the significance , opportunities; benefits and challenges of Al applications Formulate policy suggestions and recommendations for promoting and strengthening the development of Industry 4.0 technologies in general, Al in particular Promote multi-stakeholder collaboration for knowledge mobilisation and development of artificial intelligence in Cambodia Disseminate the results of research studies on Artificial Intelligence Landscape in Cambodia: 5.5.2. Al Demand The application of Al is necessarily incorporated in industry and related public services. There is a need in synergising efforts from all stakeholders. An investment in Al for research universities is important: On the other hand, the private sector and public institutions could bring actual Al- enabled  technologies to fit the demand for research universities: Research and innovation ecosystem of Al in the countries could be suggested as fellow (S. et al., 2022). University level: Required motived and qualified researchers on Al, intra and inter collaboration among researchers and institutions, lessening redundancy work, Joint research efforts Private sector level: Setting up task force, using case-driven approaches, solution- driven adoption process Government level: Required funding for research and development, clear approaches and strategy, centralisation of the Al activities: Coordinating underlies foundation the Al research and development: Existing policy such as National policy on STI 2020-2030, Cambodia's STI roadmap 2030, Cambodia Digital Economy and Society Policy framework 2021-2035, could be some of legal instruments to unleash the potential of Al for useful purposes. Breaking the silo among all stakeholders is the immediate actions to ensure that Al ecosystem is connected for socio-economic development of the nation National council of science, technology & innovation is the big umbrella serving as platform to accommodate stakeholders: 5.6. Potential Al applications for different sectors 5.6.1. Service Over the last few decades, the number of internet users increase rapidly over the world wide web. In the current era of internet; large amount of data has been generated every day whenever you are watching TV, using social media, doing online shopping and communication: As the speed of internet access is getting incredibly faster from end-to-end users; the new advance technologies 34 Heng

Page 50:

such as loTs, Big data analytics, Al, have been possibly introduced to better benefit the human life. Due to this reason, numerous of companies seek to adopt these advance technologies to create more creative services from day to day to their end user. This process could be possible by collecting and analysing the data generated from the past experience of their customers and, thus, it could deliver the related services according to their interests and needs: Let's take a look on how the Al technology has the impact on everyday life as following: a Retail and E-commerce With the development of the e-commerce, the scale of online retail is becoming larger and larger: Within the variety of product categories and changeable customer demand, it is a very big challenge for the sale  volume   prediction: In the modern Al is   applied to tackle the aforementioned problems: Chen in 2020 proposed an online retail prediction using machine learning called AGA-LSTM Neural Network. The adaptive genetic algorithm is applied while the building of neural network to optimised the training time and prediction accuracy. As a result, the method could forecast the sale volume of goods in a very large and complicated e-commerce. b_ Online Advertising In the world of the digital marketing, many companies try to improve their business strategy by promoting and   diversifying their  products and  services via many methods and one of the promising one is online advertising: The problem is how does the company actually know about which ads the customer is interested in. In fact; Al is already there to solve this problem. Normally , most of the website have implemented the tracking code to keep log file of browsing behavior of individual (Neumann, 2016). This information is shared across different companies and, thus, the historic behavior about the user interest of which site you visit or which product you looked at were being captured. During this process, Al is used to match the users to the corresponding ads based on the analysing of this historic behavior: C Customer Support Customer support is the very effective way used in any company to help the customer when thing goes wrong eg-, when user want to know detail about the way the use the product properly, would call and ask  Traditionally, most companies spend a lot of moneys to create customer service department as the prompt and accurate response to a request is very essential for customer retention and satisfaction (Molino et al,, 2018). Yet; this procedure could lead to change of worker practices as the users expect to ask for time availability of the information about their orders or to answer a very simple questions such as ""why is my internet connection dead"" (Hardalov et al,, 2018). Many of Al application have been proposed such as voice recognition , sentimental analysis (Kaur, 2018), etc, in order to understand the customer's question and give 35 day, they

Page 51:

the accurate response e.g , nowadays, people are most likely to use Alexa, Siri or google assistance for online shopping; controlling home devices etc. 5.6.2. Manufacturing Manufacturing sector has played an important role for the country by contributing to employment growth, national security, sustainable development which improve the economic potential and GDP of the country: With the emerging technologies such as inter-communication (loT, CPS), smart visualisation and decision making (Al, Big data, Cloud Computing) and Cyber security it has enabled the transformation of the manufacturing in terms of the model; approach and its ecosystem. The life cycle of manufacturing in the new era requires a lot of processes and technologies. Generally, the procedure uses the autonomous sensing; inter-connection, decision- making, control, and the execution of human; machine, material, and environment information to integrate and optimise various aspects of manufacturing: Therefore, it would help to facilitate the production and to produce high efficiency and quality , cost-effective, environment friendly for users, and to improve the competitiveness in the manufacturing market. In addition (Qu et al., 2019) , the evolution of smart manufacturing is not only to develop new technology, but one must also define the requirements of stakeholders and the model of innovative business. Technically, this process would help get real-time data to improve the accuracy of decision-making in the supply process (Mass Customisation) , enhance the efficiency and performance of the production line process (plant automation) , minimise the used resources (raw material) , waste management and increase the overall productivity. Al, which is computer system able to perform task that generally mimic to the human intelligence, is one of the main key drivers in this change as it would help in forwarding the sustainable development (Buchmeister et al., 2019). Thus, Al is a very important factor to transform the traditional manufacturing into advance and smart manufacturing in the context of fourth industrial revolution. a_ Smart Warehouse management system Traditionally; warehouse is used to store the manufactured products from one or many places and deliver them to the company customer. Due to the rapid increasing amounts of orders in the modern day, the distribution process in the warehouse is getting more complicated and led to the birth of the smart warehouse management system. According to study there are five main steps in the complete product distribution process which consists in planning, receiving and put away, location management, order picking and packing, and transport and tracking: By introducing Al concept, each step can be analysed and optimised separately (Zunic et al,, 2018). Study by Pulungan et al. in 2013 provides some brief discussions on the practical implementation of artificial intelligent into warehouse management system. The research mentioned on to use new technologies such as bee colony optimisation, fussy controlling, extreme learning machine along the Radio Frequency Identification. All of the aforementioned technologies are used to 36 flow how

Page 52:

enable the intelligent logistic  system, intelligent warehouse   system, real-time   transportation monitoring system, sales forecasting system and intelligent sales summary system (Pulungan et al., 2013). b_ Manufacturing Production Since the beginning of the industrial revolution 4.0 (I4.0) , many countries have already address it as modern challenge in various fields   especially in the  advance industrial  manufacturing (Kagermann et al, 2011). This transformation of advanced industrial manufacturing could be made through digitalisation and exploitation of new advanced technology such as self-learning and self-adapting cyber physical system (CPS) , loTs, cloud computing and Al. Their primary goal is to address the need of modern production system with higher  efficiency and lower cost throughout the process so that it could meet new demand in the modern market: To tackle the problems, numerous of enterprises have already investigated and implemented by using all of these aforementioned technologies. To be competitive under the paradigm of |4.0, a company must production planning and control (PPC) able to respond to disturbance (Cadavid et al,, 2019). Normally, PPC can be defined as the required quantity in the plant production to meet profitability, productivity and on-time delivery: To satisfy the requirement; the author introduce the Al technology by using text mining to estimate the production inhibition time and machine learning techniques to create the dynamic production schedule in the production line. On the other hand, the aim of smart manufacturing is to achieve highly flexible and automate in the production process (Hsieh et al,, 2019). The use case of the paper is to detect the anomaly of production line in smart manufacturing by using the collected data from the sensing device: They introduce a new Al algorithm called unsupervised real-time anomaly detection based on LSTM-based Auto- Encoder . 5.6.3. Mobility and Transportation Mobility and transportation are known as the backbones of the modern economy and function in one country to become intelligent: They are a driven force to promote economic growth, enhance the accessibility of the labor market; strengthen the logistics supply chain, and open up new markets for enterprises due to their linkages to other sectors. According to the Japan International Cooperation Agency report on the modernisation of vehicle registration in 2019, the number of registered vehicles and motorcycles has increased exponentially. The growth rate in 2013 was approximately 84%. This growth leads to primary emissions, then the smart moves of the mobility and transportation sector must be required to achieve environmental sustainability and a new mobility ecosystem. 37

Page 53:

New mobility and transportation technologies currently take Al as the significant perspective, transforming conventional transportation into intelligent transportation The potential Al applications on mobility and transportation can be enabled as follows, a_ Advanced driver assistance   systems and automated driving  systems: this autonomous technology can enable vehicles, trains, roads, and other infrastructure to communicate with computers, smartphones, or other devices via wireless technologies Al capabilities can help increase safety, reliability, and hauling efficiency. For example, autonomous driving systems are designed to offer drivers some functions such as monitoring;  warning;  braking, and  steering  functions: The potential of Al can be analysed to predict the end ofthe queue to generate a queue warning message to allow the vehicle to take action: b Cybersecurity: Al is built in cybersecurity to   provide high security of technologies applied in modern transportation to achieve   efficient operations and prevent any thread interruption. Precisely, those automated systems that connected vehicles,  devices, and infrastructure operating together are needed to embed Al technology to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the systems by identifying the threadslmalware, preventing the damage resources C Accessible transportation: This system uses Al to support all travelers, including the elderly or people with disabilities The system consists of many target functions related to transportation, such as pre-trip planning, wayfinding and navigation, surface street crossing, and navigating the complex road. In addition, the auto curb ramp system is also installed in the vehicle or other transportation as an assistant to help the disabled and older adults. Al can also promote reliability and safety execute one travel to all links in the travel chain to make it easy for users to access: d_ Traveler decision  support tools: The   potential Al-enabled   applications   provide adequate   monitoring information to process passenger  requests   (weatherlpricing information) , predict the roadway; arrival times, and other valuable functions such as planning trips: For instance, the transportation system managers can also use the information in the system to support decision-making: Transportation systems management and operations: The optimisation of multimodal infrastructure systems using Al is built to perform real-time and dynamic service   systems to improve the  transportation   system. Decision-making is also considered in this management system to control the work zone, traffic incident, road weather , or other traffic signals: 38 cyber

Page 54:

f . Commercial vehicle and freight  operations: Al is embedded to address the operation and movement of vehicle and freight management systems. For example, Al is applied in asset tracking, cargo status monitoring, freight optimisation, freight signals, etc , to ensure management efficiency and safety: g Transit   operations and management: This   system uses Al to perform the management;  operations, maintenance, and security to respond to many services, including maintenance forecasting; event detection, dynamic itinerary planning, and service allocation: This system helps the user monitor and select the service to apply for transit vehicles: h_ Emergency management: This is a particular system that uses Al to build the alert agency system to address public transportation safety management: The system covers the necessary alerts, such as policies, fire, and emergency medical. Air traffic management: To optimise air traffic pathway management, Al needs to use the available data to generalise the pathway and provide real-time visualisation of the traffic management system. J Remote sensing: Drone and uncrewed aerial vehicles have functioned as intelligent remote sensing; which uses Al to monitor and control the traffic, bridge inspections, aerial mapping; incident management, and transportation infrastructure. k_ Asset management and roadway construction and maintenance: This system focus on the strategic and systematic process of operating, maintaining, and improving physical assets by using Al application. The prediction of Al can identify a structured sequence of maintenance, preservation, rehabilitation; and replacement actions that requires taking action at a minimum feasible cost. In summary; there are four system functions enabled by Al in the mobility and transportation sector: Sense and perceive the environment Reason and analyse information Learn from the experience and adapt to new situations Make decisions, communicate, and take actions. The Al-enable application is checked with four maturity levels: concept; R&D, prototype or minimum viable product; and production. Consequently, there are three aspects of Al-enabled application: The increased levels of comfort and convenience 39

The prospect of vastly improved safety through autonomous driving The macro benefits to the environment (e.g;, potential reduction of emissions) and society (e.g , potential optimisation of traffic less required parking space in city centers)  5.6.4. Agriculture The agricultural sector is one of Cambodia's 2030 roadmap priorities for technology development options. Besides, agriculture had gained 22 percent of Cambodias GDP and employed about 3 million people in 2018, according to a report by the US Embassy in Cambodia: Currently, agriculture technology has rapidly transformed to use advanced machinery and internet of thing technology to analyse and enhance production efficiency. The potential Al applications in the agriculture sector can provide into six categories: a Agricultural production management: Al is enabled in the agricultural production management system to provide information about crop rotation planning, planting time consumption, water and nutrient management; pests and fertilisers and management, disease control, optimal harvest; food marketing; product distribution; food safety, and food supply chain tasks b Agricultural production management: Al is enabled in the agricultural production management system to provide information about crop rotation planning, planting time consumption, water and nutrient management; pests and fertilisers and management, disease control, optimal harvest; food marketing, product distribution, food safety, and food supply chain tasks C Crop monitoring: This system applies Al to monitor and identify crop health issues, soil nutrients, weather conditions, irrigation, and other functions that maximise crop revenue. The Al-enabled application provides visual instruction and quickly understands soil health, plant pests, and plant disease d_ Data science: The agriculture information is stored at all data points every day for further analysis: For example, weather conditions, temperature, irrigation, and soil conditions data are collected from the farm to enable an Al model to predict the plant condition whether it will produce high quality or not. Real-time data provides a better understanding of the health of plants and optimise natural resources. This approach produces agroecosystem dynamics under changing environmental conditions Disease detection: The Al-enabled tool is applied to provide the early-warning system to prevent disease outbreaks and spotting insectslanimals in the area of plants Al can also trigger the sensor to take action to protect the plant 40 flow,

Page 56:

f . Food quality: Food safety and quality assurance use Al as a critical role to perform most human tasks to check the plant g Predictive analytics: potential Al application is performed as data analysis to help farmers protect the land quality , reduce water irrigation, and determine the amount of crop harvested: The prediction is expected to increase the profitability for each field while reducing the environmental impact of pesticides and fertiliser In summary, Al will drive the agricultural revolution to an intelligent agricultural ecosystem and sustainability. 5.6.5. Education Throughout the ages, countries have seen the profound impact of education on their quality of life (Psacharopoulos & Patrinos 2004). With that in mind, nothing could be more transformative than providing consistent  high-quality education across Cambodia's population. And these promising advancements are actually more possible than ever through the use of artificial intelligence with its adaptive algorithms As a matter of fact; this new technology is already being used in many classrooms around the world and online to help facilitate learning through virtual and individualised educational platforms: And given how respected teachers currently are in Cambodia; improving teachers' impact has become a top priority for Cambodian leadership. After all, today's students will become tomorrow's leaders that will advance Cambodia's future. Cambodian culture values hard work; dedication, and family all of which make for students that are capable of many amasing accomplishments. However; given the financial, geographic, and demographic constraints, providing quality education has been a challenge. That being said, AI and its direct application to facilitate learning has the potential to transform Cambodia's education system and substantially raise the quality of life for millions of citizens. In the future, this technology will facilitate the implementation of standardised learning in which the lessons for each student will be based on their capabilities and hard work, not on the limitations of their geographic situation: But delivering on these promises requires focused planning and execution by the leadership of Cambodia: Currently; however, Al in education is far from the  envisioned science fiction avatar that seamlessly interacts with young students. As things are now, Al remains in the nascent stages of development: Still, many scholars believe that there will be   comprehensive educational applications that work  directly with students. These applications will   understand what each student needs; providing lessons that focus on what exactly the student must focus on to reach the next educational milestone. 41 The

Page 57:

Far before the previously mentioned avatar begins teaching our children, educators will be relying on Al to facilitate the traditional classroom setting: In fact, most current applications of Al in the classroom help teachers understand where students need specialised lessons or individualised training: Al is  helping teachers build Smart Content; automate   tutoring, grade tests, and categorise learning difficulties: This saves time for the teachers, allowing them to focus on the more substantial aspects of teaching such as lesson planning and student engagement (e.g: Al in Education) (Faggella; 2019). modern examples of Al in education have emerged in countries all over the world. One notable example is China's initiative called Education Informatisation 2.0 Digital First Education:' One of the first initiatives in this program was to upgrade the curriculum by improving the availability of resources for teachers. To this end, they built a ""shared resource"" platform which makes teachers more productive by providing a well organised digital space for resources that have been collected from all over the country (e.g: Education Informatisation 2.0 in China: Motivation, Framework, and Vision, an exploration into Innovative Practices of Targeted Poverty Reduction Through Education using Information Technology) (Yan & Yang; 2021). Artificial Intelligence will have a similar impact on most other industries as well. Additionally, the technology itself is an industry that will provide many opportunities for students that are capable of learning how to use these new tools. Some examples include deep learning; statistical analysis; and robotics. Cambodian students will undoubtedly have a distinct advantage in using these new technologies: This will in turn help  Cambodia realise the educational   promise of   artificial intelligence. 5.6.6. Finance and Trade Cambodia's GDP growth rate has been extremely stable over time and is now the sixth fastest growing economy in the world: What is unique about this growth is that it has been steady for over 20 years (See GDP Chart): The World Economic Forum has reported that only 13 economies worldwide have provided this level of stable growth. This is a sign of resilience and consistency in the country: It is also a sign that Cambodia has the discipline and drive to implement new solutions and technological innovations regularly. And artificial intelligence will be yet another solution that helps Cambodia thrive in the future (World Economic Forum, 2016). 42 Many

Cambodia's GDP capacity during last decade (World Bank, 2023) As the economy emerges and takes off; it is imperative that its financial sector continues facilitating investment flow while domestic credits pick up. Given such opportunities, Al technology would find its place in effectively accelerating financial inclusion through its machine-learning innovations that enable more accessible and default-free credit models: 1onon :00n Note: This charts will be redone by The art tcam. 6000 4nnn z00n 2017 2018 2019 2020 SOURCE: TRADINGECONOMICSCOM NATIONAL BANK OF CAMBODIA Figure 7 . Cambodia's export behavior Trade is a major reason for why Cambodia's GDP growth has had such sustained development. Improving trade is directly correlated with improving the economy in Cambodia: The better the trade, the better the economy: And artificial intelligence has much to offer when it comes to bettering trade and remaining competitive in tomorrow's international market. As the chart shows, exports are continuing to rise with apparel, footwear, and leather goods being the major drivers of growth. A continued focus on these exports and experimenting with new exports will help 43

Cambodia thrive in already fertile markets such as the USA, China, and Germany as shown in figure above. Al provides many opportunities for efficiency and growth in the world market: For example, the implementation of Al for language translation in e-commerce has been shown to produce more than 17% growth in online international trade sales (Brynjolfsson et al., 2019). And there are other such examples in which Al tools are capable of managing compliance despite the numerous complexities between suppliers, clients , and   shifting trade restrictions: Without Al, many industries rely on mere human intervention to constantly check for errors However; by using Al, the system can learn how to handle these problems more efficiently and accurately, which in turn allows for a more seamless compliance operation.

Cambodia export by contry Al is also making a significant contribution by optimising the supply chain: The significant lead time required for many supply operations can derail trade operations by causing a myriad of time delays, especially when there are complex multipart orders. The ordering of one part might mean the ordering of sixty different other parts, all with different lead times. Getting ahead of these orders is to delivering your products on time: similarly  significant capability of this technology is the implementation of Al based  smart contracts. This is where the legal contract is essentially broken down into computer code in which business rules are implemented, which then allows Al to avoid any costly mistakes while reducing manual checking: These factors all lead to easier access to trade and financing because the business investors are more confident in a process that they can measure and trust: As more countries continue to implement Al for international trade, the compatibility of such technology across different countries would mean better communication, efficiency, and fairness in international dealings. For example, a smaller country might feel more comfortable in a deal in 44 key

which all of its factors are being considered and intentionally maximised in discussions with larger countries that have more resources. And wealthier countries will have the chance to better international relations and improve the quality of life in smaller countries with Al handling the nuances for both sides The overall benefits of implementing Al in negotiations are that each side can move faster; have deeper confidence, and feel more comfortable with the outcomes The is having a system that each party can trust and that can illuminate alternatives that might have otherwise been unthought of by both sides (Hone, 2019). This is how Al becomes sewn into the fabric of international trade. And while it does not completely replace the process or the people, it is still implemented in almost every component, delivering an improved trading operation: These improvements will be realised right to the bottom line in Cambodia, thereby driving the GDP to even higher levels (Nesbitt; 2017)_ 5.6.7. Healthcare and Medicine Healthcare is one of the most important areas for the use of Al. Cambodia has already begun working with companies that utilise various levels of diagnostic technologies embedded with Al. For example, CARA has tools that help   diagnose eye and cardiovascular disease in Cambodia: This is just the beginning: Artificial intelligence has the capability for use in almost every area of healthcare from diagnostics, surgery, operational  efficiencies, and population disease projection analytics (Davenport & Kalakota, 2019). Future opportunities include smart hospitals where equipment and infrastructure are embedded with contact sensors that bring a hospital's architecture to a level of ambient intelligence. These tools have provided new levels of protection for clinical professionals and safety for patients by interpreting their surroundings and gathering additional relevant data for clinicians (Standford University, 2021). The development of such artificial intelligence in healthcare has undergone many evolutions: In the early 80s, logic systems consisting of  if-then-else statements and massive rules-base engineering were defined as a type of intelligence: However, diagnostic professionals found these tools to be overwhelmingly complex and difficult to manage. One of the primary challenges was keeping the current knowledge base up-to-date, especially if the recommendation engine was providing dosage calculations: Also, rule engines typically consisted of hundreds and thousands of statements, all of which were largely error-prone and hardly classifiable in today's modern AI engines (Davenport & Kalakota; 2019). (The potential for artificial intelligence in healthcare) Most of today's Al technology is based on neural networks and deep learning: Such technology allows machines to perform tasks without specifically being programmed to do so. In this way, computers can learn from data and perform tasks in a more human-friendly way: AII kinds of problems are being efficiently handled by Al in the medical field. For instance, the massive amount of data doctors has to analyse when diagnosing a patient is typically colossal. 45 key

Page 61:

Health records are spread across multiple systems and do not follow any standard protocol. But Al tools bring all of the data together; then these tools analyse the structured and unstructured results to produce probabilistic diagnostics that can help the doctor quickly identify a potential illness: In addition to   diagnostics, artificial intelligence is also becoming common in treatment recommendations and avoiding medical errors With the massive amount of data available each year, it is difficult or impossible for all clinical professionals to be up-to-date on the potential treatment   regimens for uncommon diagnoses. An  empirical explaining this medical challenge has been done using modern machine-learning algorithms in the Cambodian Children's hospital (Oonsivilai et al,,2018). This study focused on the patient's antibiotic susceptibility based on patient-specific predictions. The result from the study outperformed the logistic regression models and has proved itself to be very beneficial when it comes to issuing prescriptions since it can prevent the inappropriate overuse of antibiotics, thereby reducing the patient's resistance to antibiotic treatment: Every year more medical articles are produced than could ever be read by one person. In 2012 nearly 2 million scientific articles were published, and that trend has grown 3% every year (Chi; 2013). Furthermore, it has been well documented that patient allergy management; dangerous drug-to-drug interactions, and dealing with other complex medical conditions have yielded a risky environment for patients But Al tools can quickly digest the latest articles and recalculate potential treatment plans almost instantaneously: This helps safeguard patients by providing clinicians with focused, uncluttered   information. Al is also being used to help clinical professionals more accurately and effectively identify medical treatments with the best probability of success: For example, IBM Watson reads the patient's medical record and then determines the likelihood of a stroke, it then provides the potential success of a variety of different treatments (IBM, 2018). Surgical robots have also been assisting clinicians for decades: But recently these robots are being embedded with AI: This is largely seen in common surgeries such as gynecologic and prostate procedures. Such technology helps the surgeon focus on more complex matters while removing much of the basic logistics of the operation (Davenport & Kalakota, 2019). Surgeons are also using Al to help keep track of all the relevant factors in their decision-making: These factors include the values and emotions of the patient, case complexity, individual judgment; and time constraints. Bringing Al tools into the surgical decision-making process helps clarify all the factors of these decisions within an objective framework: Patients thereby end up with a better outcome when both human and automated decision-making come together over their surgical procedures (Loftus et al,, 2020). 46 study

5.7. Challenges Al is currently used extensively in commercial applications like targeting advertisements, search optimisation, customer service, healthcare, transportation, and the robotic applications that have been previously explained in this article. The basic technological principles for implementing these systems have been around for decades, but the computational power and clean data necessary to implement these ideas have only recently become feasible. The most promising aspect of this implementation is supervised learning: This provides the foundation for many of the most practical examples of Al in business (McKinsey Global Institute, 2018). However, there are many challenges and concerns that come with the use of Al. Certainly, machine learning requires massive amounts of data and computing time. Researchers are generally challenged when it comes to finding high-quality, unbiased training sets to teach AI. In many cases, hundreds of thousands, if not millions of records are required to properly implement deep learning algorithms. And data sets containing biased information can lead to undesirable results: Most algorithms and data sets need to be tuned to the appropriate objective and all algorithms need to be tested to make sure the results are correct and appropriate. Every effort should be made for data to be stored in a usable format and be well documented so it can be appropriately applied in a learning model. Data manipulation alone is one of the most expensive and time- consuming parts of any Al project. There are other cultural challenges to consider that branch out into new issues for leadership when it comes to incorporating Al. A cautious yet experimental mindset is necessary for this new technology enterprise to be successful. Errors are natural and even helpful for our understanding: Although sometimes the cost in time and money might increase, it should still be considered a milestone for progress Governments and companies hoping to use Al also need to focus on innovation, critical thinking, and STEM in their educational system: External subject matter experts will certainly be able to help with data formatting and processing algorithms: However , experts who understand the underlying data and principles of how the information might be best used are in a position to maximise the impact and profitability of this new technology (Mackinsey Global Institute , 2018)_ In addition to the challenges faced by leadership, data quality, and bias, is also held back by computing power and infrastructure: Specifically, Al implementation is hampered by the lack of available talent and intellectually skilled practitioners, not to mention financing: In many areas funding is not available to test applications or even to provide the time to consider how these new solutions might be applied. In the short term, this research takes time and money. But in the run; the potential benefits will far outweigh the investment (Mackinsey Global Institute, 2018). 47 key AI long

there has been much written about how Al will take jobs away from unskilled or easily automated workers. This can especially be seen in Cambodia where industries are still labor intensive (An; 2020) and have low economy-of-scale in terms of market size. This means that most of these industries would not allow Cambodian businesses to afford advanced automated and robotic machines that are made available by Al technology: This typically leads to hesitation to invest and experiment with Al: However; Al brings other opportunities, especially in the early stages of transition: One example in education involves the potential confusion between the student and the Al program's design: The implementation of Al based learning systems in China; for example, required the hiring of hundreds of ""tutors"" to help students during the implementation of their lessons: And 70% of these positions were filled by women who would have otherwise gone unemployed (Xinxin et al,, 2019). The transition to Al for a country or a company will not be simple and seamless: There are and will be advances in some areas and challenges in others The foundation of Al demands hard work in infrastructure and normal Information; as well as Communication Technology (ICT): But Cambodia has already been implementing a plan to fortify these fundamental infrastructure components (SEAN & LOR, 2020). There have been many famous examples that show how Al can make errors and provide misleading answers during this transition. One famous example is Google's ""GFE, which is short for ""Google Flu Trends:' It was an experimental tool that was intended to predict flu outbreaks in the United States. Initial results seemed promising; but unfortunately, it was determined that the data was unreliable in its predictions and the project was terminated: Other examples include the Microsoft Chat Bot that was making sexist and racist statements. It was shut down within 24 hours of operation: There was also the Amazon Al hiring blunder where selections that had been in use for years were clearly biased: None of these errors negate the fact that Al is a powerful technology that is here to stay. Improvements in the algorithms and data sets will undoubtedly drive positive performance in the future (Tennery & Cherelus, 2016). Healthcare diagnostics and procedural processes with Al have also been successfully deployed: However, widespread use of Al to displace caregivers is unlikely in the short-term, and perhaps in the long term. This is because of the tremendous shortage in clinical professionals in Cambodia and around the world. Additionally, Al is seen as a diagnostic helper, but will probably never be a tool to deliver a diagnosis. Patients tend to prefer face-to-face dialogue around their diagnoses and potential treatment options. Therefore; although Al can be extremely helpful and even necessary to ease the burden of clinical diagnostics, it will not be a replacement (Davenport Kalakota; 2019). In many situations; the output and associated logical explanation of Al has not been made clear: For example, educational Al has been struggling to build models that allow students to learn in 48 Also,

Page 64:

steps: It has been well documented that  porting curriculum content into usable Al-based frameworks is challenging and expensive. Also, identifying laddering technologies that serve to identify students' level of understanding has additional complexities. For example, a student that understands to do addition but  struggles with   multiplication naturally needs   specific, individualised attention in multiplication. This requires lessons to be linked in a sophisticated manner that is machine readable and integrated across curriculums: Implementing a 'knowledge tree' for such students involves an efficient network of lessons that require advanced skills, an in-depth knowledge of databases, and a solid understanding of the interplay within such systems to see how the Al model will respond to the sum total of its overall usage. Fortunately, there are many working examples of well planned and executed Al based learning engines. One example is the system implemented in China to help non-native speakers learn Mandarin. The system has an Al-based engine that engages the students and determines their level of   comprehension. Then it continuously adjusts their   experience to maximise understanding: Students using this system have shown significantly improved test results (Xinxin et al,,2019). Cybersecurity and   confidentiality are also major challenges for Al, particularly when the information is clinical or financially related: The implementation of Al also raises confidentiality and intellectual property (IP) issues. Training data often needs to be copied and edited for use, which may lead to a certain degree of vulnerability: With that in mind, cybersecurity should be a completely integral part of every Al project in order to properly consider the necessary protocols for  safety, security , and protecting intellectual property, as well as safeguarding  personal information. Regular testing and audits are required to ensure a safe and secure environment: Furthermore, proper data governance, threat detection, and legal review should be fundamental to any technological project (Oseni et al,, 2021). In Cambodia; this technology is not just about Al. It is about creating a digital framework within the existing infrastructure to implement its learning capability  alongside the work of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). A relevant legal  framework on data and cybersecurity is also needed to be in force to combat cybercrimes and to also provide assurance to relevant businesses, practitioners, and consumers in the field: Infrastructure is the and there is already a basic technological foundation that Cambodia has been building for years that will be leveraged to maximise the impact of Al in education (SEAN & LOR, 2020). Recently, the Royal Government of Cambodia has put forth in its Cambodia Digital Economy and Society Policy Framework 2021-2035 specific measures within the short and medium term of its plan to boost investment in infrastructure and the application of Al in data governance, particularly in data use and analysis (Royal Government  of Cambodia, 2021). However , to effectively use Al, an environment of experimentation and  innovation is necessary: Basic 49 how key;

Page 65:

research and prototyping are required. But proper leadership and guidance for such objectives are also necessary to purposely direct this technology in a way that solves real problems for Cambodia: technological projects have suffered from weak leadership and misguided objectives: But constant measurement, objective evaluation, and experimenting with potential solutions are necessary in avoiding such issues: The current reality of Al is undoubtedly promising: And the truth is that Al is already producing positive results that are used daily in business, clinical, and mechanical settings Far from magic, the   technology is math-intensive and   requires highly skilled   professionals for planning; implementation, assessment;, and continuous monitoring/teedback to ensure appropriate results. And while the initial stages of development are error-prone, the daily use of successfully implemented Al platforms is simple and extremely reliable. Even nOW, Al continues to prove its worth despite the challenges of its development: But that being said, the most important key to its success is good leadership that realises the undeniable benefits Al has in store for Cambodia. 6_ Al for Cambodia: Policy framework and options Artificial Intelligence (Al) is one of the essential technologies in the world game changing in every sector to improve productivity, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. In order to foster trustworthy Al ecosystems, it is essential for countries to develop human-centered policies that promote socio- economic and responsible Al research and development: This includes policies that encourage investment in such initiatives: These policies of Al development should take into account its national development vision as well as regional and global trends: The country's objectives; preferences, and overarching strategy for Al advancement in both immediate and distant future should be clarified. Initially, the main objective is to cultivate skilled personnel and employ Al solutions to deal with critical national focus areas that will have a swift impact on Cambodia's socio-economic  status_ Over  time , the priority should shift  to developing  fundamental and advanced research; promoting high-level Al research and innovation, and   establishing Cambodia's standing in advanced technology on a global scale To reach this goal, here are some policy recommendations for Cambodia: 6.1 . Define National Focus Areas Cambodia has experienced a significant increase in internet users as part of its pursuit to become digital nation. These users employ the internet for various reasons such as entertainment; work, and business growth. Consequently, innovative technologies like loTs, Big data analytics, and AI are increasingly becoming prevalent in Cambodia's daily activities. To maximize this technological advancement; Cambodia should prioritize the utilization of Al in developmental sectors: These sectors should be carefully selected to ensure that they align with the country's overall development goals. The recommendations areas should include: 50 Many key key

Page 66:

Service for SME: with the rapid growth of internet users, many businesses are eager to adopt advanced technologies that can enhance customer experiences and drive business growth. One way to achieve this is by collecting and analyzing data from customers' past experiences, which can help companies deliver  relevant  services based on their preferences and needs To leverage these technologies effectively, the policies should focus on areas such as retail and e-commerce, online advertising; and customer support Manufacturing: the of Cambodia's GDP has been significantly influenced by its manufacturing sector. To further enhance productivity and cost-effectiveness in manufacturing and keep up with the fourth industrial revolution; implementation of Al can help transform traditional manufacturing into advanced and smart manufacturing: This, in turn; will enable Cambodia to compete effectively in regional and global markets, leading to positive socio-economic progress: The integration of   technology in manufacturing can involve real-time data collection through loT, automation processes using robotics, and improved daily operations and decision-making through information systems and AI: Mobility and Transportation: transportation and mobility is a significant factor in stimulating economic growth, improving market accessibility, strengthening logistics supply chains, and creating new opportunities for businesses by connecting different sectors. Introducing Al to improve the efficiency and accessibility of transportation and mobility can aid Cambodia in achieving its environmental sustainability, road safety, and socio-economic  objectives. To effectively implement Al in transportation, it is crucial to focus on improving transport   accessibility, management and  operation systems, emergency response management; security measures, and roadway maintenance and management Agriculture: in 2018, agriculture contributed 22% to Cambodia's GDP and provided employment opportunities to around 3 million individuals. With the advancements in technology, the agricultural sector has rapidly evolved and incorporated sophisticated machinery and internet of things technology to enhance production efficiency. Given that Cambodia is primarily an agricultural-based country, the implementation of Al for enhancing agricultural productivity is imperative: The potential applications of Al in agriculture include managing production; monitoring crop growth, analyzing data and making informed decisions, detecting diseases, monitoring food quality and safety, and conducting predictive analysis. Education: providing consistent; high-quality education to its citizens will a significant impact on both people's lifestyles, well-being and the country's economic growth. In today's digital age, Al and other technologies have revolutionized the way we teach and learn. Despite potential challenges, these applications offer immense 51 key growth bring

Page 67:

benefits for transforming education. However, since technology accessibility is still limited in some regions of Cambodia due to socio-economic and geographic factors: Therefore , to maximize the of Al in education requires improving three main strategies: 1) improve digital infrastructure and funding to accessibility to technology for   every student; 2) providing clear national   policies and guidelines on the implementation of Al in teaching and learning activities, and 3) using technology to make learning contents accessible to all students regardless of their location. Finance and Trade: in order for Cambodia's economy to continue its growth trajectory, it is   crucial that the financial sector keeps facilitating investment   flow while also supporting domestic credits. The country's sustained development in terms of GDP growth can be attributed to trade; which plays a significant role in boosting the economy: Therefore, enhancing trade is directly linked to improving the overall economy of Cambodia. In this context; leveraging the potential of artificial intelligence can prove to be advantageous in terms of enhancing finance, trade and maintaining competitiveness in the global market of the future Al tools can be implemented in finance and trend analysis to enhance various aspects of businesses such as international trade through automatic  language   translation,  ensuring compliance with regulations, providing efficient customer support, creating customer profiles for targeted marketing; optimizing the supply chain management; and executing smart contracts. Healthcare: access to high-quality healthcare is crucial for the overall well-being and development of a country, and it should be a top priority in every nation's development goals. Artificial intelligence (Al) is playing an increasingly important role in healthcare worldwide, and Cambodia is already working with companies that use Al-powered diagnostic technologies The potential applications of Al in healthcare are vast, from diagnostics and surgery to operational efficiencies and population disease projection analytics and   prediction: To  prevent medical errors, Cambodia should consider implementing smart hospitals where   technology is integrated into equipment; infrastructure, and processes to enhance diagnosis and treatment  Tourism: Tourism is a significant contributor to Cambodia's economy; with around 11.3 million domestic and 6.61 million international tourists visiting in 2019 prior to the Covid- 19 pandemic. However; in 2022, only 2.2 million international visitors were recorded, highlighting the impact of the pandemic on travel: Therefore, it has become essential to utilize technology as a means to enhance tourism activities and help the industry recover. 6.2. Develop a National Al Regulation and Guidelines Al has the potential to bring numerous benefits to society and the economy, but it also carries significant risks and responsibilities, particularly regarding privacy, ethics, and security. 52 profit

Page 68:

To ensure that Al applications prioritize human-centered benefits, Cambodia must develop regulations and guidelines by a multi-ministries committee: The committee shall consist  of the Ministry of Industry,  Science ,  Technology & Innovation; Ministry of Post and Telecommunication and Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport: This new regulation and guidelines require harmonizing existing laws and creating new data protection laws that govern sensitive personal information throughout its lifecycle, from capture to storage, sharing, use, and archiving: To safeguard citizens' privacy, organizations of all sizes including academia should adopt a privacy-by-design approach to developing Al applicationslalgorithms The multi-ministries committee should also oversee the proper incorporation of ethics and privacy measures in Al development to ensure compliance with best practices 6.3. Develop a National Al Infrastructure In order for Al to be fully utilized, it is crucial to have a strong infrastructure that supports the development and implementation of Al systems  This infrastructure should be initiated by the government with the support from private industries and academia. This infrastructure shall be used to support students, researchers, universities, and industries in their pursuit of Al innovation: It shall consider various components such as hardware, software, data, and human resources that are necessary for the research and deployment of Al solutions: Essential components of this infrastructure may include high-performance computing systems, cloud-based platforms for data storage and processing, and open-source AI frameworks and libraries: 6.4. Promote in Al Research, Innovation, Education and Talent development The future is expected to see the integration of emerging technologies such as big data, cloud computing; cyber security, data science, Al, robotics, 3D printing; Blockchain, and Internet of Things (loTs) across various industries  including  businesses, healthcare,  agriculture, and education: Talent and skill development: Cambodia faces a shortage of highly skilled workers in these areas, which highlights the need for educational reforms to equip students with modern skill sets that align with the demands of the future labor market: In addition, one of draw-back when using Al is job displacement To tackle this challenge, the government can prioritize and support talent and skill development initiatives. These could be: 53

Page 69:

Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport shall encourage educational institutions to provide specialize course for talent and skill development Ministry of Economics shall allocate skill development budget to support such initiatives Companies can invest in training their workers with the necessary skills Educational Institutions can play the role of trainer to provide necessary training to companies Developing Al Research Culture: for sustainable benefits and human capital development, Cambodia should also encourage Al research and innovation activities. This may include: Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport shall provide incentives and fund for Al research and innovation This incentive and fund shall be classified into 3 categories: Research fundamental: to support initiatives of researchers and academia Innovation   research: to support   applied research that are potential  for commercialization. This research shall be the cooperation between educational institutions and industries Flagship project: to support long-term and impactful research projects. This kind of project shall consist of educational institutions, industrial and international organizations: 6.5. Develop AI Ecosystem To achieve sustainable and inclusive growth, Cambodia's development strategy should prioritize investing more in Al research; innovation, and entrepreneurship. This can be accomplished by: Creating an Al ecosystem that fosters collaboration beyond just cooperation among stakeholders: Use the quadruple helix paradigm to involves academics, government, industrial and societies to ensure social equality , minimize perpetuate biases and pose privacy risks Develop a national strategy to encourage business collaboration: This may include: The Ministry of Economic shall consider funding budgets to support public-private partnerships research & innovation; knowledge transfer and commercialization on applied-Al projects. Governments should also consider policies such as tax reductions or incentives for industries investing in Al research and innovation: Such policies will encourage industry to invest in research and development; build innovative applications, and generate job opportunities 54

Page 70:

Encourage collaboration between industry and educational institutions. Academia can contribute research expertise, train talent, and facilitate knowledge transfer to industry 6.6. Foster International Collaborations Global collaboration and swift policy actions are essential in the market-driven field of Al. For Cambodia to remain competitive on the stage, it is crucial to cultivate world-class talent through various strategies: The first step is to identify skill gaps in education, research, and innovation. Then, offer attractive scholarships and incentives for Cambodian individuals to study abroad and fill these gaps. The scholarship source can be funding by Government through budget planning organized by Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport Industry funding International cooperation and co-funding Secondly; Cambodia needs to establish its own research platform to  facilitate knowledge sharing and promote research activities amongst Cambodian researchers, ultimately improving the quality of research in the country and creating opportunities for international partnerships: Lastly, implementing a special   grant package that encourages regional and international collaboration will help to advance Al research and innovation in Cambodia and elevate Cambodia's research quality to an international level. 55 global

MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK 7 FOREWORD In 2019, the world saw significant advances in the sophistication and pervasive use of artificial intelligence (""Al""). For instance, we witnessed the emergence of next-generation Al-powered natural text generators like GPT-2, which can generate passages that are difficult to distinguish from human writing: We also saw the development of Dactyl, a robotic hand, which uses reinforcement learning to grasp and manipulate common household objects with human-like dexterity: These examples attest to the of Al's advancement and how it will become ubiquitous in our daily lives. The discourse on Al ethics and governance has also moved forward. Over the last two years, governments and international organisations have begun issuing principles, frameworks and recommendations on Al ethics and governance. In January 2019, Singapore launched our Model Al Governance Framework (""Model Framework"") at the World Economic Forum in Davos: The Model Frameworks unique contribution to the global discourse on Al ethics lies in translating ethical principles into practical recommendations that organisations could readily adopt to deploy Al responsibly We are heartened by the diversity of organisations that have adopted the  practices outlined in the Model Framework, which underscores its ease-of-use and relevance. Singapore is to launch the second edition of the Model Framework. This edition incorporates the experiences of organisations thathave adopted Al, and feedback from our participation in leading international platforms, such as the European Commission's High-Level Expert Group and the OECD Expert Group on Al. Such input has enabled us to provide clearer and effective guidance for organisations to implement Al responsibly: speed proud

8 Singapore's Info-communications Media Development Authority (""IMDA"") and Personal Data Protection Commission (""PDPC"") have also partnered the World Economic Forum Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution to develop an Implementation and Self-Assessment Guide for Organisations (""ISAGO""). The ISAGO complements the Model Framework by allowing organisations to assess the alignment of their Al governance practices with the Model Framework, while providing useful industry examples and practices. We are also publishing a Compendium of Use Cases, which features real- world examples of how organisations have implemented or aligned their Al governance practices with the Model Framework. Together; these initiatives enable any organisation to establish and refine its Al governance practices in concrete and practical ways. These initiatives play a critical role in Singapores National Al Strategy: epitomise our plans to develop a human-centric approach towards Al governance that builds and sustains trust. also reflect our emphasis on co-creating an Al ecosystem in a collaborative and inclusive manner: The Model Framework and ISAGO will pave the way for future developments, such as the training of professionals on ethical Al deployment; and laying the groundwork for Singapore, and the world, to better address Als impact on society: The steps we take today will leave an indelible imprint on our collective future. The Model Framework has been recognised as a firm foundation for the responsible use of Al and its future evolution. We will build on this momentum to advance a human-centric approach to Al one that facilitates innovation and safeguards trust to ensure Al's positive impact on the world for generations to come.

10 1.1 The Model Framework focuses primarily on four broad areas: internal governance structures and measures, human involvement in Al-augmented decision-making, operations management and stakeholder interaction and communication. While the Model Framework is certainly not limited in ambition, it is ultimately limited by form, purpose and practical considerations of scope. With that in mind, several caveats bear mentioning: The Model Framework is a  Algorithm-agnostic It does not focus on Al or data analytics methodology: It applies to the design, application and use of Al in general. b. Technology-agnostic It does not focus on systems, software or technology and will apply regardless of development language and data storage method: Sector-agnostic It serves as a baseline set of considerations and measures for organisations operating in any sector to adopt: Specific sectors or organisations may choose to include additional considerations and measures or adapt this baseline set to meet their needs. The PDPC encourages and will collaborate with agencies adapting the Model Framework for their sectors. d. Scale- and Business-model-agnostic It does not focus on organisations of a particular scale or size. It can also be used by organisations engaging in business-to-business or business-to-consumer activities and operations, or in any other business model. specific specific public

MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK 11 1.2 It is recognised that there are a number of issues that are closely interrelated to the ethical use and deployment of Al. This Model Framework does not focus on these specific issues, which are often sufficient in scope to warrant separate study and treatment: Examples of these issues include: a Articulating a new set of ethical principles for AI. There are already a number of  attempts   globally in establishing a universal set of principles. While a consistent core set of ethical principles is emerging, there is also a penumbra of variation across cultures, jurisdictions and industry sectors. The Model Framework uses existing and common Al ethical principles (a compilation of which is set out in Annex A) and converts them into implementable practices. b. Providing model frameworks and addressing issues around data sharing, whether between the and private sectors or between  organisations or within consortia. There are a number of guides that are relevant, such as the IMDA's Trusted Data Sharing Framework and the Guide to Data Valuation for Data Sharing: Discussing issues   relating to the legal liabilities associated with Al, intellectual property rights, and societal impacts of Al on employment; competition, unequal access to Al products and services by different segments of society, Al technologies falling into hands of wrong people) , etc: These issues are nevertheless pertinent and can be separately through platforms such as the Centre for Al and Data Governance established in the Singapore Management University School of Law: public (e.g: explored

MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK 13 OBJECTIVES 2.1 The exponential growth in data and computing power has fuelled the advancement of data-driven technologies such as AI. Al can be used by organisations to provide new and services, boost productivity, enhance competitiveness, ultimately leading to economic growth and a better quality of life. As with any new technology, however; Al also introduces new ethical, legal and governance   challenges: These include risks of unintended discrimination potentially leading to unfair outcomes, as well as issues relating to consumers' knowledge abouthow Al is involved in making significant or sensitive decisions about them: 2.2 The PDPC,' with advice from the Advisory Council, proposes this second edition of the and voluntary Model Framework as a general, ready-to-use tool to enable organisations that are deploying Al solutions at scale to do so in a responsible manner This Model Framework is not intended for organisations that are deploying updated commercial off-the-shelf software packages that happen to now incorporate Al in their feature set: 2.3 This voluntary Model Framework provides guidance on the issues to be considered and measures that can be implemented. Adopting this Model Framework will require tailoring the measures to address the risks identified for the implementing organisation. The Model Framework is intended to assist organisations to achieve the following objectives: a_ Build stakeholder confidence in Al through organisations'  responsible use of Al to manage different risks in Al deployment b_ Demonstrate   reasonable efforts to align internal policies, structures and processes with relevant accountability-based practices in data management and protection (e.g: the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (""PDPA"") and the OECD Privacy Principles). Under section 5 of Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act 2012,the IMDA is designated as the PDPC: goods living key

Page 14:

14 2.4 To assist organisations in implementing the Model Framework, the PDPC has also prepared a complementary ISAGO. The ISAGO helps organisations assess the alignment of their Al governance practices and processes with the Model Framework: It also provides additional useful industry references and examples that further clarify the recommendations set out in this Model Framework 2.5 The extent to which organisations adopt the recommendations in this Model Framework depends on several factors, including the nature and complexity of the Al used by organisations, the extent to which Al is employed in the organisations' decision- making, and the severity and probability of the impact of the autonomous decision on individuals. 2.6 To elaborate: Al technologies may be used to augment a human decision-maker or to autonomously make a decision For instance, the impact of an autonomous decision in medical diagnosis is arguably greater than that in a product recommendation: The commercial risks of Al deployment is therefore proportionate to the impact on individuals. Generally, where the cost of implementing Al technologies in an ethical manner outweighs the expected benefits, organisations should consider whether alternative non-Alsolutions should be adopted: The considerations and recommendations set out in this Framework are intended to guide   organisations that have decided to deploy AI technologies at scale.

Page 15:

MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK 15 GUIDING PRINCIPLES 2.7 The Model Framework is based on two high-level  guiding principles that promote trust in Al and understanding ofthe use of Al technologies: a Organisations Al in decision-making should ensure thatthe decision-making process is explainable , transparent and fair. Although perfect  explainability,  transparency and fairness are impossible to attain, organisations should strive to ensure that their use or application of Al is undertaken in a manner that reflects the objectives of these principles as far as possible. This helps build trust and confidence in AI: b. Al solutions should be human-centric. As Al is used to amplify human capabilities, the protection ofthe interests of human beings, including their well-being and should be the primary considerations in the  design, development and deployment of AI: Organisations should ensure that Al decision-making processes are explainable, transparent and fair while Al solutions should be human-centric: using safety,

Page 16:

16 2.8 Like other technologies, Al aims to increase human productivity: However; unlike earlier technologies, some aspects of autonomous predictions or decisions made by Al may not be fully explainable: As Al technologies can make decisions that affect individuals, or have a significant impact on society, markets or economies, organisations should consider this Model Framework to their deployment of AI. 2.9 Organisations should detail a set of ethical principles when embark on deployment of Al at scale within their processes or to empower their products and/or services. Where necessary, organisations may wish to refer to the compilation of Al ethical principles in Annex A: As far as possible, organisations should also review their existing corporate values and incorporate the ethical principles that have articulated: Some of the ethical principles (e.g: safety) may be articulated as risks that can be incorporated into the corporate risk management framework The Model Framework is designed to assist organisations incorporating ethical principles into familiar and pre-existing corporate governance structures, and thereby aid in guiding the adoption of Al in an organisation: using guide they they by

MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK 17 ASSUMPTIONS 2.10 The Model Framework aims to discuss good data management practices in general. The Model Framework is mainly applicable to machine learning models (as compared to pure decision tree-driven Al models). 2.11 The Model Framework does not address the risk of catastrophic failure due to cyber-attacks on an organisation heavily dependent on Al. Organisations remain responsible for ensuring the availability, reliability, quality and safety of their products and services, regardless of whether Al technologies are used: 2.12 Adopting this voluntary Model Framework will not absolve organisations from compliance with current laws and regulations: However; as this is an accountability-based framework, adopting it will assist  organisations in demonstrating that had implemented accountability-based practices in data management and protection, eg- the PDPA and OECD Privacy Principles 2.13 Further; it should be noted that certain industry sectors (such as in the finance, healthcare, and legal sectors) may be regulated by existing  sector-specific laws,  regulations or guidelines relevant to the sector: For example, the Monetary Authority of Singapore published the Principles to Promote Fairness, Ethics, Accountability and Transparency in the Use of Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics in Singapore's Financial Sector (the FEAT Principles"") to provide guidance to firms that use Al and data analytics to offer financial products and services.? Organisations are advised to remain mindful of such laws, regulations and guidelines, as adopting the Model Framework does not mean that organisations are in compliance with such sector-specific laws, regulations or guidelines Monetary Authority of Singapore, ""Principles to Promote Fairness, Ethics, Accountability and Transparency (FEAT) in the Use of Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics in Singapore's Financial Sector' (12 November 2018) <https:/ /www.mas _ gov.sg/publications/monographs or-information-paper/2018/FEAT > . they

The definitions of some terms used in this Model Framework are as follows: refers to a set of technologies that seek to simulate human ""Al"" traits such as knowledge, reasoning, problem solving, perception; learning and planning, and, depending on the Al model, produce an output or decision (such as a prediction, recommendation, and/or classification): Al technologies rely on Al algorithms to generate models.

""Organisations refers to companies or other entities that adopt or deploy Al solutions in their  operations, such as backroom operations processing applications for loans) , front-of-house services (e.g: e-commerce portal or ride-hailing app) , or the sale or distribution of devices that provide Al-powered features (e.g: smart home appliances). ""Individuals"" can, depending on the context, refer to persons to whom organisations intend to supply Al products and/or services, or persons who have already purchased the Al products and/or services These may be referred to as consumers or customers' as well: This definition of Al was adapted from various sources, and contextualised accordingly for the purposes of this Model Framework.

Stakeholder interaction and communication Strategies for  communicating with an organisation's stakeholders , and the management of relationships with them: 3.2 Organisations adopting this Model Framework may find that not all elements are relevant: This Model Framework is meant to be flexible, and organisations can adapt the Model Framework to suit their needs and adopting those elements that are relevant: 3.3 To help organisations better understand the Model Framework, we have included (in each section) illustrations demonstrating how real-world companies have implemented certain practices described in that section. In addition, the PDPC has also released a Compendium of Use Cases that illustrates how various local and international organisations have put in place Al governance practices that are aligned to all sections of the Model Framework. key specific

MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK 21 INTERNAL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES AND MEASURES 3.4 This section is intended to organisations in developing appropriate internal governance structures that allow organisations to have appropriate oversight over how AI technologies are brought into their operations and/or products and services. 3.5 Internal governance structures and measures help to ensure robust oversight over an organisation's use of AI. The organisation's existing internal governance structures can be adapted, andlor new structures can be implemented if necessary: For example, risks associated with the use of Al can be managed within the enterprise risk management structure, while ethical considerations can be introduced as corporate values and managed through ethics review boards or similar structures: Ethical considerations can be introduced as corporate values and managed through ethics review boards or similar structures. 3.6 Organisations may also consider determining the appropriate features in their internal governance structures. For example, when relying completely on a centralised governance mechanism is not optimal, a de-centralised one could be considered to incorporate ethical considerations into day-to-day decision- making at the operational level, if necessary: The sponsorship, support and participation of the organisation's top management and its board of directors in the organisation's Al governance are crucial: guide

Page 22:

22 3.7 Organisations may wish to consider including features that are relevant to the development of their internal governance structure, such as: 1 Clear roles and responsibilities for the ethical deployment of AI a Responsibility for and oversight of the various stages and activities involved in Al deployment should be allocated to the appropriate  personnel and/or departments. If necessary and possible, consider establishing a coordinating body, having relevant expertise and proper representation from across the organisation: b Personnel andlor departments having internal Al governance functions should be fully aware of their roles and responsibilities, be properly trained, and be provided with the resources and guidance needed for them to discharge their duties. C roles and responsibilities that can be allocated include: L. Using any existing risk management framework and applying risk control measures (see Risk management and internal controls' below) to: Assess and manage the risks of deploying Al, including any potential adverse impact on the individuals who are most vulnerable, how are impacted, how to assess the scale of the impact, how to get feedback from those impacted, etc ) Decide on the appropriate level of human involvement in Al-augmented decision-making: Manage the Al model training and selection process: Key (e.g: they

Where applicable and necessary, staff who are working and interacting directly with Al models may need to be trained to interpret Al model output and decisions and to detect and manage bias in data: Other staff whose work deals with the Al system (e.g: a customer relationship officer answering customer queries about the Al system, or a salesperson   using an Al-enabled product to make a recommendation) should be trained to be at least aware of and sensitive to the benefits, risks and limitations when using Al, so that they know when to alert subject-matter experts within their organisations

Risk management and internal controls a Organisations can consider implementing a sound system of risk management and internal controls that specifically addresses the risks involved in the deployment of the selected Al model. b Such measures include: Using reasonable efforts to ensure that the datasets used for Al model training are adequate for the intended purpose, and to assess and manage the risks of inaccuracy or bias, as well as reviewing exceptions identified during model training: Virtually, no dataset is   completely unbiased. Organisations should strive to understand the ways in which datasets may be biased and address this in their safety measures and deployment strategies ii. Establishing monitoring and reporting systems as well as processes to ensure that the appropriate level of management is aware of the performance of and other issues relating to the deployed AI. Where appropriate, the monitoring can include autonomous monitoring to effectively scale human oversight: Al systems can be designed to report on the confidence level of their predictions, and explainability features could focus on why the Al model had a certain level of confidence. Mii. Ensuring proper knowledge transfer whenever there are changes in personnel involved in AI activities. This will reduce the risk of staff movement creating a gap in internal governance. iv. Reviewing the internal governance structure and measures when there are significant changes to organisational structure or personnel involved.

Its multi-stakeholder governance structures facilitate decisions at appropriate levels: Research Board consisting of the Chief Technology Officer; the Head of Labs and the Chief Data Scientist, approves the Al development and deployment: In particular; the Chief Technology Officer oversees four technical teams which consists of more than 100 employees. Their roles and responsibilities are clearly defined: a Research team performs data analysis, research and develop Machine Learning (""ML"") models and Al algorithms; b: Engineering team builds software, cloud services and applications; Operation team deploys the Al model and upgrade platform; and d. Delivery team engages with operators and integrate services.

To base decisions on honesty, fairness, respect, responsibility, integrity, trust, and sound business judgment; C That no illegal or unethical conduct on the part of officers, directors, employees, or affiliates is in the companys best interest; and d. Not to compromise the company's principles for short-term advantage: MASTERCARD: ILLUSTRATION ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES AND MEASURES Mastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry: Its global payments processing network connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments and businesses in more than 210 countries and territories. To achieve its vision, Mastercard leveraged Al in many applications such as fraud prevention, forecasting future spending trends and improving user retail experience. To ensure robust oversight of Mastercard's use of Al, Mastercard established a Governance Council to review and approve the implementation of Al applications that are determined to be high risk: The Governance Council is chaired by its Executive Vice President of the Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence, and whose members include the Chief Data Officer; Chief Privacy Officer; Chief Information Security Officer; data scientists and representatives from business teams. Mastercard has defined clear roles and responsibilities for the Governance Council: Each representative on the Council brings their expertise to the decision- making process:

In addition, Mastercard will identify potential mitigants as part of the process to reduce the level of risk posed by the data being collected or potential biases in the activity: If an Al project has been identified as high risk, it will be referred to the Governance Council for review: Low risk projects will not be subjected to a review and can proceed to the model development stage.

28 DETERMINING THE LEVEL OF HUMAN INVOLVEMENT IN AI- AUGMENTED DECISION-MAKING 3.8 This section is intended to help organisations determine the appropriate extent of human   oversight in Al-augmented decision-making: 3.9 Having clarity on the objective of using Al is a first step in determining the extent of human oversight: Organisations can start by deciding on their commercial objectives of using Al ensuring consistency in decision-making, improving operational efficiency and reducing costs, or introducing new product features to increase consumer choice): These commercial objectives can then be weighed against the risks of using Al in the organisation's decision-making: This assessment should be guided by organisations' corporate values, which in turn, could reflect the societal norms or expectations of the territories in which the organisations operate. Before deploying Al solutions, organisations should decide on their commercial objectives of using Al, and then weigh them against the risks of using Al in the organisation's decision-making: 3.10 It is also desirable for organisations operating in multiple countries to consider the differences in societal norms, values and/or expectations, where possible. Forexample, gaming advertisements may be acceptable in one country but not in another: Even within a country, risks may vary significantly depending on where Al is deployed: For example, risks to individuals associated with recommendation engines that promote products in an online mall or automating the approval of online applications for travel insurance may be lower than the risks associated with algorithmic trading facilities offered to sophisticated investors. key (e.g:

Page 29:

MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK 29 3.11 Some risks to individuals may only manifest at group level: For example, widespread adoption of a stock recommendation algorithm might cause herding behaviour; increasing overall market volatility if sufficiently large numbers of individuals make similar decisions atthe same time. In addition to risks to individuals, other types of risks may also be identified risk to an organisation's commercial reputation): 3.12 Organisations' weighing of their commercial objectives against the risks of using Al should ideally be guided by their corporate values. Organisations can assess if the intended Al deployment and the selected model for algorithmic decision-making are consistent with their own core values: inconsistencies and deviations should be conscious decisions made by organisations with a clearly defined and documented rationale. 3.13 As identifying commercial objectives, risks and determining the appropriate level of human involvement in Al-augmented decision-making is an iterative and ongoing process, it is desirable for organisations to continually identify and review risks relevant to their technology solutions, mitigate those risks, and maintain a response plan should mitigation fail. Documenting this   process   through a periodically reviewed risk impact assessment helps organisations develop clarity and confidence in using the Al solutions: It will also help organisations respond to potential challenges from individuals, other organisations or businesses, and regulators (e.g. Any

30 WHAT ARE THE THREE BROAD APPROACHES OF HUMAN INVOLVEMENT IN AI-AUGMENTED DECISION-MAKING? 3.14 Based on the risk management approach described above, the Model Framework identifies three broad approaches to classify the various degrees of human oversight in the decision-making process: a Human-in-the-loop suggests that human oversight is active and involved, with the human retaining full controlandthe Al only providing recommendations or input: Decisions cannot be exercised without affirmative actions by the human, such as a human command to proceed with a given decision. For example, a doctor may use Al to identify possible diagnoses of and treatments for an unfamiliar medical condition. However; the doctor will make the final decision on the diagnosis and the corresponding treatment: This model requires Al to provide enough information for the human to make an informed decision (e.g. factors that are used in the decision, their value and weighting, correlations): b Human-out-of-the-loop suggests that there is no human oversight over the execution of decisions The Al system has full control without the option of human override. For example, a product recommendation solution may automatically suggest products and services to individuals based on pre-determined demographic and behavioural profiles Al can also dynamically create new profiles, then make product and service suggestions rather than relying on predetermined categories. machine learning model might also be used by an airline to forecast demand or likely disruptions, and the outputs of this model are used by a solver module to optimise the airline's scheduling, without a human in the C Human-over-the-loop (orhuman-on-the-loop) suggests that human oversight is involved to the extent that the human is in a monitoring or supervisory role, with the ability to take over control when the Al model encounters unexpected or undesirable events (such as model failure). This approach allows humans to adjust parameters during the operation of the algorithm. For example, a GPS navigation system plans the route from Point A to Point B, offering several possible routes for the driver to pick The driver can alter parameters (e.g: due to unforeseen road congestions) during the trip without having to re-programme the route. loop.

Page 31:

MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK 31 3.15 The Model Framework also proposes a design framework (structured as a matrix) to help organisations determine the level ofhuman involvement required in Al-augmented decision-making: This design framework is structured two axes: the (a) probability; and (b) severity ofharm to an individual (or organisation) as a result of the decision made by an organisation about that individual (or organisation): 3.16 The definition of harm and the computation of probability and severity will depend on the context and vary from sector to sector: For example, the considerations of a hospital regarding the harm associated with a wrong diagnosis of a patients medical condition will differ from the considerations of a clothing store's regarding the harm associated with a wrong product recommendation for apparels. Hieh severity High severity L Low probability High probability "" 1 Low severity Low severity Low probability High probability Probability of Harm 3.17 The matrix, however; should not be taken to imply that the probability of harm and severity of harm are the only factors to be considered in determining the level ofhuman oversight in an organisation's decision-making process involving Al (although are generally two of the more important factors) c 3.18 For safety-critical systems, it would be prudent for organisations to ensure that a person be allowed to assume control, with the Al system providing sufficient information for that person to make meaningful decisions or to safely shut down the system where human control is not possible. Other factors that organisations in various contexts may consider relevant; could also include: (a) the nature of harm (i.e: whether the harm is physical or intangible in nature); (b) the reversibility of harm, and as a corollary to this, the ability for individuals to obtain recourse; and (c) whether it is operationally feasible or meaningful for a human to be involved in decision-making process having human-in-the-loop would be unfeasible in high- financial trading, and be impractical in the case of driverless vehicles) along they (e.g. speed

The RECOMMENDED! automation will meet the organisation's commercial objective of operational efficiency: Probability-severity assessment The definition of harm can be the impact of making product recommendations that do not address the perceived needs of the individuals. The severity of harm in making the wrong product recommendations to individuals may be low since individuals ultimately decide whether to make the purchase: The probability of harm may be high or low depending on the efficiency and efficacy of the Al solution.

Organisations can consider testing this method of determining the Al decision-making model against cases with more challenging and complex ethical dilemmas. points

Suade's solution also allows users to analyse the impact of the existing stock of regulation, including the impact of individual pieces of legislation. In determining the level of human involvement in decision-making using Al, Suade considered the following key factors: a Degree of domain knowledge legal or policy-making knowledge) required to accurately interpret the results of the algorithm. b_ Cost of non-compliance to regulation if the Al tool does not accurately analyse the impact of regulation and provide correct suggestions for regulatory compliance. As Suade's solution requires a certain degree of domain knowledge from human experts, and given that the cost of regulatory non-compliance as a result of incorrect recommendations made by the Al solution will be significant to users, Suade has thus adopted a human-in-the-loop approach for its Al solution: On the other hand, when it comes to tuning the Al model, Suade adopts a human-over-the-loop approach: In general, Suade tunes the Al model to automatically favour the identification of false positives over false negatives. However; Suade conducted user research, which informed them that some users the model to favour false negatives over false positives. Therefore, Suade adopts a human-over-the-loop approach so that the Al model can be tuned to account for the differing preferences of its users with respect to whether the algorithm produces results that favours false positives or false negatives: (e.g: prefer

It uses Al across its platform, from ride allocation, detecting safety incidents, to identifying fraudulent transactions. In particular; Grab uses Al to improve the overall quality of trip allocations and minimise trip cancellations: To allocate trips successfully, Grab's Al model considers drivers' preferences based on the following key factors: a_ Drivers preferences for certain trip types; b. Preferred locations where a driver start and end their and C Other selective driving behaviours. In determining the level of human involvement in its Al's decision-making for trip allocation, Grab considered the following factors: a The scale of real-time decision-making required. As Grab has to make over 5,000 trip allocations every minute, this would mean an impact to customers in terms of 'efficiency and cost if a human had to review each trip allocation; and b_ The severity and probability to users should the Al model work in a sub- optimal manner: Among other factors, Grab considered that: (1) it is not technically feasible for a human to make high volume of trip allocations in a short amount oftime; and (2) there is often little or no harm to life should there be less than optimal trip allocations. Hence , Grab decided to adopt a human-out-of-the-loop approach for its Al model deployed for trip allocation, while continuously reviewing the Al model to ensure optimal performance: day; key such

36 3.21 During   deployment; algorithms such as linear   regression algorithms, decision trees, or neural networks are for analysis on training datasets. The resulting algorithmic models are examined and algorithms are iterated until a model that produces the most appropriate results for the use case emerges This model and its results are then incorporated into applications to offer predictions, make decisions, solve problems and trigger actions. The intimate interaction between data and algorithm/ model is the focus of this part of the Model Framework DATA FOR MODEL DEVELOPMENT 3.22 Datasets used for building models may come from multiple sources, and could include both personal and non-personal data. The quality and selection of data from each of these sources are critical to the success of an Al solution: If a model is built using biased, inaccurate or non-representative  data, the risks of unintended discriminatory decisions from the model will increase. To ensure the effectiveness of an Al solution, relevant departments within the organisation with responsibilities over quality of data, model training and model selection must work together to put in place data accountability practices. 3.23 The persons who are involved in training and selecting models for deployment may be internal staff or external service providers It is ideal for the models deployed in an intelligent to have an internal departmental owner; who will be the one making decisions on which models to deploy: To ensure the effectiveness of an Al solution, it would be helpful for relevant departments within the organisation with responsibilities over quality of data, model training and model selection to work together to put in place good data accountability practices. These include the following: applied good system

Page 37:

MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK 37 a  Understanding the lineage of data: This means knowing where the data originally came from, how it was collected, curated and moved within the organisation, and how its accuracy is maintained over time. Data lineage can be represented visually to trace how the data moves from its source to its destination, how the data transformed along the way; where itinteracts with other data, and how the representations change: There are three types of data lineage: Backward data lineage looks at the data from its end-use and backdating it to its source. ii. Forward data lineage begins at the data's source and follows it through to its end-use. iii. End-to-end data lineage combines the two and looks at the entire solution from both the data's source to its end-use and from its end-use to its source. Keeping a data provenance record allows an organisation to ascertain the quality of the data based on its origin and subsequent transformation, trace potential sources of errors, data, and attribute data to their sources: In some instances, the origin of  data could be difficult to establish. One example could be datasets obtained from a trusted third-party which may have commingled data from multiple sources: It would be prudent for organisations to assess the risks of using such data and manage them accordingly: gets update

Page 38:

38 b Ensuring data quality: Organisations are encouraged to understand and address factors that may affect the quality of data, such as: The accuracy of the dataset, in terms of how well the values in the dataset match the true characteristics of the entities described by the dataset; ii. The completeness of the dataset, both in terms of attributes and items; iii. The veracity of the dataset, which refers to how credible the data is, including whether the data originated from a reliable source; iv. How recently the dataset was compiled or updated; The relevance of the dataset and the context for data collection, as it may affect the interpretation of and reliance on the data for the intended purpose; vi. The integrity of the dataset that has been joined from multiple datasets, which refers to how well extraction and transformation have been performed; vii. The usability of the dataset; including how well the dataset is structured in a machine- understandable and viii. Human interventions ifany human has filtered, labels, or edited the data): Minimising inherent bias: There are many types of bias relevant to AI: The Model Framework focuses on inherent bias in datasets, which may lead to undesired outcomes such as unintended discriminatory decisions. Organisations should be aware that the data which provide to Al systems could contain inherent biases and are encouraged to take steps to mitigate such bias. The two common types of bias in data include: form; (e.g: applied they

Page 39:

MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK 39 Selection bias: This bias occurs when the data used to produce the model are not fully representative of the actual data or environment thatthe model may receive or function in. Common examples of selection bias in datasets are omission bias and stereotype bias. Omission bias describes the omission of certain characteristics from the dataset: For example, a dataset consisting only of Asian faces will exhibit omission bias ifit is used for facial recognition training for a population that includes non-Asians: A dataset of vehicle types within the central business district on a weekday may exhibit stereotype bias weighted in favour of cars, buses and motorcycles but under-represent bicycles if it is used to model the  types of transportation available in Singapore: Ti. Measurement bias: This bias occurs when the data collection device causes the data to be systematically skewed in a particular direction. For example, the training data could be obtained using camera with a colour filter that has been turned off, thereby skewing the machine learning result: While identifying and addressing inherent bias in datasets may not be easy, organisations can mitigate the risk of inherent bias by having a heterogeneous dataset (i.e. collecting data from a variety of reliable sources): Another way is to ensure the dataset is as complete as possible, both from the perspective of data attributes and data items Premature removal of data attributes can make it difficult to identify and address inherent bias.

Page 40:

40 d. Different datasets for training; testing; and validation: Different datasets are required for training, testing, and validation. The model is trained using the training data , while the model's accuracy is determined using the test data. Where applicable, the model could also be checked for systematic bias by testing it on different demographic groups to observe whether any groups are being systematically advantaged or disadvantaged: Finally, the trained model can be validated using the validation dataset: It is considered good practice to split a large dataset into subsets for these purposes, if it does not lead to a significant reduction in the quality of data in terms of accuracy and representation. However; where this is not possible (e.g: if the organisation is not working with large datasets or are using pre-trained models as in the case of transfer learning), organisations are encouraged to be cognisant of the risks of systematic bias and in  place appropriate safeguards. Periodic reviewing and updating of datasets: It would be prudent for datasets (including training, testing, and validation datasets) to be reviewed periodically to ensure accuracy,  quality,  currency, relevance and reliability: Where necessary, the datasets can be updated with new input data obtained from actual use of the Al models deployed in production. When such new input data is used, organisations need to be aware of potential bias as using new input data that has already gone through a model once could create a reinforcement bias. 3.24 Even if only non-personal data are used for the training of Al models (including personal data that has been anonymised) , the data accountability practices above remain relevant: put good

MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK 41 SUADE LABS: ILLUSTRATION ON MANAGING DATA FOR MODEL DEVELOPMENT Suade (introduced above) has developed an Al-enabled solution that financial institutions generate the required data and reports to comply with regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions where operate: As the data used for Suade's Al model development directly affects its quality and performance, Suade has adopted several good data accountability practices: For example, to ensure that regulatory data comes from a credible and reliable source  Suade obtains and updates regulatory data only from the relevant regulators In addition, Suade tags the datasets used with additional metadata. This allows Suade to trace datasets back to their original source when needed, such as where inconsistencies are found. Further; in order to trace which particular datasets were used in an Al model, Suade also documents and stores such information pertaining to model development on its database. Suade also minimises the inherent risks of Al models through responsible data tagging: By using a larger number of taggers (i.e. people who tag data), Suade aims to make the output of its Al models as neutral as possible, and reduce the risk of its taggers being influenced by the context ofthe data (which often comprise of text) are annotating: In other words, Suade uses as many individuals as practicable to tag data to reduce the risk of tagger bias. In addition, Suade developed a tagging system to facilitate the annotation of data: This system is used to generate training data used by the algorithm. Suade will further develop this tagging system to enhance its ability to manage multiple annotators and to better select datasets used for model training: Suade also periodically updates the tagging system with new data. New training data is subsequently fed repeatedly back into the Al model. This way, the Al model is able to continuously learn from new sets of data. Another data accountability practice that Suade adopts is the use of validation schema checks at various stages of data transformation: This is a process in which Suade verifies that the data schema accurately represents the data from the source, to ensure that there are no errors in factors such as the data's formatting and content: helps they they

To deal with socially sensitive features and mitigate the risk of inherent or unintentional bias in the datasets used by the Al model, pymetrics: Uses objective data based on established neuroscience research attention to detail, attention span and ability to recall) , which are generally stable across gender; racial and age groups. Proactively de-biases all Al models to ensure that are fully representative of the environment that may function in, so that the Al models do not disadvantage   people on the basis of their   demographic features: The standards for fairness are informed by legal requirements As a pre- hire assessment; pymetrics models must pass a test known as the four- fifths rule""_ which is commonly cited in employment law. According to US' Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (""EEOC"") , the selection rate for any legally protected group must be at least 80% of the selection rate for the majority group. For example, if an employer screens 200 qualified applicants (100 men and 100 women), a model that selects 50 men must also select at least 40 women: pymetrics will test the Al model against a dataset of users from diverse demographics to ensure that random patterns in the data are not learned by the model and to address any potential for bias. profile (e.g: they they

MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK 43 pymetrics would conduct further de-biasing on additional demographic based on geographical relevance or legal requirements: pymetrics uses a bias ratio to compare the proportional pass rates of the highest-passing demographic group with the lowest-passing group for each demographic category (e.g: gender and ethnicity). The Al model would be deployed only if meet the EEOC standards. After Al deployment; pymetrics: Will test the Al model's decisions on real applicants for adverse impact; and Revisits the long-term impact of its system's predictions on retention for the role. If bias is found either before or after deployment, pymetrics will adjust the Al modelto optimise for fairness towards while ensuring the predictive performance of the Al model: ALGORITHM AND MODEL 3.25 Al systems may have numerous features or functionalities enabled through algorithms in Al models. Measures such as explainability, repeatability, robustness, regular reproducibility, traceability, and auditability can enhance the transparency of algorithms found in Al models. It may not be feasible or cost- effective to implement even the most essential ofthese measures for all algorithms: Organisations are encouraged to take a risk-based approach in making a two-fold assessment: First, identify the subset of features or functionalities that have the greatest impact on stakeholders for which such measures are relevant. Second, identify which of these measures will be most effective in building trust with their  stakeholders: Some of these measures like explainability (or repeatability, when using models that are not easily explained) , robustness and regular tuning are sufficiently essential that could, to varying extents, be incorporated as part of the organisation's Al deployment process. Other measures, such as reproducibility, traceability and auditability are more resource-intensive and may be relevant for features or in specific scenarios. they applicants tuning, they specific

Page 44:

44 Explainability 3.26 Explainability is achieved by explaining how deployed Al models' algorithms function and/or how the decision-making process incorporates model predictions: The purpose of being able to explain predictions made by Al is to build understanding and trust: An algorithm deployed in an Al solution is said to be explainable if how it functions and how it arrives at a particular prediction can be explained: When an algorithm cannot be explained, understanding and trust can still be built by explaining how predictions play a role in the decision-making process: 3.27 Organisations deploying Al solutions are recommended to adopt the following practices: a_ Model training and selection are necessary for developing an intelligent system (i.e. a system that contains Al technologies). Documenting how the model training and selection processes are conducted, the reasons for which decisions are made, and measures taken to address identified risks will enable the organisation to provide an account of the decisions subsequently: In this regard, the field of Automated Machine Learning aims to automate a significant portion of machine learning workflows, including feature  engineering, feature selection, model selection and hyper-parameter tuning: Organisations using these types of tools can consider the transparency; explainability and traceability of the automated machine learning approach, as well as the models selected. b Incorporating descriptions of the solutions' design and expected behaviour into product or service descriptions and system technical specifications documentation demonstrates   accountability to individuals andlor regulators. This could also include design decisions in relation to why certain features, attributes or models are selected in place of others. These steps can help provide greater clarity on an Al model by giving understandable and digestible insights into how the model operates:

Page 45:

MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK 45 Where an organisation's Al system was obtained or procured from a third-party Al solution provider; the organisation can consider requesting assistance from the Al solution provider as may be better placed to explain how the solution functions. C Supplementary   explanation tools are helpful for explaining Al models;6 especially models that are less interpretable (also known as black box"" systems): These tools help make the underlying rationale of an Al system's output more interpretable and intelligible to those who use the system. It is possible to use a combination of these tools to improve the explainability of an Al model's decision: 3.28 Technical explainability may not always be enlightening, especially to the man on the street: Implicit explanations of how the Al models' algorithms function may be more useful than explicit descriptions of the models' logic For example, providing an individual with counterfactuals (such as you would have been approved if your average debt was 15% lower"") andlor comparisons (such as these are users with similar profiles to yours that received a similar decision"") can be a powerful type of explanation that organisations could consider: 3.29 Nevertheless, there may be scenarios where it might not be practical or reasonable to provide information in relation to an algorithm. For example, disclosing algorithms deployed for anti- money laundering detection, information security, and fraud prevention may allow bad actors to avoid detection; likewise , providing detailed information about proprietary algorithms or the decisions made by the algorithms may expose confidential business information. These tools are known as supplementary' as there is at present no single comprehensive technical solution for making Al models explainable. These tools thus play a supplementary role in providing some level of interpretability on an Al model's operation. Examples of these tools include the use of surrogate models, partial dependence plots, global variable importancelinteraction, sensitivity analysis, counterfactual explanations, or Self-Explaining and Attention-Based Systems_ they

Page 46:

46 Repeatability 3.30 Where explainability cannot practicably be achieved given the state of technology, organisations can consider documenting the repeatability of results produced by the Al model. Repeatability refers to the ability to consistently perform an action or make a decision, given the same scenario. While repeatability (of results) is not equivalent to explainability (of algorithm) , some degree of assurance of consistency in performance could provide Al users with a larger degree of confidence. Helpful practices include: a Conducting repeatability assessments for commercial deployments in live environments to ensure that deployments are repeatable; b Performing counterfactual fairness testing: Counterfactual fairness testing ensures that a model's decisions are the same in both the real world and in a counterfactual world where attributes deemed sensitive (such as race or gender) are altered; C Assessing how exceptions can be identified and handled when decisions are not repeatable, e.g: when randomness has been introduced by design; d. Ensuring   exception   handling is in line with organisations' policies; In this regard, it may be helpful to use Al models that are able to recognise when a given set of facts contains new variables not previously considered and are able to highlight these new variables to a human; e Identifying and accounting for changes over time to ensure that models trained on time-sensitive data remain relevant: James Manyika , Jake Sitberg, and Brittany Presten, ""What Do We Do About the Biases in Al?""

MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK 47 Robustness 3.31 Robustness refers to the ability of a computer system to cope with errors during execution and erroneous input, and is assessed by the degree to which a system or component can function correctly in the presence of invalid input or stressful environmental conditions. Ensuring that deployed models are sufficiently robust will contribute towards building trust in the Al system. 3.32 The concept of robustness arises because it is not possible for models to be able to enumerate and set out all preconditions and consequences for an action. This creates the possibility of models producing insensible or unexpected results even with minor modifications to input data (thatmay not even be perceptible to humans) Testing for robustness can be achieved through scenario-based testing for foreseeable erroneous input 8 To ensure that models are more robust, organisations can consider working with Al developers to conduct adversarial testing on their models to ensure that their models are able to handle a broader range of unexpected input variables (especially for public-facing Al systems). As this is a resource-intensive exercise , organisations can take a risk-based approach towards identifying the subset of Al-powered features in their products or services that requires adversarial testing: 3.33 No model can be perfectly robust as it is not possible to detect all possible modifications to a set of input data. For this reason, organisations intending to use continual learning (i.e: where the learned parameters of a machine learning model are not fixed but the model continues to change its learned parameters after being deployed into production) are encouraged to be aware of the risks of doing so, should the continual learning model behave in an unpredictable manner This is distinct from user acceptance testing (""UAT"") , which is process where actual software users test piece of software to ensure that it can handle required tasks in real- world scenarios, based on specifications UAT is often critical step that is taken before newly-developed software is released to the market:

48 Regular tuning 3.34 Establishing an internal policy and process to perform regular model tuning is effective for ensuring that deployed models cater for changes to customer behaviour over time. This allows organisations to refresh models based on updated training datasets that incorporate new input data. Model tuning may also be necessary when commercial objectives, risks, or corporate values change. 3.35 Wherever possible, testing should reflect the dynamism of the planned production environment: To ensure safety, testing may need to assess the degree to which an Al solution generalises well and fails gracefully: For example, a warehouse robot tasked with avoiding obstacles to complete a task picking up packages) could be tested with different types of obstacles and realistically varied internal environments workers wearing a variety of different coloured shirts). Otherwise, models risk learning regularities in the environment that do not reflect actual production environment conditions assuming that all humans that it must avoid will be wearing white lab coats). Once Al models are deployed in the real-world environment; active monitoring, review and tuning are advised. Traceability 3.36 An Al model is considered to be traceable if (a) its decisions, and (b) the datasets and processes that the Al model's decision (including those of data gathering, data labelling and the algorithms used) , are documented in an easily understandable way: The former refers to traceability of Al-augmented decisions, while the latter refers to traceability in model training: Traceability facilitates transparency and explainability, and is also helpful for other reasons. First, the information might also be useful for troubleshooting, or for an investigation into how the model was functioning or why a particular prediction was made. Second, the traceability record (in the form ofan audit log) can be a source of input data that can be used as a training dataset in the future. (e.g: (e.g. (e.g: yield

Page 49:

MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK 49 3.37 Practices that organisations may consider to promote traceability include: a Building an audit trail to document the model training and Al-augmented decision. b. Implementing a black box recorder that captures all input data streams. For example, a black box recorder in a driving car tracks the vehicle's position and records when and where the self-driving system takes control of the vehicle, suffers a technical problem or requests the driver to take over the control of the vehicle. C= Ensuring that data relevant to traceability are stored appropriately to avoid degradation or alteration, and retained for durations relevant to the industry: 3.38 As traceability measures may lead to an accumulation of a large volume of activity data, organisations can consider which oftheir product features   require   traceability and which  traceability measures might be sufficient for their needs, bearing in mind the resources needed to document the Al model's decisions, datasets and processes. Organisations could assess this based on several factors, including: a Their assessment of the probability andlor severity of harm arising from the use of the Al system; bs The extent to which the Al model had previously been trialled or used; and C The regulatory needs of their industry: It should be noted that black box recorder does not refer to ""black box in the Al model sense (i.e. where the decision-making process of an Al model is inherently difficult to interpret and explain). self_

50 Reproducibility 3.39 While repeatability refers to the internal repetition of results within ones organisation, reproducibility refers to the ability of an independent verification team to produce the same results using the same Al method based on the documentation made by the organisation. Reproducibility can influence the trustworthiness of the Al product and the organisation deploying the Al model. As implementing  reproducibility entails the involvement of external parties, organisations can take a risk-based approach towards identifying the subset of Al-powered features in their products or services that requires external reproducibility testing: 3.40 The following practices contribute towards reproducibility: a_ Testing whether  specific   contexts or particular conditions would need to be taken into account to ensure reproducibility; b. Putting in place verification methods to ensure different aspects of the Al models reliability and reproducibility; C Making available replication files (.e. files that replicate each step of the Al models developmental process) to facilitate the process of testing and reproducing behaviours; d. For companies that procure commercial off-the-shelf Al systems, checking with the original Al solution provider about whether the model's results are reproducible; and Adopting in paragraph 3.30 (c)-(e) under repeatability (namely, assessing how exceptions can be identified and handled, ensuring that exception- handling is in line with organisational policies, and identifying and accounting for changes over time). points

MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK 51 Auditability 3.41 Auditability refers to the readiness of an Al system to undergo an assessment of its algorithms, data and design processes. The evaluation of the Al system by internal or external auditors (and the availability of evaluation reports) can contribute to the trustworthiness of the Al  system as it demonstrates the responsibility of design and practices and the justifiability of outcomes: It should, however; be noted that auditability does not necessarily entail making information about business models or intellectual property related to the Al system publicly available: 3.42 Implementing auditability not only entails the involvement of external parties but requires disclosure of commercially sensitive information to the auditors, who may be external. Organisations can take a risk-based approach towards identifying the subset of Al-powered features in their products or services for which implementing auditability is necessary, or where implementing auditability is necessary for an organisation to align itself with regulatory requirements or industry practice. 3.43 To facilitate auditability, organisations can consider keeping a comprehensive record of data provenance, procurement, pre- processing, lineage, storage and security: The record could also include   qualitative  input about data   representations, data sufficiency, source integrity, data timelines, data relevance, and unforeseen data issues encountered across the workflow: 3.44 Organisations may also wish to centralise such information digitally in a process This would enable the organisation to make available, in one place, information that may assistin demonstrating to concerned parties and affected decision subjects both the responsibility of design and practices and the justifiability of the outcomes of your system's processing behaviour: Such a would also enable better organisation of the accessibility and presentation of information yielded, assist in the curation and protection of data that should be kept unavailable from view, and increase the organisation's capacity to cater the presentation of results to different tiers of stakeholders with different interests and levels of expertise. log: log public

52 SYMPHONY AYASDIAI: ILLUSTRATION ON DOCUMENTING MODEL DEVELOPMENT Symphony AyasdiAI (""Ayasdi"") offers a solution that helps its clients, mainly in the US banking and finance sector; to build Al models that can adequately forecast revenues and the capital reserve required to absorb losses under stressed economic conditions. Its clients need to prove to the US Federal Reserve that their Al models are accurate and defensible. The solution - Ayasdi's Model Accelerator (the AMA"") - first identifies relevant variables to include in the model and then why they are selected: AMA does this by looking at possible relationships encoded within the enriched base-level data, and finding hidden patterns that hold predictive value: The AMA then uses the variables selected to build Al models: It presents a candidate model and several viable challenger models for the clients' selection. Business units within the clients"" organisations will evaluate the candidate and challenger models and select those that best represent their business units. The entire model creation process is documented automatically: The clients can use AMA to institutionalise both their variable selection and modelling methodology, systematically and deterministically; to produce a repeatable process with consistent supporting reports on model lineage, variable selection and cross-validation. This allows the clients to ensure that initial selections of features and models are recorded and documented: At the same time, the entire modelling and approval process is tracked and catalogued, thus facilitating subsequent processes from review to model re-use: The ability to demonstrate the detailed process of model building and the rigour of evaluating challenger models allows Ayasdi's clients to explain to the US Federal Reserve how their final models are selected: explains

MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK 53 STAKEHOLDER INTERACTION AND COMMUNICATION 8 3.45 This section is intended to help organisations take appropriate steps to build trust in the stakeholder relationship strategies when deploying AI. General disclosure 3.46 Organisations are encouraged to provide general information on whether Al is used in their products and/or services. Where appropriate, this could include information on what Al is, how Al is used in decision-making in relation to consumers, what are its benefits, why your organisation has decided to use Al, how your organisation has taken steps to mitigate risks, and the role and extent that Al plays in the decision-making process. For example, an online portal may inform its users that are interacting with an Al-powered chatbot and not a human customer service agent: 3.47 Organisations can consider disclosing the manner in which an Al decision may affect an individual consumer; and whether the decision is reversible. For example, an organisation may inform the individuals that their credit ratings may lead to a loan refusal not only from this organisation but also from other  similar organisations, while also informing them that such a decision is reversible if individuals can provide more evidence on their credit worthiness. Policy for explanation 3.48 Organisations are encouraged to develop a policy on what explanations to provide to individuals and when to provide them. Such policies help ensure consistency in communication, and clearly sets out roles and responsibilities of different members of your organisation. These can include explanations on how AI works in an Al-augmented decision-making process, how a specific decision was made and the reasons behind that decision, and the impact and consequence of the decision. The explanation can be provided as part of general communication: It can also be information in respect of a decision upon request: In this regard, the principle of equivalence can provide some guidance such that the same standards of disclosure forhuman- driven decisions is applied to decisions that have been made or augmented by an Al system. they specific

54 Bringing explainability and transparency together in a meaningful way 3.49 Appropriate interaction and communication inspire trust and confidence as build and maintain open relationships between organisations and individuals (including employees) . Stakeholder relationship strategies should also not remain static. Companies are encouraged to test, evaluate and review their strategies for effectiveness: Further; the extent and mode of implementation of these factors could vary from scenario to scenario. 3.50 As different stakeholders have different information needs, an organisation can start by first identifying its audience (i.e: its external and internal stakeholders). An organisation's external stakeholders may include consumers, regulators, other organisations it does business with, and society at large. Its internal  stakeholders may include the organisation's board, management and employees. An organisation can also consider the purpose and the context of the interaction with its stakeholders. For the purposes of  illustration, this Model Framework provides considerations for interacting with consumers and other organisations: As different stakeholders have different information needs, an organisation can start by first identifying its audience and considering the purpose and the context of the interaction. Interacting with consumers 3.51 Organisations are encouraged to consider the information needs of consumers as go through the journey of interacting with Al , from considering whether to use an Al solution, to understanding how the Al solution works as they use it, to requesting for reviews on the decisions made by the Al solution: A typical consumer journey may entail meeting the following information needs of consumers: they they

Page 55:

MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK 55 a Making sure that consumers are aware that the products or services that are considering are Al-enabled. Such information could be provided as part of a general product description. b Providing information so that consumers know how the Al-enabled features are expected to behave during normal use_ The information could be provided in more detailed descriptions or specifications of product features. This, however; may not be necessary for every feature that is Al-enabled: Organisations are encouraged to identify those features where providing additional information in this manner will enhance consumer trust. Similarly, if Al is used in decision-making, information may be provided so that consumers understand how decisions made with the assistance of Al may affect them. This can likewise be provided through descriptions of how the service will be provided: For Al-enabled features that consumers interact with regularly, providing information so that understand why the Al-enabled feature is behaving in a certain way, and providing preference settings to allow consumers some influence over future behaviour where possible. As doing SO requires more engineering effort (such as in the providing additional user interfaces to user history), and the level of information provided may be somewhat more detailed and personalised than feature descriptions, organisations will have to decide which of their product features will benefit from provision of this level of detail: d. For Al-augmented decisions that affect consumers, consider providing additional information so that understand why the decisions were made; and for certain categories of such decisions, providing an appropriate channel to contest such decisions: The level of information that is provided will necessarily be detailed but this may not be necessary except for those scenarios where a customer is affected by the decision: they they they

Cost or trade-offs of alternative mechanisms; e Complexity and inefficiency of maintaining parallel systems; and t, Technical feasibility: 3.53 Where an organisation has weighed the factors above and decided notto providean option to optout, itisprudentforthe organisation to consider providing modes of recourse to the consumer such as providing a channel for  reviewing the decision: Where appropriate, organisations may also wish to a history of chatbot conversations when facing complaints or seeking recourse from consumers: Communication channels 3.54 Organisations are encouraged to in place the following communications channels for their customers: they during keep put

MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK 57 a Feedback channels This channel could be used for customers to raise feedback or raise queries: It could be managed by an organisation's Data Protection Officer (""DPO"") if this is appropriate. Where customers find inaccuracies in their personal data which has been used for decisions affecting them, this channel can also allow them to correct their data Such correction and feedback, in turn, maintain data veracity: It could also be managed by an organisation's   Quality Service Manager  (""QSM"") if stakeholders wish to raise feedback and queries on material inferences made about them: b_ Decision review Apart from existing review channels obligations, organisations can consider providing an avenue for individuals (such as an aggrieved consumer) to request a review of material Al decisions that have affected them: Where the effect of a fully-autonomous decision on a consumer may be material, it would be reasonable to provide an opportunity for the decision to be reviewed by a human: Testing the user interface 3.55 Organisations are encouraged to test user interfaces and address usability problems before deployment, so that the user interface serves its intended purposes: If applicable, organisations are also encouraged to inform individuals that their responses would be used to train the Al system a chatbot) Organisations should be aware of the risks of using such responses as some individuals may intentionally use bad language or random replies' which would affect the training of the Al system: Easy-to-understand communications 3.56 Organisations are encouraged to communicate in an easy-to- understand manner to increase transparency: There are existing tools to measure readability, such as the readability graph , the Gunning Index, the Flesch-Kincaid readability tests, etc: It would be helpful for decisions with higher impact to be communicated in an easy-to-understand manner; with the need to be transparent about the technology being used: Besides textual communications, organisations can also consider visualisation tools, graphical representations, summary tables, or a combination of these. The  priority is to convey your information, such as an explanation or interpretation, in a way that is understandable by an organisation's consumers and other stakeholders. (e.g. Fry Fog using

58 Acceptable user policies 3.57 In certain cases, organisations may be implementing Al-powered solutions that are also trained on real-life input data (i.e. active learning). These organisations may wish to consider setting out certain acceptable user policies (""AUPs"") to ensure that users do not   maliciously introduce  input data that unacceptably manipulates the performance andlor results of the solution's model: This is pertinent, given examples of Al chatbot systems that have been unduly manipulated to issue publicly- unacceptable responses. 3.58 In this regard, AUPs serve to set broad boundaries for the interactions that individuals can perform with the Al system, such as restrictions with regard to intentional actions or attempts to reverse engineer; disable, interfere or disrupt the functionality, integrity or performance of the Al-powered service. Interacting with other organisations 3.59 Some of the approaches and methodologies described in the preceding section are also relevant when organisations interact with Al solution providers (such as procuring Al solutions and obtaining regulatory approval) , or other organisations (such as facilitating industry collaboration, enabling interoperability of systems). Organisations would thus need to obtain sufficient information from Al solution providers to help them meet their business objectives (for example, this could be a back-to-back arrangement for providing the information described in paragraph 3.51). This could be as straightforward as obtaining the Al solution providers' support to provide the information"" and to build the features""1 necessary such that the deploying organisation can align itself to the Model Framework: For example, information related to lineage of the training dataset and documenting the steps in the model training and selection process For example, the user-facing interactions providing information about the expected behavior of an Al-powered feature and building the function to allow users to manage preference settings that influence how the Al-powered feature will perform for them in future: past key

MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK 59 3.60 Organisations may have to consider the level of support and detailed information that may need to obtain from Al solution providers pertaining to: a Data (e.g: types and range of data used in training the algorithm, source and quality of external training data); b Model training and selection (e.g. features and variables used and weights of the commercial models supplied, documenting the decisions made with respect to the model training and selection); C Human elements nature of human involvement in developing the algorithm, or in the decision-making process); d. Inferences (e.g: predictions made by the algorithm and how these are incorporated into product features or decision- making); e Algorithmic presence (e.g: where in the solution that an algorithm is used); and f Measures and safeguards in place to mitigate biases in data and algorithms: 3.61 Depending on the purpose and context, the type and level of detail of information required may be different: For example, a regulator may require a regulated entity to demonstrate that its model development and selection process is sufficiently rigorous, and the Al solution provider may be required to provide more information and be involved in the clarification process with the regulator: An industry collaborator; on the hand, may be more concerned with factors pertaining to compatibility and interoperability: Ethical evaluation 3.62 Finally, as ethical standards governing the development and use of Al evolve, organisations are encouraged to evaluate whether their Al governance practices and processes are in with evolving Al standards, and make available the outcome of such evaluations to relevant stakeholders: they key (e.g: line

62 MSD: ILLUSTRATION FOR STAKEHOLDER INTERACTION AND COMMUNICATION MSD is a multinational pharmaceutical company that deploys an in-house chatbot, Jennie, to answer queries on IT-related matters. Prior to deployment; MSD's User Experience (""UX"") team tested the human-AI interface and addressed usability problems to ensure optimal user interaction with Jennie. In particular; three tenets guided the development and deployment of Jennie: a. Understanding a user's mental model: The UX team conducted user research with   representative users to understand users' expectations when interacting with a chatbot. The research covered the scope of IT questions, expected answers and the kinds of answers provided (e.g: how technical the answers should be phrased). By building a user-friendly interface, users would be more comfortable to interact and use the chatbot: b. Taking a human-centric  approach: To understand patterns of human behaviour; the team analysed how its employees reacted when faced with challenges in interacting with the chatbot: Examples include how users formulate questions, whattypesofanswers satisfy usersandhow many times a chatbot should be allowed to attempt an answer: After understanding the human interaction touchpoints, the team used these insights to create an information flow architecture to deliver a better experience for users: C Managing the bot-human handover: There could be instances where Jennie mightnotbe able to provide a satisfactory answer: In such instances, the UX team determined that the chatbot would have a maximum of three attempts to provide a satisfactory reply, before forwarding the users request and chat logs to a customer care executive for follow-up. When employees engage Jennie, MSD will disclose on the landing page that Jennie is Al-powered and is a beta version which will improve over time (see figure below).

64 ANNEX A FOR REFERENCE: A COMPILATION OF EXISTING AI ETHICAL PRINCIPLES This annex comprises a collection of foundational Al ethical principles, distilled from various sources.12 Not all are included or addressed in the Model Framework: Organisations may consider incorporating these principles into their own corporate principles, where relevant and desired: 1 _ Accountability: Ensure that Al actors are responsible and accountable for the proper functioning of Al systems and for the respect of Al ethics and principles, based on their roles, the context, and consistency with the state of art: 2. Accuracy: Identify, and articulate sources of error and uncertainty throughout the algorithm and its data sources SO that expected and worst-case implications can be understood and can inform mitigation procedures 3. Auditability: Enable interested third parties to probe, understand, and review the behaviour of the algorithm through disclosure of information that enables monitoring, checking or criticism: 4. Explainability: Ensure that automated and algorithmic decisions and any associated data driving those decisions can be explained to end-users and other stakeholders in non-technical terms: 5. Fairness: a Ensure that algorithmic decisions do not create discriminatory or unjust impacts across different demographic lines race, sex, etc ). b To  develop and include monitoring and accounting mechanisms to avoid unintentional discrimination when implementing decision-making systems: C To consult a diversity of voices and demographics when developing systems, applications and algorithms.

MODEL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK 67 ANNEX B ALGORITHM AUDITS 1_ Algorithm audits are conducted if it is necessary to discover the actual operations of algorithms comprised in models: This would have to be carried out at the request of a regulator (as part of a forensic investigation) having jurisdiction over the organisation or by an Al technology provider to assist its customer organisation which has to respond to a regulator's request: Conducting an algorithm audit requires technical expertise which may require engaging external experts The audit report may be beyond the understanding of most individuals and organisations The expense and time required to conduct an algorithm audit should be weighed against the expected benefits obtained from the audit report: Ultimately, algorithm audits should normally be used when it is reasonably clear that such an audit will yield clear benefits for an investigation: 2 The following factors may be relevant when considering an algorithm audit: a The purpose for conducting an algorithm audit: The Model Framework promotes the provision of information about how Al models function as part of explainable AI. Before embarking on an algorithm audit, it is advisable to consider whether the information that has already been made available to individuals, other organisations or businesses, and regulators is sufficient credible (e.g: product or service descriptions, system technical specifications, model training and selection records, data provenance record, audit trail): b Target audience of audit results. This refers to the expertise required of the target audience to effectively understand the data, algorithm and/or models. The information required by different audience vary: When the audience consists of individuals, providing information on the decision-making process and/or how the individuals' data is used in such processes will achieve the objective of explainable Al more efficaciously: When the audience consists of regulators, information relating to data accountability and the functioning of algorithms should be examined first: An algorithm audit can prove how an Al model operates if there is reason to doubt the veracity or completeness of information about its operation: C General data accountability: Organisations can provide information on how general data accountability is achieved within the organisations This includes all the good data practices described in the Model Framework under Data for Model Development section such as maintaining data lineage through keeping a data provenance record, ensuring data accuracy, minimising inherent bias in data, splitting data for different purposes, determining data veracity and reviewing and updating data regularly: d. Algorithms in Al models can be commercially valuable information that can affect market competitiveness. For example, the algorithm may be a trade secret or may embody business rules that are trade secrets: If a technical audit is contemplated, corresponding mitigation measures should also be considered non-disclosure agreements). and (e.g:

Introduction Our modern society faces many challenges that endanger the survival of humankind such as global environmental problems, growing economic disparity, and the depletion of resources. Japan is the first country to tackle social issues confronting a mature society, such as the declining birthrate and aging population, labor shortage, rural depopulation, and increased fiscal spending: Artificial Intelligence (Al) is considered a technology to rescue society from these problems, to address the set  forth in the United Nation's   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and to build a sustainable world. with the establishment of Society5.0' whose purpose is to address social issues and economic  development AI, aims to revitalize its  society and economy, to be an internationally attractive society, and to contribute to the SDGs on a global scale. Similar to many other types of science and technology, AL will many benefits to society, but its   large impact on society calls for appropriate   development and implementation. In order to avoid or reduce the negative aspects in advance while making effective use of Alto benefit society, we should promote, together with the continued research and development (R&D) of technologies related to AI, a transformation into an AI-Ready Society"" where AI can be used effectively and safely: We need to redesign society in every way including Japan's human   potential, social  systems, industrial structures, innovation systems, and governance. Depending on the researcher; there are various ways of thinking about the definition of AI (Artificial Intelligence), a central theme of this document; and there is no clear definition at present: For example, the EC High-Level Expert Group defines AI as a system that performs intelligent operations (which may have some autonomy) in response to environment and input. However, the expression ""intelligent operation"" itself is somewhat vague and open for interpretation: Also, the AILOO Report' published in the United States in 2016 cites Nils J. Nilsson's definition4 of Al as a field of research according to which Artificial intelligence is that activity devoted to making machines intelligent,  and intelligence is that quality that enables an entity to function appropriately and with foresight in its environment"" but this definition is also highly ambiguous. In actuality, the vague definition of Al within the same report in and of itself has a positive side that is accelerating the study of AI. In light of these circumstances, although there is a certain consensus 0n what to judge as AI or AI technology, it does not appear appropriate at this time to define it more strictly. In addition, various technologies normally called ""Al"" are seldom used alone but instead are generally incorporated and used as of an information system. Advanced and complex Society 5.0 is the future society that Japan aims following the Information Society (Society 4.0). A society that realizes Society 5.0 is a sustainable human-centric society that implements AI, IoT (Internet of Things), robotics and other cutting-edge technologies to create unprecedented value, and a wide range of people can realize their own well-being while respecting the well-being of others High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG) ""Draft Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI"" and 'A definition of A: Main capabilities and scientific disciplines' European Commission, Directorate-General for Communication, December 2018.

information systems may incorporate a broad range of AI technologies; moreover; they may incorporate technologies reflected in the principles stated in this document: Based on these two premises, the principles herein may be regarded as applying to any ""highly complex information systems in general' that include any such technology: Given such consideration, we do not define a particular technology O system as ""Al"" , but regard Al as ""highly complex information systems in general' After discussing some of the impacts 0 society, we will present a set of A social principles and identify some issues to consider in AI R&D and social implementation: In order to make the ensuing Society 5.0 as effective as possible, it is essential for all relevant stakeholders to cooperate and interact closely with each other: 2

It means ""a society adapted to the use of Al"". For this purpose, society as whole needs to be transformed, including individuals, business organizations, and the social innovation environment_ Individually, for example, everyone should acquire appropriate Al literacy that allows them to use AI for work and life. In business organizations, meanwhile, corporate activities should be developed with strategies premised on the use of AI. In the social innovation environment, all information should be digitized in a form that allows for AI analysis, should be transformed into data, and should be maintained in a state in which it can be used for AI development and service provision: 3

2 Basic Philosophy AI is expected to contribute significantly to the realization of Society 5.0. We consider AI important not oly to return the benefits obtained from the efficiency and convenience of using AI to people and society, but also to use Al for the public ofhumanity as a whole, and to ensure global sustainability outlined in the SDGs through qualitative changes in social conditions and true innovation. We believe we should respect the following three values as our philosophy and build a society that pursues their realization. (1) Dignity: A society that has respect for human dignity We should not build a society where humans are overly dependent on AI or where AI is used to control human behavior  through the excessive pursuit of efficiency and convenience. We need to construct a society where human dignity is respected and, by using AI as a tool, a society where people can better demonstrate their various human abilities, show greater creativity, engage in challenging work, and live richer lives both physically and mentally. 2 Diversity & Inclusion: A society where people with diverse backgrounds can pursue their own well-being It is both an ideal in the modern world and major challenge to create a society in which people with diverse backgrounds, values and ways of thinking can pursue their own well-being while society creates new value by flexibly embracing them. Alis a technology powerful enough to uS closer to this ideal. We need to change the nature of society in this way through the appropriate development and deployment of AI 3 Sustainability: A sustainable society We need to use Al to create a succession of new businesses and solutions, resolve social disparities, and develop a sustainable society that can deal with issues such as global environmental problems and climate change. Japan, as a leading science and technology- oriented   country, has an obligation to strengthen its accumulated scientific and technological resources by utilizing Al and thereby contributing to the creation of such a sustainable society. good bring

3 Social Changes Needed to Realize_Society 5.0  AL-Ready Society"" Technologies  expected to contribute to the realization of Society 5.0 include AI; IoT, Robotics, and ultra-high-speed broadband communication networks. Even if it becomes possible to some extent to entrust complex processes to machines using AI, it is still necessary for humans to set objectives that answer the question ""What are we AI for?"" While AI can be used to better society, it might also be used for undesirable purposes Or in inappropriate ways unconsciously. For this reason; we are advancing technological developments in terms of   Human Potential, Social Systems, Industrial Structures, Innovation Systems; and Governance which can answer the question ""What are we using AI for?"" while paying close attention to their interaction with the progress of technology These five aspects are equally important in achieving Society 5.0. Human Potential In an ""AI-Ready Society"" that is responsive to the spread of Al to every corner of society, how human respond to AI is the to realizing society where AL can be utilized. To that end, the expected abilities and roles of people are as follows A) People should fully understand the advantages and disadvantages of AI. In particular; people should have the ability to recognize that biases are included in the algorithms andlor data that will become the information resources of AI, and for example, that these biases may be used for undesirable purposes. In addition, people should recognize that there are three types of data bias: statistical bias, bias caused by social conditions, and bias arising from malicious intent among AI users. B) It is preferred that the use of AL will create an environment in which many people can engage in highly creative and productive work. To that end, it is expected that a diverse range of people will acquire the ability to realize their own dreams and ideas with Als support despite many differences in origin, culture, taste, and so on. An education system that achieves these as well as social systems that contribute to their achievement must be realized. It is important to have sufficient human resources  with acquired application skills such as implementation and design of AI systems and basic knowledge of data and AI: These skills would be acquired in cross-disciplinary range of fields in combined and  integrated framework It is expected that such human resources will be the driving force of all activities in society, and that the capabilities of those people will contribute to the formation of an Al-based environment. Given the establishment of such a environment we must implement social systems that allow many people to live a richer and more fulfilling life. 2) Social Systems The use of AI will most likely accelerate the evolution of individual service solutions and create various benefits from improved efficiency and individualization. In order to embrace the full benefits of this change in society, it is necessary for entire social systems including health care, finance, insurance, transportation, energy, and others to flexibly change and respond to the evolution of AI This includes simple efficiency in light of existing socially accepted objectives (such as improved convenience and liberation from simple labor tasks) It also includes the realization of new value potentially created by diversification and fluidization of objectives and resolving negative outcomes such as inequality, widening disparity, social exclusion, and so on) that may result from the evolution of AI. To this end; we need to implement flexible architecture designs equipped with mechanisms for expandability, interoperability, developing improved social order; and s0 on, both in the software and the hardware aspects of each social Additionally, we need to establish common data 5 using beings key - fully goals living living system:

Page 7:

utilization   infrastructure for various  social systems, in particular to ensure interoperability and connectivity: 3) Industrial Structures In order for a diverse group of people to realize their assorted dreams and ideas, it is necessary for labor as well as employment and entrepreneur environments to be flexible and internationally open: For this reason, companies   should compete  fairly and promote  flexible  working styles, human creativity   should  continually be demonstrated   throughout  industries,  and investment in startup businesses should be promoted: Innovation Systems (environments that support innovation) It is necessary for universities, research institutions, industries, and the public at large to  participate in AIs R&D, utilization and evaluation across fields and  positions, stimulating each other; and creating an environment in which innovation can flourish: To that end, all types of data including real space data should be instantaneously and securely available at a level that Al can analyze. Additionally, it is advisable to ensure privacy and security so that everyone can provide and distribute data with ease, and for there to be an environment where they can benefit from the data that they have provided It is   advisable to accelerate the   desired   development of AI by establishing an environment in which those involved in R&D; including users, can safely conduct R&D and utilization of AI, and the of R&D and utilization can move rapidly. Preferably, the utilization of Al will create new ideas and possibilities, and significantly expand the potential of innovation. Governance It is always necessary to continue to update the content and defined purposes discussed in the above-mentioned sections Human Potential, Social Systems, Industrial Structures, and Innovation Systems in line with social changes and technological developments. For that reason, it is necessary to have a system that can be implemented and in place for various stakeholders, including government; industry, universities, research institutions, and the general public. Then will be able to work together on such matters as identifying issues, evaluating impacts, and making decisions 0 regulatory governance including rules, systems, standardization and codes of conduct: Additionally, it is necessary to listen to people, including those who have a difficult time having their opinions heard, in addition the various stakeholders, and to establish system that continuously addresses the most advanced social and technical issues. When implementing such governance, flexible and effective measures should be taken not only in terms of the law but also by means of industries with appropriate technical means taking the initiative. In addition, international coordination for governance is important, and in addition to governance in each individual country, an international system of cooperation for dealing with cross-border problems should be established. cycle they

Social Principles_of Human-Centric AI We recognize that in order to realize an AI-Ready Society"" and to promote an appropriate and proactive social implementation of AI, it is important to establish basic principles that each stakeholder should keep in mind. In order for AI to be accepted and properly used by society, we will systemize these basic principles into ""Social Principles of Al"" to which society (especially state legislative and administrative bodies) should pay attention, and ""R&D and Utilization Principles of Al"" to which developers and operators engaged in AI R&D and social implementation should pay attention: The ""Social Principles of Al"" necessary for realizing a society with the three basic principles listed in Section 2, and the ""R&D and Utilization Principles of AI"" that developers and business operators should consider, are as follows: 4 Social Principles of AI Social   Principles   of AI are principles   relating to social  frameworks that  should be implemented across Japanese society including national and local governments as well as in multilateral frameworks in an AI-Ready Society.' (1) The Human-Centric Principle The utilization of Al must not infringe upon the fundamental human rights guaranteed by the Constitution and international standards. AI should be developed, utilized, and implemented in society to expand the abilities of people and allow diverse people to pursue their own well-being: In a society making use of AI, it is desirable that we introduce appropriate mechanisms for literacy education and for the promotion of proper use of AI s0 that people do not become over-dependent on AI or misuse AI to manipulate other people's decision-making: AI can expand human abilities and creativity not only by replacing aspects ofhuman labor but also by assisting humans as a technologically advanced tool. When using AI, people must judge and decide for themselves how to use it. The appropriate stakeholders involved in the development, delivery and utilization of AI should be responsible for the consequences of AI utilization, depending on the nature of the problem: In the process of AI deployment, each stakeholder should take into consideration the user-friendliness of the system in order to allow all people to enjoy the benefits of AI and avoid creating a digital divide with so-called ""information or ""technology poor"" people left behind: The Principle of Education/Literacy In a society premised on AI, we do not desire to create disparities Or divisions between people O create those who are socially disadvantaged. Therefore, policy makers and managers of businesses involved in AI must have an accurate understanding of AI, knowledge and ethics permitting appropriate use of AL in society: They should take into account the complexity of Al and appreciate the possibility that AI could be intentional poor""

misused. AI users should have a general understanding of AI and should acquire sufficient education to use it   properly,  given that AI platforms are much more complicated than already developed conventional tools. Regarding developers of AI, meanwhile, it is of course necessary for them to master the basics of Al technology: Additionally, from the viewpoint of developing AI that is useful to society, it is important for developers to learn business models for how Al can be used in society, as well as to master a wide range of liberal arts such as social sciences and ethics including normative consciousness. From this point of view, we believe that an educational environment that fosters education and literacy in accordance with the following principles must be provided equally to all people. In  order to prevent generating disparities between people or to create socially vulnerable individuals, opportunities for education in a wide range of literacy skills are to be   provided in  early  childhood education and  primary and  secondary education. Opportunities are also to be provided for the reeducation of working adults and the elderly: With regard to literacy education and skills required to use AI, ur society needs an educational system that allows anyone to acquire the basics of mathematics, and data   science. All people need to learn beyond the boundaries of literature and science. It is also necessary to prepare content in literacy education on the limits of security and AI technology in order to raise awareness of AI and data characteristics. These characteristics include bias in data, the possibility of causing bias depending on how AI is used, and issues of fairness, impartiality, and privacy protection that are inherently needed in the use of AI: In a society where AI is pervasive, it is to be  expected that the educational environment will change from the current unilateral and uniform teaching style to one that makes use of individual interests and skill sets. For that reason, society as whole shares a sense that the education system is always changing flexibly to the optimal   form of teaching regardless of previous successful experiences in the educational environment to date. In education; it is desirable to have an interactive educational environment for the prevention of dropouts and an environment that fully utilizes AI technologies to allow students to work together: It is desirable not to impose an unnecessary burden only on the administration or schools (teachers), but to work independently with private enterprises and citizens toward the development of such an educational environment: The Principle of Privacy Protection Not all AI technologies increase the risk associated with the use of personal data, but in a society premised on A, it is still possible to gauge each person's political position, economic situation, personal hobbies, personal preferences, and so forth with great accuracy based on data about matters such as data subject's individual behavior. This means, when utilizing AI, that more careful discretion may be required than the mere handling of personal data in accordance with the level of importance and sensitivity of the data. Each stakeholder must handle personal data based on the following principles to ensure that no individuals are disadvantaged from the unexpected distribution Or use 8 AI,

Page 10:

of personal data in undesirable ways. We should make sure that any AI using personal data and any service solutions that use AL, including use by the government, do not infringe on a person's individual freedom, dignity or equality. Ifthe use of AI threatens to increase the possibility ofharming individuals, technical mechanisms and non-technical frameworks should be developed to reduce the risk: In particular; AL using personal data should have mechanisms to ensure accuracy and legitimacy, and to allow individuals to be substantially involved in managing the privacy of their personal data. This would make it possible for people to provide personal data with peace of mind when AI, and effectively benefit from the data they provide. Personal data must be protected appropriately according to its degree of importance and sensitivity: Personal data   contains a variety f information, ranging from matters that are highly likely to have a influence on an individual's rights and interests  (these  would typically be personal  thoughts, beliefs, medical history, criminal records, and s0 on), to matters that are semi-public in nature in a person's social life. Keeping this in mind, we need to pay close attention to the balance between the use of, and need for protection 0f, personal data based on the cultural background and common understanding of society. The Principle of Ensuring Security The active use of Al automates social systems and greatly improves safety. On the other hand, at least within the scope of currently available technologies, it is not always possible for AI to respond appropriately to rare events or deliberate attacks_ Therefore, the use of AI poses a new set of risks to security. Society should always be aware of the balance between the benefits and risks, and endeavor to improve social safety and sustainability as whole. Society must promote broad, deep research and development related to AI (from immediate measures to deep essential understanding) , such as the proper assessment of risks in the utilization of A[ and research to reduce risks. Society must make firm efforts to conduct risk management including the safeguard of cybersecurity. Society should always pay attention to sustainability in the use of AI Society, in particular; must not be uniquely dependent on just one type of Al or a few specific types of AI. The Principle of Fair Competition fair competitive environment must be maintained in order to create new businesses and services, to maintain sustainable economic growth, and to present solutions to social challenges. Even if resources related to Al are concentrated in a specific country, we must not have a society where unfair data collection and infringement of sovereignty are performed under that country's dominant position: Even if resources related to Al are concentrated into specific companies, we must using great many

Page 11:

not have a society where unfair data collection and unfair competition take place their dominant position: The use of AI should not generate a situation where wealth and social influence are unfairly biased towards certain stakeholders: The Principle of Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency In an ""AI-Ready Society"" it is necessary to ensure fairness  and transparency in decision-making, appropriate accountability for the results, and trust in the technology; so that people who use AI are not subject to undue discrimination with regard to personal background, or to unfair treatment in terms of human dignity. Under AIs   design   concept; all   people are treated fairly   without   unjustified discrimination on the   grounds  of diverse  backgrounds such as race, gender; nationality, age, political beliefs, religion, and so on. Appropriate explanations should be given on a case-by-case basis depending on the application of Al and each particular situation, including such things as when AL is used, how the AI data is obtained and used, and what measures have been taken to ensure the appropriateness of results obtained from Al operations. In order for people to understand AIs proposals and make judgments on them, there should be appropriate opportunities for an open dialogue, as required, regarding the use, adoption, and operation of AI Taking into account the above viewpoints and in order to use Al safely in society, mechanism must be   established to ensure trust   in AI, and in the data and algorithms that support it The Principle of Innovation To realize Society 5.0 and aim for continuous innovation that advances aS people evolve together with AI development; we   should transcend boundaries   such as national borders, industries, academia, governments, race, gender; nationality, age, political convictions and religion: We should promote total globalization, diversification; and industry-academia-government   cooperation in both human resources and research, based on a wide range ofknowledge, perspectives, ideas, and So on We must promote equal collaboration among universities, research institutions and companies, and the flexible movement of human resources. To implement AI efficiently and safely in society, methods for confirming the quality and reliability of AI, and for efficient collection and maintenance of data used by AI must be promoted. In addition to establishing Al engineering such as methods for the development; and operation of AI,it is necessary to promote the establishment and development of a wide range of studies such as ethical and economic aspects of AI. To ensure the sound development of Al technology, while securing privacy and 10 using being testing

Page 12:

security, it is necessary to establish a platform environment where data from all fields can be effectively utilized across national borders without monopolized. In addition, to promote research on AI, R&D environments should be established where computer resources and high-speed networks that promote international collaboration and accelerate Al are shared and used. The government must proceed with regulatory reforms to reduce impeding factors in all related fields in order to establish an efficient and beneficial society with the aid of AI technologies 42 AIR&D and Utilization Principles We believe that developers and business operators of Al should establish and comply with the AI development and utilization principles based on the fundamental philosophy and social principles of Al outlined above. Since many countries, organizations, companies, and so on are currently discussing AI development and utilization principles, we believe it is important to create an international consensus  quickly through open  discussions, and share results   internationally in a non- regulatory, non-binding framework: 5 Conclusion In order to lead the world in building the first AL-Ready Society,"" Japan should share the principles herein with the government, related industries, organizations, and so 0n, and reflect them in government policies. In addition, Japan should share these principles with other countries around the world and take a leadership role in international discussions with the of establishing an AL-Ready Society worldwide. In doing so, Japan should present to the world a social image of Society 5.0 that supports the realization of the SDGs, and should contribute to cooperative and creative new development of the international community. These principles should be flexibly revised in the future according to the progress of AI- related technologies, social changes, changes in the world situation, and many other factors 11 being goal

NATIONAL AI STRATEGY ROADMAP FOR THE PHILIPPINES Introduction The Fourth Industrial Revolution (FIRe) is set to transform industries at an unprecedented rate. It is a disruption that will change everything from products and processes to design philosophies and business models_a multifaceted  phenomenon   involving technology, people, and the environment. FIRe is supported by nine main technological pillars: Big Data and Analytics; Simulations, System Integration, Internet of Things (loT), Autonomous Robots, Cloud Computing; Cybersecurity, Augmented Reality (AR); and Additive Manufacturing: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been projected to drive 70% of FIRe, with blockchain and cloud computing accounting for the other 20%. In fact, according to PwC's recent report; Al could contribute a whopping USS15.7 trillion to the economy by 2030.2 In Southeast Asia, McKinsey reports that Al could be seen to open up opportunities in the region in that it could ""automate about 50% of the work activities performed in ASEAN's four biggest economies; which include the Philippines. Furthermore, in an October 2020 report by EDBI and Kearney, Al is expected to boost Southeast Asia's GDP by up to USS1 trillion by 20303 while Al will uplift the Philippine GDP by 12% in 2030 equivalent to USS92 billion.4 In this light; a strong focus on Al has significant potential to uplift the lives of Filipinos, local industries, and the national economy It is no question that Al can be expected to revolutionize many mundane aspects of our daily lives within the next decade  For one, the automotive industry will most likely be able to practically perfect autonomous vehicle  technology: The   synchronization of   vehicle movements will be straightforward, and it can be expected that tratfic congestion will be addressed and alleviated even in developing countries like the Philippines: Al-driven precision farming can also drastically decrease losses due to pests, and natural disasters, and can significantly increase outputs of high value products per hectare of land: Having the right people and technology to handle the above concerns will not only allow wealth generation but also ensure inclusivity, as these will address the need for shared basic infrastructure that citizens need to be productive and contented: housing; transportation; and food security, among others: Al is fueled by R&D and innovation: Hence, the Philippines benefits from favorable changes in the local innovation and startup ecosystem. In 2019, the local startup ecosystem ranked 54th out of 100 countries, an increase of 16 places from 2017.5 In 2020, the Philippines rose to the rank out of 131 economies (up from 54th in 2019) in the annual Global Innovation Index (GII), which has put the country in the 10 best-ranked lower middle-income economies #4 out of 29).

NATIONAL Al STRATEGY ROADMAP FOR THE PHILIPPINES However, there are still structural challenges that need to be addressed: Philippine Gross Expenditure on R&D (GERD, which is 0.16%/ of GDP) is still below the recommended expenditure of 1-2% of GDP. Specifically, the country has not been spending enough on education, R&D, and innovation linkages. Furthermore, investments in the Philippines, which is less than USSO.01 per   capita, is still the lowest among ASEANs major   economies: Data quality and  digital infrastructure remain underdeveloped, which are deemed hindering factors in the performance of the Philippines in Al and innovation rankings: Today, most enterprises and C-level executives worldwide are largely cognizant of Al's enormous impact on their business processes and products, but the Philippines is slow in this realization and its embrace of Al: To address these, the major barriers to Al adoption for most organizations and enterprises in the Philippines have been identified and recommendations outlined in this document: In this light; the National Artificial Intelligence (Al) Strategy Roadmap was formulated to guide government and private sector stakeholders in employing Al technologies and developing Al economies, while being mindful of the potential consequences and impacts of algorithms to processes and business models: Its overall focus is on how Al can be used to uplift the Filipino people, improve the productivity of local industries, and enhance the competitiveness of the national economy: The Roadmap is organized according to pillars (2) , strategic dimensions (4), strategic imperatives (7) , and strategic tasks (42).

NATIONAL AI STRATEGY ROADMAP FOR THE PHILIPPINES The Philippine Al Landscape The Philippines benefits from favorable changes in the local innovation and startup ecosystem. In 2019, the local startup ecosystem ranked out of 100 countries; an increase of 16 places from 2017.6 In 2020, the Philippines rose to the 50th rank out of 131 economies in the Global Innovation Index (GII) , which has the country in the top 10 best-ranked lower middle-income economies (#4 out of 29). The Philippine economy is among countries that have a high innovation input-output performance, placing it among the global brand outperformers quadrant of the GIl brand value matrix--i.e the Philippine economy has the ability to ""translate more effectively innovation inputs into innovation outputs:' This is an assuring development; giving firms more confidence in investing more in R&D and science to further accelerate innovation.

NATIONAL AI STRATEGY ROADMAP FOR THE PHILIPPINES Barriers to AL Adoption amongIndustries in the Philippines Most enterprises and C-level executives worldwide are already largely cognizant of Al's enormous impact on their business processes and products, but the Philippines is slow in this realization and its embrace of Al: To address these, the major barriers to Al adoption for most organizations and enterprises in the Philippines have been identified, as follows: 1 Lack of Understanding of Data Science and AI. organizations in the Philippines still have   insufficient   knowledge of what Al and Data Science are_ Hence, cannot conceptualize how this new technology and set of tools can help their business processes and products: Critically, are not willing to invest  money and other resources into something whose value and impact are not explicit nor tangible to them. Among those with a degree of familiarity to Al, concern about employee backlash due to the pace of change and job displacement tends to be an inhibitory factor. (2) Lack of Knowledge on Potential Use Cases. Perhaps another reason local industries and other organizations lack an understanding of the field of analytics is the scarcity of information on potential use cases of Al. While many concrete examples exist outside of the Philippines that are readily accessible via the news and from online resources, many local enterprises cannot connect or relate to these examples. Many still seem far-fetched to local enterprises and the workforce. There is a need more potential use cases that are locally generated, so as to paint a more compelling picture for local stakeholders: (3) Lack of Resources. The lack of  resources is categorized into two forms: equipment (computational resources) and manpower (human resources). First, many enterprises, mostly micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the Philippines are resource-challenged in terms of the capability to set up their own computational resource, including cloud computing resource, andlor even acquire business intelligence (Bl) software to aid them in their data and system analysis Second, most, if not all, industries in the country, especially those that have started to invest in Al and Data Science, have been restricted by the scarcity of data experts, which include data analysts, data scientists, machine learning engineers, data engineers, data architects, and data stewards, among others Furthermore, many of the data-skilled talents lack the required business skills to make Al R&D projects practical and profitable for the enterprises. Lack of Data Strategy. Data   Strategy or Al strategy is  essentially a vision for how organizations should invest their resources towards building capabilities in data science and Al, anchored particularly on each company's strategic imperatives and business objectives. A common  misunderstanding is that a data strategy is all just about the data and the technology U e.g,, howlwhat to collect; where to store, what Bl platforms to use, etc. Rather , it is about acquiring technologies and technical capabilities can help enterprises achieve their strategic It is potentially disastrous when   organizations pour significant investments into digitization without charting their data/Al strategy in alignment with their own Many they they how goals.

Page 8:

NATIONAL AI STRATEGY ROADMAP FOR THE PHILIPPINES corporate vision. This  could result  in enormous monetary and opportunity losses: This particular barrier is more prevalent in large enterprises that have the financial capacity to invest in digitization, which include the capability to solve use cases with ML, but do not have the right people who are both technically and business savvy to bridge the gap between technology and business: (5) Uncertainties about  Legal & Regulatory Framework for Al. By  setting out ethical boundaries to prevent indiscriminate and non-rights-respecting Al applications and protections for both customers and businesses, a clear legal and regulatory framework for Al will both protect the rights of Filipinos and spur responsible adoption of and innovations in Al. However, at the present, the Philippines lacks a complete framework for such: Indeed, as far as Al has been in the public statements of lawmakers, more emphasis has been placed on its potential disruptive effects such as job losses, especially in the financially important BPO sector: Fortunately, one component of the framework is currently present: the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173) , modelled after the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, offers robust protections for data privacy: Filling in the missing pieces of the puzzle is now the next step.

NATIONAL AI STRATEGY ROADMAP FOR THE PHILIPPINES TheNational AL Strategy In 2019, the Philippine Congress championed the approval of the Philippine Innovation Act (Republic Act No. 11293) , aiming to fund and support R&D efforts in the country towards national development: The Act's main objective is ""to generate and scale up actions in all levels and areas of education, training; research, and development towards promoting innovation and internationalization activities of micro, small and medium enterprises as drivers of sustainable and inclusive growth.' Consistent  with the law; the National Artificial  Intelligence (AI) Strategy Roadmap was formulated to guide government and private sector stakeholders in employing Al technologies and developing Al economies, while being mindful of the potential consequences and impacts of algorithms to processes and business models: Its overall focus is on how Al can be used to uplift the Filipino people, improve the productivity of local industries, and enhance the competitiveness of the national economy: Among the Roadmap's main objectives are: 1. To maintain the regional and global competitiveness of Filipino industries, noting that Al is one of the biggest drivers of innovation for enterprises; 2 To identify areas (in both R&D and technology application) for investing both time and resources of government; industry, and society, which includes harnessing existing global knowledge and new technologies that will aid in the development of new processes, products, and services for increasing productivity and for promoting overall public welfare; 3 To recommend ways for effectively fostering a triple-helix (R&D) collaboration among government; industry, and the academe, which is essential to national development; 4_ To suggest approaches for preparing the future workforce for the jobs of the future; and 5. To attract the biggest industries to set shop in the country, and thus generating more jobs for the Filipino people. The Roadmap is organized according to pillars (2) , strategic dimensions (4), strategic imperatives (7) , and strategic tasks (42). The pillars and dimensions have been defined so as to ensure that the country has clear metrics in terms of tracking the progress of its implementation towards transforming the Philippines into a globally competitive Al-driven economy: It is divided into two pillars based on the structure of the Global Al Index (GAII). 9 The first pillar is Implementation which reflects the   operationalization of Al by   practitioners in business, government and communities. The second pillar is Innovation which reflects  technology The Global Al Index. Accessible at: https IIwww tortoisemedia com/intelligencelglobal-ail: key

NATIONAL Al STRATEGY ROADMAP FOR THE PHILIPPINES breakthroughs and advancements in methodology that are indicative of greater capacity for Al in the future. Strategic dimensions comprise each pillar The first dimension is Digitization and Infrastructure as it is critical in achieving all the strategic goals defined in this Roadmap. The second dimension is Research and Development that includes as subset 'Investing in Strategic Sectors"" and 'International Collaboration.' The third dimension is the Workforce, which focus on anticipating and preparing for the potential impact of Al technologies by ensuring enough talents and skilled practitioners that can deliver Al solutions (more on application and implementation) and perform Al research (academic and industry-driven): This dimension will also cover both reskilling and upskilling of the workforce. Finally, the fourth dimension is Regulation, which protects human rights and puts into place equitable Al activating opportunities. Digitalization and Infrastructure; Workforce Development, and Regulation fall under the Implementation pillar of the Roadmap, while Research and Development is under the Innovation pillar. Each of the   strategic dimensions consists of   strategic   imperatives. For Digitization and Infrastructure, these are to (1) build a robust connected and networked environment; and (2) improve data access and data value  extraction: For Workforce Development, (3)  transform education and nurture future Al talents, and (4) upskill and reskill the workforce. For Regulation; (5) build an Al ecosystem conscience. And lastly for Research and Development; (6) master and boundaries of Al, and (7) accelerate innovation with Al by helping industries innovate through Al R&D, supporting and nurturing Al startups, and transforming institutions to maximize the impact of Al R&D: PILLARS STRATEGIC DIMENSIONS STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES STRATEGIC TASKS Build robust networked environment: Digitization & Infrastructure Improve data access and data value extraction.

NATIONAL Al STRATEGY ROADMAP FOR THE PHILIPPINES Digitization and Infrastructure 1. Build robust connected and networked environment The need for reliable and robust network   and internet connection is paramount to the transformation of the Philippines into a knowledge-based economy: This is crucial to support, sustain, and scale up Al and Data Science and Analytics (DSA) programs in the country. It is imperative that all localities should have fixed, reliable, and fast broadband speeds. The goal is for every household to have at least 1 Mbps download and upload capabilities and for critical zones economic, government offices, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) , and Research Development Institutions (RDIs) to have internet speeds that are at least within the global averages for mobile and fixed broadband (currently about 40 and 90 Mbps, respectively): Strategic Tasks: Build robust connected and networked environment 1 Make the internet equitable; i.e. more affordable for everyone. DICT Ultimately , ensure everyone has access to the internet: 2 Improve internet quality: DICT 3_ Ensure that industries, especially those in economic zones, have DICT, DTI access to reliable and secure networks that are at least within the global averages; that is, about 40 and 90 Mbps for mobile and fixed broadband currently: 4_ Ensure that government agencies and other public institutions have DICT, DILG access to reliable and secure networks. Government agencies, like for LGUs economic zones, must be considered as reliable areas for information access and transfer. 5_ Ensure that HEIs and RDls have access to reliable and secure DICT, CHED, networks: DOST 2. Improve data access and data value extraction Data accessibility be improved, and cross-sector data utilization be supported as it powers Al. In addition to opening up public datasets, the government also needs to explore how private datasets can be tapped and, at the very least; insights be democratized. MSMEs lament about the imbalance of power to larger companies due to data ownership and exclusivity: To help MSMEs, academic institutions, and the general public in this aspect, it is proposed to have both a National Data Center (NDC) and National Research Cloud (NRC): The NDC will house and secure government; private, and other publicly available datasets: It will be a one- stop-""data""-shop for governments, universities, and enterprises. On the other hand, the NRC will provide our academic researchers and MSMEs shared Al resources such as supercomputers 10

Extensive training of analysts and data scientists to extract and CHED, DTI; communicate actionable insights from data accessible from ST6. DOST Workforce Development 3. Transform education and nurture future Al talents The Philippines needs to invest in Al-enabling resources and develop a deep appreciation for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and DSA In particular , there is a need to include the DSA foundations (mathematics, statistics, and computing) in secondary education and general courses of data analytics, business analytics, and introductory Al in HEIs. The country must increase the number of research-oriented graduate students in business analytics , data science , and Al trained in quality Al and DS degree programs: It is also imperative to train competent and confident Al modules teachers with the help local and international organizations. Finally, local  academic institutions must be incentivized to have practitioners engage with graduate students to maximize impact of Al research to other fields: Strategic Tasks: Transform education and nurture future Al talents 13. Promote data literacy for all: DepEd; CHED, DOST 14. Ensure proper training of teachers in Data Science and Analytics DepEd, CHED, (DSA) DOST 15.

Build an Al Ecosystem ""Conscience"" Intellectual property (IP) laws and data-protection laws need to be strengthened to address potential ethical concerns on the use of both data and Al. Further; Al technologies need to be standardized. In this aspect, particular government champions need to work together including the National Privacy Commission (NPC) for data protection, the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL) for intellectual property protection, the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) for competition enforcement, and the DTI for consumer protection. 12

NATIONAL AI STRATEGY ROADMAP FOR THE PHILIPPINES Ways Forward Governance. A body that would steer and oversee the implementation of the Roadmap needs to be established; composed of government agencies, including the DTI, DOST, NEDA, DICT, CHED, TESDA and other champions from government; together with industry and academic representatives Funding: Al can be a good anchor to start justifying increased public spending for R&D; as it immediately has a multiplier effect and is aligned to future jobs and skill sets  Currently , the Philippines is spending less than 0.2%of GDP on R&D (USS 0.8 B), far from the global benchmark of 1% of GDP (~USS 3.75B) and Europe's Barcelona target of 3%.11,12,13 This places the Philippines second to the last compared to other countries in Southeast Asia. In fact, experts suggest that the Philippines should target at least 2% of GDP (~USS 7.4 B of ~USS 370B). National Center for Al Research (NCAIR): The National Center for Al Research (NCAIR) will serve as the countrys hub for Al research that will be instrumental in making the Philippines an Al Center of Excellence_ It will be responsible for advancing scientific discoveries in Al, including algorithmic innovations, nurturing and developing Al talent and Data Science leaders, and engaging in research and development (R&D) projects that address various socio-economic needs of society and industry: Given that the two pre-requisites to advance Al research are data and computing power, NCAIR is also expected to build and administer both the National Data Center (NDC) and the National Research Cloud (NRC): The creation of NCAIR is central to the implementation of the Al Roadmap as it will perform world- class industry-driven R&D activities and coordinate Al integrators in regional hubs previously identified by the DOST. In particular; NCAIR will serve as a focal hub for R&D collaboration between universities, industries, multinational companies, RDls, and startups. More importantly; one of the goals of NCAIR would be to assist MSMEs interested in using different DSA and Al tools to help them improve their efficiency and productivity through Al and data-driven science. Technical capabilities at NCAIR would initially include  algorithmic improvements in machine learning applications, natural language processing, deep learning, recommendation systems, sentiment analysis, public opinion monitoring, and computer vision. 11 Study on the State of S&T Development in ASEAN (2012), Volume 1, ASEAN: https Ilasean orglwp- contentluploads/2017/10/01-Study-on-the-State-of-S_T-Development-in-ASEAN-Vol-1-ASEAN-State pdf 12 Statistical Yearbook for Asia and the Pacific (2013).

Dr: Rajiv Kumar Vice Chairman National Institution for Transforming India Government of India New Delhi, India 4cud 074d FOREWORD The economic potential of deployment of Artificial Intelligence has been widely highlighted by policy makers, technologists, academics and civil society around the world. In India, the National Strategy on Artificial Intelligence (NSAI) released by NITI Aayog in 2018 highlights the potential of Al to solve social challenges faced by its citizens in areas such agriculture, health and education, in addition to the pure economic returns that are brought by this technology: Since 2018, the deployment of Al in India has only grown, through the support of enthusiastic state governments, research institutions, leading applications from the private sector and vibrant   evolving Al start-up ecosystem Though Al is often deployed with intentions of improving access and quality and higher efficiency and solving pressing problems, risks and challenges of leveraging A/ have also emerged across a number of different areas. Al is technology that continues to advance rapidly ad the discourse on Al ethics and governance is also evolving: Globally, a number of different sets of Al ethics principles' have been put forward by multilateral organizations, sector entities and various nation states_ For India, these principles are grounded in the fundamental rights afforded to citizens by the Constitution: Apart from establishment of principles however; it is also necessary for India to frame means of implementing the principles across the sector; private sector and academia in a manner that balances innovation and governance of potential risks. Building further on the National Strategy on Al, this approach paper; the first part of the strategy titled Towards Responsible Al for All"" , aims to establish broad ethics principles for design, development and deployment of Al in India drawing on similar global initiatives but grounded in the Indian legal and regulatory context The second part of the strategy which will be released shortly explores means of operationalization of principles across the sector; private sector and academia. Within this framework, it is hoped that Al can flourish, benefitting humanity while mitigating the risks and is inclusive bringing the benefits of Al to all The paper incorporates insights, feedback and experiences consolidated through inter ministerial consultations, large-scale global multi-stakeholder consultations and a series of 1-1 consultations with Al ethics experts in India and globally, as well as wider public consultations, conducted over the last 15 months. This paper is meant to serve as an essential roadmap for the Al ecosystem, encouraging adoption of A in a responsible manner in India and building public trust in the use of this technology; placing the idea of 'Al for All' at its very core: February, 2021 Owa New Delhi; India Dr. Rajiv Kumar 45 7134FrTI *7 31T private public public

Introduction ITI Aayog released the National Strategy for N Artificial  Intelligence (NSAI) discussion paper in June 2018, in pursuance of the mandate entrusted to it by the Hon'ble Finance Minister in the Budget Speech of 2018 2019. NSAI while highlighting the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for   accelerating   growth also emphasised the social potential of large scale adoption of Al with a focus on themes of inclusivity, adopting the theme of Al for All' . Towards promoting development as well as adoption of Al, the NSAI made broad recommendations for supporting and nurturing an Al ecosystem in India under four heads, (a) promotion of research; (b) skilling and reskilling of the workforce; (c) facilitating the adoption of Al solutions; and (d) the development of guidelines for 'responsible Al' . While underlining the role of private sector and collaboration, NSAI identified focus sectors where the Government was expected to play the lead, viz. health, education, agriculture, smart cities and mobility: NSAI recommended establishment of clear mechanisms to ensure that the technology is used in a responsible manner by instilling trust in their functioning as a critical enabling factor for large scale adoption in a manner that harnesses the best that the technology has to offer while protecting citizens Need for a fine balance between protecting society (individuals and communities) without stifling research and innovation in the field was underlined: The future of Al is determined by a diverse group of stakeholders, including researchers, private organisations, Government; standard-setting bodies, regulators and  general citizens: Around the world, various countries and organisations have defined principles to guide responsible management of Al for various stakeholders. 'Towards the Development of Responsible 'Al for All' , proposes principles for the responsible management of Al systems that may be leveraged by relevant stakeholders in India. Case studies of Al systems in India and around the 2 key

world are studied and the principles for responsible Al are derived from the Constitution of India and various laws enacted thereunder: The case studies and considerations in this paper are limited in context to 'Narrow Al' solutions. have been grouped into two broad buckets: 'Systems considerations' arising as a result of the system design choices and deployment processes, and have the potential to impact stakeholders interacting with a Al system; and 'Societal' considerations, that are broader   ethical challenges pertaining to risks arising out of the very usage of Al solutions for functions, and have potential repercussions on the society beyond the stakeholder interacting directly with specific systems. The Paper examines following system considerations: Lack of understanding an Al system's functioning makes it difficult to reliably and safely deploy Al systems Challenges in  explaining specific  decisions of Al systems makes it difficult to trust them Inherent bias could make the decisions prejudiced against segments of population Potential for exclusion of citizens in Al systems used for delivering important services and benefits Difficulty in assigning accountability Privacy risks Security risks; and following Societal Considerations: Impact on Jobs Malicious psychological profiling The Supreme Court of India, in various cases such as Naz Foundation and Navtej Johar has defined the prevailing morality of our country to be based on the principle of Constitutional morality: The Supreme Court has stressed time and on adherence to constitutional morality over social morality, with the formers reach extending beyond the mere text of the Constitution to encompassing the values of a diverse and inclusive society while remaining faithful to other constitutional principles The   Paper studies the various 3 They specific specific again

considerations under the lens of the Constitutions and identifies 'Principles for Responsible Management of Artificial Intelligence in India' . On the basis of Systems and Societal considerations, the Paper identifies the following broad principles for responsible management of Al: 1 _ Principle of Safety and Reliability 2  Principle of Equality 3_ Principle of Inclusivity and Non-discrimination 4_ Principle of Privacy and security 5_ Principle of Transparency 6_ Principle of Accountability 7_ Principle of protection and reinforcement of positive human values The manner and degree of implementation of principles must provide an enabling environment for promoting a responsible Al ecosystem in India. The measures may be suitably calibrated according to the risk associated with different Al applications in a manner that keeps pace with technology advances: This is an evolving area of work: NITI Aayog is already working on Part-2 of the Paper that would provide the approach towards ongoing update of Principles and enforcement mechanisms of the responsible Al in the sector; private sector and academia. This Paper is expected to be released shortly: consider this document to be a critical step towards #AlforAIl and hope it starts a dialogue on ensuring that the significant and transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence is used for the benefit of Indian citizens and humanity overall Amitabh Kant CEO, NITI Aayog specific public Wm)

The Need for Responsible Al rtificial Intelligence (Al) systems have gained prominence over the last decade due to their vast potential to unlock economic value and help mitigate social challenges: Thus not only the development but also adoption of Al has seen a global surge in recent years It is estimated that Al has the potential to add USD 957 billion, or 15 percent of current gross value added to India's economy in 20351. It is projected, that the Al software market will reach USD 126 billion by 2025, up from USD 10.1 billion in 20182. The rapid increase in adoption can also be attributed to the strong value proposition of the technology: The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence (NSAI) has successfully brought Al in the centre-stage of the reform agenda of the Government by underlining its potential to improve outcomes in sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, or education. Role that Al plays in facilitating improved scale of delivery of specialized services (remote diagnosis or precision agriculture advisory) and improved inclusive access to government welfare services (regional language chatbots or voice interfaces)   implies a whole new for  government interventions in these sectors. Further the NSAI underlines the need for a robust ecosystem that facilitates cutting edge research to not only solve for these societal problems and serve as the test bed of Al innovations but at the same time enable India to take a strategic global leadership by scaling these solutions globally: As these factors continue to favour the increased application of Al to a variety of private and use cases, it is expected that Al usage will become ingrained and integrated with society: In India, large scale applications of Al are being trialled everyday across sectors? .

cameras were installed for the 'Prayagraj Kumbha Mela' in 2019. The cameras would raise an alert when the crowd density exceeded a threshold, and the connected Integrated Command and Control Centres provided the security authorities with relevant information'. Wadhwani Al is testing an Al-powered smartphone-based anthropometry tool that will empower health workers to screen low-birth-weight babies without any specialised equipments. NIRAMAI, a startup, has developed an early-stage breast cancer detection system using a portable, non-invasive, non-contact Al-based device.6 Researchers from IIT Madras are looking to use Al to predict the risk of expectant mothers dropping out of healthcare programmes, to improve targeted interventions and increase positive healthcare outcomes for mothers and infants? . Box 1: Artificial Intelligence In this document, the scope and definition of Al is similar to the one mentioned in the National Strategy for Al, 2018 (NSAI, 2018)- a constellation of technologies that enable machines to act with higher levels of intelligence and emulate the human capabilities of sense, comprehend and act: Computer vision and audio processing can actively perceive the world around them by acquiring and processing images, sound and The natural language processing and inference engines can enable Al systems to analyse and understand the information collected. An Al system can also take decisions through inference engines or undertake actions in the physical world. These capabilities are augmented by the ability to learn from experience and keep adapting over time. This paper studies the ethical implications of 'Narrow Al' , which is a broad term given to Al systems that are designed to solve challenges that would ordinarily require domain experts Both systems and societal considerations are explored from the perspective ofnarrow Al only: Broader ethical implications of 'Artificial General Intelligence' (AGI) or Artificial Super Intelligence' (ASI) are not considered in this paper: Further; systems considerations considered in this document mainly arise from decisions taken by algorithms: Artificial Intelligence real showstopper of Kumbh Mela 2019 5 https:/ /wwwwadhwaniai.org/work/maternal-newborn-child-health/ https:/ /wwwniramai.com/ 7 //www.livemint:com/technology/tech-news/google-funds-six-ai-based-research-projects-in-in- dia-11582016278056.html speech. specific https:e

While the potential of these solutions to improve productivity, efficiency and outcome is well established, the NSAI (2018) also advocated for managing the Al systems responsibly: Around the world, instances of harm caused by deployment of Al systems have been realised: Al systems appear to have prejudices in certain decisions and this amplified when used in large scale, such as when the system to allocate healthcare in the USA was found to discriminate against black people8. The blackbox nature of A/ and its 'self-learning' ability make it difficult to justify its decisions and in apportioning liability for errors. Al systems often lack transparency and the user is unaware that are dealing with a chatbot or an automated decision-making system, this awareness being to build trust with the user: Safety and robustness of Al systems can pose serious challenges especially in high risk prone applications; unequal access to Al powered applications for marginalized populations can further accentuate digital divide. According to a Capgemini report, 85% of the  surveyed organisations in India have encountered ethical concerns from the use of A/"". There are also concerns of Al systems leading to job loss due to automation: The usage of Al for malicious intent for e.g: fakes to create misinformation have shown to have serious repercussions on society with instances of Al system enabled targeted propaganda, leading to social discord. The risks ofnot managing Al systems responsibly also has a significant economic impact  Multiple firms placed a moratorium on facial recognition technology after   issues   around bias  against  specific  population  groups   emerged? . A survey by Capgemini shows that ethical Al interactions drive customer trust and satisfaction- with Al systems that are seen as ethical have a 44 Net-Promoter-Score (NPS) advantage over the ones that are not: Over 50% executives agreed that it is important to ensure that Al systems are ethical and 41% of senior executives report to have abandoned an Al system due to ethical 10 concerns_ This paper aims to study the risks from the use of Al systems in India and around the world: In this regard, the impact of Al systems may broadly be divided into following two groups: https:/ /wwwnature com/articles/d41586-019-03228-6 9 https://gcn com/articles/2020/06/10/ibm-quits-facial-recognition.aspx 10. https:/ /WWW capgemini com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/A-in-Ethics_Web-pdf 8 gets they key deep point

a_ Direct impacts-defined as the implications that are caused due to citizens (or primary affected stakeholders') being subject to decisions of a Al system. These   typically result from system design choices, development and deployment  practices and are studied under Systems considerations. For example, Al for cancer screening needs consideration for the patients privacy in its design b_ Indirect impacts-defined as implications caused due to the overall deployment of Al solutions in society: This has potential repercussions on society beyond the stakeholder directly interacting with the system and are studied under Societal considerations. Such considerations may require policy initiatives by the Government: This document examines the potential risks, followed by a study of legislative practices and technology approaches of managing them and goes on to recommend Principles for responsible management of Al systems. The Principles are expected to safeguard interest and also promote innovation through increased trust and increased adoption. Besides establishment of Principles there is a need to formulate enforcement mechanisms that would ensure the   Principles are adopted across board, including the sector; private sector and academia in a manner that balances innovation and potential risks.

Exploring the Ethical Considerations he considerations in this section were chosen on the basis of expert consultations, desk review of examples of Al deployment globally, and interviews with agencies deploying Al solutions in India. The causes for considerations may be deeply interconnected and, in some cases, partially overlapping: Considerations have thus been divided in a manner that identifies distinct risks pose to various stakeholders. 10 they

Systems Considerations Box 2: The Blackbox problem While the advances in machine learning algorithms and techniques have greatly contributed to higher accuracy, the underlying Al systems have also become increasingly opaque: Such systems have been successful in using a large number of features to make complex and sometimes consequential decisions but without exposing the underlying rationale. In traditional statistical approaches, human programmers influence the choice of parameters and the mechanism to influence a prediction: In Al systems, input to the model (called features) are provided with the correct' output through annotated labels during the training: The Al system then identifies the relationship between input features and the labels. Understanding this relationship becomes harder as the models become increasingly complex This manifests itself as the inability to fully understand an Als decision-making process and the inability to predict the Al's decisions or outputs-also known as the black box problem' 11 The blackbox problem does not exist for all forms of machine learning solutions, and there are means of performing similar functions using more rule-based"" techniques, although the accuracy may be significantly lower The accuracy vs interpretability trade-off has limited the applicability of Al systems in several high-stakes decision making:12 One of the major global research efforts is around identifying models that are highly accurate and explainable. 13 11.

The considerations emerging from this property of  deep learning technology manifest themselves in several ways. For example, it is difficult to establish if an Al system can be deployed safely and reliably without understanding and  controlling how it works;   trusting an Al system's decision becomes a challenge if there is a disagreement due to lack of explanation; improving a model performance is difficult when the root cause is unknown.14 Systems Consideration 1: Understanding the Al system's functioning for safe and reliable deployment As mentioned in Box 2, machine   learning models learn by   identifying relationships between input features and output labels. Model evaluation is typically done by holding out a portion of the datasets as a test dataset: This may not necessarily reflect the various real world deployment scenarios and when the relationship between the input features and output is not understood, it becomes difficult to predict its performance in a new environment: This makes it difficult to reliably deploy and scale such Al systems. The Issue Its Implications While accuracy gives a reasonable The system could pick spurious view into how a system performs, correlations, in the underlying data, understanding decision making leading to accuracy in test process is important to ensure safe datasets but significant errors in and reliable deployment deployment Box 3: Wolf or Husky? In an example referenced in Ribeiro et al,, (2016)15,an image classification algorithm performed reasonably well in its prescribed task-classify the image of an animal as either a or a husky: When the model was analysed, it was found that the system was classifying images based on the background and not the animal itself. While the model performed reasonably well on the data used to test- it would clearly not do as well in the real world. 14 https://storage:googleapis com/cloud-ai-whitepapers/Al%2OExplainability%2OWhitepaper:pdf 15.

Left: Husky classified as Wolf. Right: Explanation- shows that the model is looking at the environment for classification. Systems Consideration 2: Post-deployment-can the relevant stakeholders of the Al system understand why a specific decision was made? While the previous consideration was on understanding the overall principles behind decision making, in certain cases, individual decisions may have significant impact and may require an explanation. There are various examples for such decisions-credit scoring, fraud detection, loan eligibility, insurance qualification, access to Government services, etc: As algorithms make these decisions, very often, an end user has an expectation of factual assessment: Particularly in blackbox systems, the user is sometimes neither aware of the inputs considered nor of the exact contours of the decision made by the algorithm. Such explanations also satisfy a strong imperative for reason giving, a component of procedural fairness in law.16 In addition to providing   explanations, the deployment environment and stakeholders interacting with the Al system should also be considered: The stakeholders may come from diverse backgrounds and the explanation offered by the system must be in a manner that can be understood by them: It is also important to note that the stakeholders are not only limited to the users, but also audit agencies, regulatory bodies, standard-setting entities, people affected by the decisions, etc: 16.

The Issue Its Implications With 'Deep Learning' systems Leads to: have become opaque, leading to A lack of trust by users, discouraging the 'bblack box' phenomenon; adoption; Simple linear models, offer Difficulty in audit for compliance and interpretable solutions but their liability; accuracy is usually lower than Difficult to debug/maintain/verify learning models; and improve performance; Inability to comply with sectoral regulations; Box 4: IBM Watson for Oncology The absence of explanation of output or decision may affect the adoption of the technology depending on the severity of implications In a deployment of IBM Watson, for  example in particular, Watson for Oncology-when Watson's results   agreed with physicians, it provided confirmation but didn't reach a diagnosis. When Watson didn't agree, then physicians simply thought it was wrong: This resulted in the system being abandoned in many hospitals around the world.17,18 Lack of understanding of in individual decisions has several consequences which discourages   adoption, especially for consequential decisions. Individual decisions are difficult to audit by regulatory, standards and compliance agencies besides the lack of redressal available to an aggrieved recipient given the difficulty in determining the grounds for challenging it in a court of law: For the developers of the system, identifying  specific errors and making improvements to its performance is a challenge as the inability to track the source of the error makes targeting interventions difficult: In cases where the law requires an explanation of individual decisions, it becomes prohibitive to use, even if the models are highly accurate: 17.

Systems Consideration 3: Consistency across stakeholders Though automated solutions are often expected to introduce  objectivity to decision making, recent cases globally have shown that Al solutions have the potential to be 'biased' against sections of society: This can lead to inconsistent output across a diverse demography who are otherwise similarly placed: Real life manifestations of such bias tie into historically discriminatory behaviour; where members of a certain caste, class, sex r sexual orientation, among others , are denied  opportunities on the basis of an identifying characteristic even though are completely similar in all ways relevant to the decision being made:""9 The emergence of bias in Al solutions is attributed to a number of factors from various decisions taken across different stages of the lifecycle and the environment in which the system learns. In more rule-based machine learning techniques, the performance of the Al solution is largely dictated by the rules defined by its developers In deep learning methods, the performance of the solution is defined by the data used, models chosen, parameters used, defined, etc, and the inherent complexity of such models makes it difficult to identify sources of bias. While individual human decisions are not without bias, Al systems are of particular interest due to their potential to amplify its bias across a larger population due to large-scale deployment: The Issue Its Implications Different types of cognitive biases Large scale deployment of AI, have been identified and tend leads to a large number of high to be unfair' for certain groups frequency decisions, amplifying (across religion, race, caste_ the impact of unfair bias. gender; genetic diversity); Leads to lack of trust and Since Al systems are designed disruption of social order and trained by humans, based on examples from real-world data, human bias could be introduced into the decision-making process; 19 https://wwwbrookings edu/blog/techtank/2019/11/18/highlights-addressing-fairness-in-the-context-of-artifi- cial-intelligencel 15 specific they arising goals specific

Box 5: Bias in the real world Bias has already led to instances of discrimination in the real world. In 2015 Amazon  experimented a machine learning-based solution to evaluate applicants by observing patterns in resumes submitted to the company a previous 10-year The system rated male applicants higher than females because historically, there was a higher number of male applications and trends in the data showed a historical preference for male candidates, as well: In effect, Amazon's system taught itself that male candidates were preferable Another example that has made headlines recently was when a passport checker used Al to check if a person has blinkedi. This model, however had issues when checking people of Asian descent- which was mostly attributed to the lack of Asian faces in the training dataset Systems Consideration 4: Incorrect decisions leading to exclusion from access to services or benefits Al systems are inherently probabilistic systems and it is uncommon to find systems that are 100 percent accurate in their predictions For consequential decisions, like the   beneficiary identification   system, criminal identification system, the social cost of an incorrect decision is very high and typical performance indicators may not be sufficient: In a beneficiary identification system, an incorrect decision could lead to exclusion of services and benefits guaranteed by the State and in criminal identification systems, it could lead to loss of fundamental rights. When the Al systems are used, particularly for critical services by the Government, it is important to have processes and systems in place for raising an objection. The 'systematic' exclusion from access to services and benefits could undermine trust in the system: General lack of awareness could also lead to over-dependence due to false or exaggerated belief in such technologies (automation bias) and may further aggravate the problem.21 typical approach towards this is to introduce a human intervention whenever such consequential decisions are made. 20. https:/ /www.reuters com/articlelus-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool- that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCNIMKO8G 21 . https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2004-6313 16 periodzo. photo

The Issue Its Implications There are a variety of means of assessing lead to exclusion or evaluating the performance of an of citizens from services Al system (Accuracy, precision, recall, guaranteed by the state; sensitivity, etc); In some cases, despite a high accuracy a system may fail in other measures; Box 6: Ensuring no one is left behind- Fraud Detection in Health Insurance National Health Authority (NHA) is the apex   body  responsible for implementing India's health insurance scheme under Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY) It is established at the national level and implementation is carried out by the State Health Agencies. Beneficiaries can avail cashless treatment at of the empanelled hospitals across India and PM-JAY makes the payment directly to the hospital. The NHA includes a fraud detection cell atthe national level called National Anti-Fraud Unit (NAFU) and at the state level it is called State Anti-Fraud Unit (SAFU): A_ large number of transactions are processed for insurance claims on a daily basis. To detect and flag fraudulent transactions, Al systems are employed. Considering the high social cost of a potential incorrect   decision, no treatment is stopped because of flagging by the Al system. When the Al system a case, the reasons for flagging is forwarded to the SAFU and investigated. While the patient always receives treatment without delay; the payment is disbursed to the hospital only after all the queries related to the case are adequately resolved. The AI has been developed by a vendor hired through a RFP The RFP document emphasizes the need to minimize false positives in the system.

total amount of cases: On the other hand, in order to ensure genuine fraudulent cases do not pass undetected, a minimum criterion is defined for the total number and the total value of fraudulent cases identified by the Al system?2. Systems Consideration 5: Accountability of Al decisions This consideration emerges mainly in more opaque forms of Al in which a decision, action or inaction of the system is influenced by a variety of parameters, such as data used for training, algorithms, processes, training parameters, deployment environment etc Different entities may be involved in each step of the development and deployment process In self-learning systems, the deployment environment  itself  could influence the decision- process The 'many hands problem' , associated with complex computer systems, complicates the issue of assigning responsibility under extant regimes of accountability and  legal recourse. Establishing cause of action is the first step of a civil suit and an opaque Al system coupled with a large number of interconnected factors  behind individual   decisions makes it  difficult for attribution of errors and assigning liabilities.23 Examples of real-world instances of such issues is presented in Box 7 and Box &. The Issue Its Implications Decisions by Al systems are Lack of consequences reduces influenced by a complex network incentive for responsible action of decisions at different stages of its lifecycle. Difficulty in grievance redressal Deployment environment also influences self-learning Al Assigning accountability for harm from a decision is a challenge 22 RFP; ""Selection of an agency to design, develop, implement, operate and maintain Fraud Control Analytics Platform for National Health Authority 23. https:/ /stanford library sydney edu.au/archives/sum201O/entries/computing-responsibility/#2.2.1 18 specific making specific

Box 7: The case of Elaine Herzberg In 2018, Elaine Herzberg was hit by a test vehicle operating in a self-driving mode. The collision led to the first recorded case of fatality involving a self-driving car: The Advanced Technology at Uber Technologies had modified the vehicle with a proprietary automated driving system. human-backup safety driver was sitting in the car during the collision but was looking at a cellphone during the crash: The road was and illuminated by the street light: Following the collision, the National  Transport   Safety Board (NTSB) launched an investigation and identified the following: The Uber ATG automated driving system detected the pedestrian 5.6 seconds before   impact: Although the system continued to track the pedestrian until the crash, it never accurately identified the object crossing the road as a pedestrian or predicted its Had the vehicle operator been attentive, the operator would likely have had enough time to detect and react to the crossing pedestrian to avoid the crash or mitigate the impact: While Uber ATG managers had the ability to retroactively monitor the behaviour of vehicle operators, rarely did so_ The company's ineffective oversight was exacerbated by its  decision to remove a second operator from the vehicle during testing of the automated driving system. Uber ATG made several changes to address the deficiencies identified, including the implementation of a safety management system?4 In this situation, it was difficult to ascertain liability (safety driver or ATG group or the technology itself). After the incident, Uber stopped testing its self-driving vehicles across all cities The incident also caused other companies to cease road testing of their self-driving vehicles?s.

Box 8: Investment management In 2017, Hong Kong-based Li Kin-kan let an Al-led system manage $250 mn of his own cash and additional leverage from Citigroup Inc, totalling up to $2.5 billion. The Al system was managed by London-based Tyndaris Investments. system was developed by an Austria-based company: It works by scanning through online sources like real-time news and social media and makes predictions on US stocks. By 2018,the system was regularly losing money, including over $20 mn in a single The investor decided to sue Tyndaris Investments for allegedly exaggerating the Al's capabilities  27 In this case, assigning liability- across developers, marketers and users of the system- is not straight-forward: The existing legal systems allocate responsibilities for action and consequences assuming a human agent While some legislations and protocols dealing with the regulation of technology and data are focused more on ensuring that accountability is built into the system, providing accountability of a remedial nature for Al systems is not easy: The overall lack of consequences may also lead to reduced incentives for responsible action. Systems Consideration 6: Privacy risks Al systems rely on large amounts of training data and when an individual's personal data is used there are bound to be considerable privacy concerns Lack of adequate privacy safeguards may permit technology to wholly record and analyse an individual's personal life without their consent or knowledge, significantly harming an individual interest by disregarding their preferences on the use of data. Such harm may be economic stealing an individuals credit card information; or emotional where an individual's personal details is the subject of discussion.

The Issue Its Implications Al is highly reliant on data for training, Infringement of Right including information that may be personal to Privacy and/or sensitive (PII) , giving rise to: Risk that entities may use personal data without the explicit consent of concerned persons; Possible to discern potentially sensitive information from the outputs of the system; Box 9: Privacy and Al Using facial recognition technology for surveillance: Clearview Al, a start-up based in the USA, gained attention around the world following a New York Times article. The company trained Al models to recognise people from over 3 billion images scraped from social media platforms and provided the technology to law enforcement agencies. The company website states that their mission is to provide assistance to law enforcement agencies for the identification of criminals: In many cases, law enforcement agencies have cited successin using the software to identify criminals-despite having limited knowledge of how it works28. Several civil groups in the US have raised objections particularly around the known vulnerabilities in facial recognition technology and possibility of mass surveillance for malicious purposes.29 Social media sites from which data was scraped also issued cease-and-desist' notice against the company for violating the terms and for data use.30,31 Model inversion: Machine learning models may sometimes use sensitive and personal information for training and the model itself may be available for general use: However; research has shown ways in which the training data can be inferred from the trained model. This is particularly relevant for 'ML-as-a-service"" models that are trained on a large number 28. https:/ /wwwnytimes com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition html 29. https://aboutblawcom/Oqa 30. https:/ /wwwbbc com/news/technology-51220654 31. https://www.cnetcom/news/clearview-ai-hit-with-cease-and-desist-from-google-over-facial-recognition- collection/ 22 policies

of potentially personal and sensitive datasets: This technique has been demonstrated to be able to infer personal and sensitive information from non-personal data- sensitive genomic information was   identified from patient demographic and dosage data. Fredrikson et al. (2015) also demonstrated the ability to extract dataset images that were used to train a facial recognition system.32,33 Left: Generated image from the Al model. Right: Image used for training the model Membership inference attack: Shokri et al (2017) proposed membership inference attack through which it is possible to know if a particular dataset was used for training a model: This is possible even when the model architecture and parameters are not known. This can lead to a privacy breach as, for example, knowing that a person's clinical record was used for training a diagnostic model could mean that the person had the disease.34 Systems Consideration 7: Security risks Security risks in Al systems arise from its reliance on data and from its design and deployment environment: Some of these attacks are unique to machine learning systems and affect different parts of the machine learning development cycle. Adversarial machine learning attacks are designed to take advantage of vulnerabilities in the machine learning model with potentially harmful real- world consequences: 32. Fredrikson, Matt, et al.

Researchers have found, for example, that by carefully manipulating even less than one percent of an image, it was possible to cause the model to make mistakes in classification26.

Societal Considerations Malicious Use of Al he Cambridge Analytica scandal that broke out in 2018 is a quintessential example of the real-world consequence of  privacy breach and the impact of psychological profiling: The data from millions of users was used without their consent, to sway opinion on matters of national and political interest around the world. This was facilitated through a Facebook app called This is your Digital Life' that users to take a psychological survey: Users logged in through Facebook and the survey responses were captured along with the user's likes and information. In addition to this, the app also information on the user's Facebook friends. The allegation was that the data was used to create psychological profiles of users by corresponding answers to the survey with Facebook information: This profiling was used to target political campaign messages. While this gained media attention for its role in the US Presidential elections, subsequently, its involvement in other countries was revealed: This included its role in the Brexit campaign, elections in Thailand, Indonesia and its role in Indian elections. This episode was a watershed moment for data protection around the world: Facebook confirmed that; though only 2,70,000 users had provided consent and downloaded the app, by tapping into the users friends network, information of up to 87 million users was used. Of these, 5,62,455 users were from India38. It also highlighted the role of Al in enabling profiling and ease of spreading targeted messages: It was alleged that the psychological profiling further helped in transmitting fake news to the susceptible population and was used as a 'propaganda machine' . This was seen as a violation of the fundamental user choice and democratic process around the world. Impact on Jobs The rapid rise of Al has led to the automation of a number of routine jobs. 38. https:llabout fb.com/news/2018/04/restricting-data-access/ 26 public paid profile pulled profile Kenya,

Legal and Regulatory Approaches for Managing Al Systems

Page 38:

Legal and Regulatory Approaches for Managing Al Systems Malicious Use of Al he previous sections highlighted a number of ways in which Al systems may impact the rights of citizens: It must be noted, however; that not all of these concerns are new relating to an emerging technology but already exist in various forms. In certain high-risk sectors such as health and finance, various sector legal protections and guidelines for products and services exist: However; a simple applicability of these laws to Al-based decision-making processes may not be appropriate: For aspects of algorithmic decisions, new legal protections may be needed: For example, while no anti-discrimination law directly regulates decision making by Al, the extant laws are equally silent about the means of decision-making that do govern41. Therefore , it will fall within the jurisdiction of anti-discrimination legislation to regulate decisions arrived at through the use of Al as well; particularly when the decision-making Al is being used by an entity having constitutional or legal obligations to be unbiased: In the study of regulatory and legal approaches, it is important to identify the role legislation may play: The greatest risk of adopting this approach to manage Al systems is that regulations have historically not kept pace with technology: Al is still an evolving field and the risks are not well understood, making it difficult to design concrete  long term regulatory   approaches. Regulating Al is a complex topic and there are diverse views regarding what degree and what forms of regulation will be effective for its varied applications. Al is a rapidly advancing technology, and a one size fits all approach may not be the most suitable approach. There is a need to balance soft governance measures with regulation depending on the use case and risks involved. 42 While 41.

overarching Al ethics principles will guide the overall design, development and deployment of Al in the country, a graded risk-based approach to varying use cases across different sectors need to be adopted: At the same time, the Al ecosystem has multiple stakeholders- private sector, research, government, legal bodies, regulators, standard setting bodies, etc It is important to bring in a common understanding on acceptable behaviour among different stakeholders and clarify applicability of existing policies and regulations through creation of Principles and guidance framework. Principles offer a technology agnostic framework for communicating expectations from responsible Al systems and identifying governance mechanisms Some relevant legislation for protection from Al related concerns exist in certain cases but would need to be adapted to cater to challenges posed by Al. Some sectors have unique considerations that may require sector laws for AI. Moreover; the review of Al ethics principles and guidelines will need to be done on an ongoing basis given the rapid pace of development of this emerging technology: Global Approaches Around the world, countries have identified a broad framework   through Principles and other guidance documents to guide the design, development and use of Al systems: Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Al released by the High Level Expert Group in the European Union is a non-binding document that proposes a set of 7 requirements that Al systems should meet in order to be deemed 'trustworthy' 43 Along similar lines, Singapore has a Model Al Governance Framework44 and the United States of America has Principles for the Stewardship of Al Applications. 45 In addition to the overall guidance  framework, actions have been identified in  high risk sectors to guide their development and adoption: These are also   typically non-binding and ensure that sector-specific issues are considered. 'FEAT Principles' for Al in financial services, released by Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) serves as a non-prescriptive guidance document to encourage adoption of fair, explainable, ethical, and accountable 43. https lleceuropaeu/digital-single-market/en/newslethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai 44. https:/ /wwwpdpc-govsg/help-and-resources/2020/01/model-ai-governance-framework 45. https://www.whitehouse-gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Draft-OMB-Memo-on-Regulation-of-Al-1-7-19-pdf 30 specific key specific The

Al.46 European Union has identified certain sectors as high risk and suggests an oversight mechanism. Binding regulations and acts of the Parliament are generally reserved for aspects that have been well understood. Globally, such instruments mostly cover data protection and are not restricted to just Al systems. The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) 2012 released by the Personal Data Protection Committee (PDPC) in Singapore establishes a data protection law that comprises various rules governing the collection, use , disclosure and care of personal data: General Data Protection Rules (GDPR) 2016, in the EU is a regulatory framework for protection of personal data and establishes the need for 'privacy by design' when developing automated solutions. In the USA, the Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2019 is a proposed bill that requires specified commercial entities to conduct assessments of high-risk systems that involve personal information or make automated decisions, such as systems that use artificial intelligence or machine learning.47 The USA also has the HIPAA Privacy Rule (2000) and Graham Leech Bliley Act (1999) for the governance of data in healthcare and finance respectively: Status in India Currently, India does not have an overarching guidance framework for the use of Al systems. Establishing such a framework would be crucial for providing guidance to various stakeholders in responsible management of Artificial Intelligence in India: There are certain sector specific frameworks that have been identified for development and use of Al. In finance, SEBI issued a circular in Jan 2019 to Stock Brokers, Depository Participants, Recognized Stock Exchanges and Depositories and in 2019 to All Mutual Funds (MFs) Asset Management companies (AMCs) Trustee Companies/ Board of Trustees of Mutual Funds/ Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) on reporting requirements for Artificial Intelligence (Al) and Machine Learning (ML) applications and systems offered and used.

The closest to this is the draft Personal Data Protection Bill (2019) (PDP) designed as comprehensive legislation outlining various facets of privacy protections that Al solutions need to comply with. It covers limitations on data processing, security  safeguards to protect data breaches and the provision of provisions relating to vulnerable users such as children: Additionally, the PDP Bill provides for a vibrant data protection legislation where the law shall be supplemented with regulations and codes of practice, thereby making it easier for privacy to evolve with evolving technologies For example, if a certain aspect of privacy regarding Al requires clarity, the Authority may simply issue a code of practice to provide the same: As of writing of this paper; the PDP bill is yet to be passed: The Information   Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) is the backbone of data protection legislation in India.

Technology Based Approach for Managing Al Systems discussed in the previous section, guidance framework or Principles 4 may serve to set expectations on responsible management of Al systems. It is also important for technology to respond to these expectations. The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence (2018) advocates for leveraging technology to manage Al systems responsibly: Technology has the potential to be agile and respond to evolving requirements. There has been a growing interest in using technology and statistical methods to address Al-related considerations-increasing not only the body of research in the field but also promoting a sense of responsibility amongst solution developers in academia and industry:   Figure shows the increase in the number of papers on 'ethical' topics is on the rise in Al, robotics and Computer Science related conferences in the last decade.

Principles for Responsible Management of Al Systems he previous section identifies the need for   guiding principles for responsible management of Al in India. The principles are expected to serve as a guide for various stakeholders in the Al ecosystem. These principles, to be effective, must be grounded on the nation's accepted value system and compatible with International standards. Different stakeholders of the Al ecosystem shape the future of Al, and it is essential to have a common set of principles which can guide all stakeholder groups towards responsible AI. Box 11: Al ecosystem stakeholder groups Different Groups shape the future of Al The Government Citizens Regulators Develop policies that may impact Al Influenced by Al systems, Oversee sector specificl sector agnostic Procure Al systems either directly or indirectly rules and regulations Private sector Research Community Standard Setting Bodies Develop Al products and solutions Research across social sector; Set standards for research or technology Use Al products and solutions regulation; technologies that use Al.

with the former's reach extending beyond the mere text of the Constitution to encompassing the values of a diverse and inclusive society while remaining faithful to other constitutional principles: Constitutional  morality has been described as the basis on which the rights of minorities can be in the face of majoritarianism, and is to be followed over societal morality, especially when the latter infringes the basic rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India (Constitution). Box 12: Considerations in the context of Constitution of India The considerations mentioned in the previous section also find expression in the Constitution under Fundamental Rights The relevant articles are summarized below, Article 14: Right_to_Equality The Constitution guarantees equal treatment of equally placed persons and groups before the law, and equal protection of the law to all. Articles _ 15 & 16: Right against Discrimination The Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion, race_ caste, sex, descent, place of birth or residence in matters of education, employment, access to spaces, etc: While the Constitution prohibits discrimination based on certain markers, it also provides for positive discrimination in the form of affirmative action: Article 15, while prohibiting discrimination, empowers the Government to make provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, and to make provisions for their admission to educational institutions, whether private, aided or unaided: Article 21: Right to _Life and Healthcare The Constitution guarantees the right to life to all persons. Various High Courts have read the right to healthcare, including the right to avail health insurance, to be part of the right to life. Article 21: Right _to _Privacy The Supreme Court has held that the right to privacy is an intrinsic part of 39 upheld public special

the right to life and guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution and as part of the freedoms enshrined in Part IIl thereof. Article _38: State Directive for Economic Equality The Constitution directs the State to ensure economic welfare of the people and minimise inequalities in income, status, facilities and opportunities, both between individuals and between groups of people. The State is also directed to ensure a wage for all workers, including agricultural workers. Tansparency and accountability The Supreme Court, in its interpretation of the Constitution, has held that transparency in decision making is critical even for private institutions. The Constitution guarantees accountability of all State action to individuals and groups. Box 13: Creation of Principles Principles were developed after consultation with diverse set of stakeholders Al case studies in India and Instances of harm caused by Al systems around the world were studied to identify around the world relevant considerations in Indian context Supreme court; in various instances, has defined the prevailing morality of India to Rights according to the Indian be based on the principle of Constitutional morality.

Risks to all stakeholders should be minimized and appropriate grievance redressal, care and compensation structures should be in place, in case of any unintended or unexpected harm: The Al system needs to be monitored through its lifecycle so it performs in an acceptable manner; reliably, according to the desired goals. 2 Principle of Equality: Al systems must treat individuals under same circumstances relevant to the decision equally 3. Principle of Inclusivity and Non-discrimination: Al systems should not opportunity to a qualified person on the basis of their identity: It should not deepen the harmful historic and social divisions based on religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth or residence in matters of education, employment; access to spaces, etc: It  should also strive to ensure that unfair exclusion of services or benefits does not happen. In case of an adverse decision, appropriate grievance redressal mechanism should be designed in a manner affordable and accessible to everyone irrespective of their background. 4. Principle of Privacy and Security: Al should maintain privacy and security of data of individuals or entities that is used for training the system: Access should be provided only to those authorized with sufficient safeguards. 5. Principle of  Transparency: The   design and  functioning of the Al system should be recorded and made available for external scrutiny and audit to the extent possible to ensure the deployment is fair; honest, impartial and guarantees accountability: 6. Principle of Accountability: AII stakeholders involved in the design, development and deployment of the Al system must be responsible for their actions. Stakeholders should conduct risk and impact assessments to evaluate direct and indirect potential impact of Al systems on end- users, set up an auditing process (internal and if required external) to oversee adherence to principles and create mechanisms for grievance redressal in case of any adverse impact 41 deny public

7. Principle of protection and reinforcement of positive human values: Al should promote positive human values and not disturb in any way social harmony in community relationships It is important to ensure that these Principles are updated in the future to reflect the latest knowledge, innovation and technology advances. A mechanism for the same and a framework for the enforcement of these Principles will be in Part 2 of the paper: Subsequent versions will also explore policy interventions for Responsible AI: 42 explored specific

Appendix 2 Review of Global Regulatory Landscape European Union The EUs Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Al is based on an approach founded on fundamental  rights. It offers   sector-agonistic  guidelines that require Al practitioners to respect the proportionality between means and ends, and carefully create a balance between competing interests and objectives: It also states that the development; deployment and use of Al systems must account for both substantive and procedural fairness. Under General Data Protection Regulation, 2016 (GDPR), entities processing personal data or determining the means for the processing of personal data are required to implement technical and organisational measures that ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk involved in processing such personal data These measures include the pseudonymization and encryption of data; preserving the confidentiality, integrity and resilience of processing systems and services; and restoring the availability of, and access to, personal data in a timely manner The EU Cybersecurity Act, 2019 (Cybersecurity Act) entrusts the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) with the responsibility of developing certification frameworks for cybersecurity, including the development of sectoral frameworks for cybersecurity with regards to products. In a white paper on Artificial Intelligence, the European Commission highlighted the importance of suitably amending the Product Liability Directive to enhance security related aspects for AI. The paper noted that the existing product safety legislation already protects against all kinds of risks arising from the product according to its use, including Al products. However; it noted that certain amendments may be introduced in the Product Liability Directive to address risks arising out of new technologies: These amendments   include 50

risk assessment; human oversight at the time of design, requirements addressing the risk of faulty data at the design stage and provisions discussing and requesting cooperation between economic operators in the supply chain to ensure that safety standards are adequately preserved. Singapore The privacy and security regime in Singapore is consolidated under a single law the Personal Data Protection Act, 2013 (PDPA) Regulating privacy issues in Al is rooted in two core data protection principles, consent  obligation and purpose limitation.55 The Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) is Singapore's data protection regulator PDPC published a revised Model Artificial Intelligence Governance Framework (Framework) in 2019, containing a roadmap for data protection compliance for organizations deploying AI The PDPA also requires an organization to protect personal data in its possession or under its control by employing such reasonable security arrangements' to prevent unauthorized access to data and mitigate   similar risks. These arrangements also intend to cover an assessment of the adequacy of existing safeguards, with the PDPC stressing the importance of covering all foreseeable scenarios that can potentially lead to a data breach/security risk to the personal data.56 Towards this, it proposed a framework that stressed on the importance of having a 'human in the loop' or a 'human over the loop' based on the degree of severity and harm occasioned by the particular processing of personal data.57 The equivalent  data   protection standard for cross-border transfers is also adopted by the PDPA Businesses deploying Al systems in a manner that moves personal data from one jurisdiction to another must ensure that the entity receiving such data is bound by a series of safeguards that provide the same standard of data protection as the PDPA itself. The Model Al Governance Framework (Model Framework) , was drafted based on a discussion paper issued by the Personal Data Protection Commission and part of Singapore's National Al Strategy.58 It provides a means for entities 55.

employing Al to demonstrate their implementation of the accountability-based practices in data management and protection contained therein.59 It focuses on prospective accountability by making internal governance processes robust and demonstrating to customers and regulators that the entity has employed practices to foster accountability among the designers and operators of Al, and to ensure that the Al systems, applications and algorithms are transparent and fair in their operation, while providing information and explanation to consumer about where and how Al is being used with respect to their data or services and products made available to them. In 2018, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) published the Principles to Promote Fairness, Ethics, Accountability and Transparency in the Use of Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics in Singapore's Financial Sector (FEAT Principles) specifically aimed at the use of Al for financial services: The FEAT Principles have identified the proactive disclosure of the use of Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (AIDA) to data subjects as a principle to ensure transparency in the context of data protection for AI USA The US government; through Executive Order 13859 in February 2019, issued a series of directions to various federal stakeholders to develop and principles that  promote advancement of Al based  technology while also protecting civil liberties.60 Pursuant to this Executive Order; the White House in January 2020, issued a set of 10 'Principles for the Stewardship of Al Applications, which called for; among others, fairness and non-discrimination to be priorities for agencies drafting and implementing regulations on Al.61 Unlike Singapore and the EU, the US lacks an overarching federal legislation on privacy: However; various sector laws regulate aspects of privacy: The state of California, which has recognized privacy as a constitutional right, enacted a comprehensive legislation , the California Consumer  Privacy Act, 2018 (CCPA) providing for certain safeguards that directly affect Al systems. Like Singapore and EU, businesses deploying Al systems would be obligated to notify users of the purposes of such processing with users being able to withdraw their consent from such processing: 59. https l/ai.bsa.org/wp-contentluploads/2019/09/Model-Al-Framework-First-Edition-pdf 60. https:/ /www.whitehouse-gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-maintaining-american-leadership-artificial-intel- ligencel 61. https:/ /www.whitehouse-gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Draft-OMB-Memo-on-Regulation-of-Al-1-7-19-pdf 52 key policies top specific

Appendix 3 Model Transparency Mechanisms Model Cards Google released the Model Card Toolkit, a toolset designed to facilitate Al model transparency reporting for developers, regulators, and downstream users: It's based on Google's Model Cards framework, which provide a structured framework for reporting on ML model provenance, usage, and ethics-informed evaluation and give a detailed overview of a models suggested uses and limitations that can benefit developers,  regulators, and  downstream users alike. 62 Model cards are aimed at both experts and non-experts. Developers can use them to design applications that emphasize a model's strengths while avoiding or informing end users of its weaknesses: For journalists and industry analysts, might provide insights that make it easier to explain complex technology to a general audience And might even help advocacy groups better understand the impact of Al on their communities. Google has designed examples for two features of its Cloud Vision API, Face Detection and Object Detection. provide overviews of both models' ideal forms of input, visualize some of their limitations, and present basic performance metrics. Both are early proofs of concept, to advance the conversation around the value of transparency in Al.63 Datasheets for Datasets The machine learning community currently has no standardized process for documenting datasets, which can lead to severe consequences in high-stakes domains: To address this gap, Microsoft proposed datasheets for datasets In the electronics industry, every component, no matter how simple or complex, is accompanied with a datasheet that describes its operating characteristics, test results, recommended uses, and other information. By  analogy, it is 62. https:/ /arxivorg/pdf/1810.03993-pdf 63. https:l/modelcards withgoogle com/about 53 they they They key

proposed that every dataset be accompanied with a datasheet that documents its motivation, composition, collection process, recommended uses, and SO on. Datasheets for datasets will facilitate better communication between dataset creators and dataset consumers, and encourage the machine learning community to prioritize transparency and accountability: 64 Fact Sheet The of IBMs Fact Sheet project is to foster trust in Al by increasing transparency and enabling governance: Increased transparency provides information for Al consumers to better understand how the Al model was created. This allows a consumer of the model to determine if it is appropriate for their situation. AI Governance enables an enterprise to specify and enforce describing how an Al model or service should be constructed and deployed. This can prevent undesirable situations, such as a model training with unapproved datasets, models having biases, or models having unexpected performance variations: A Fact Sheet is a collection of relevant information (facts) about the creation and deployment of an Al model or service. Facts could range from information about the purpose and criticality of the model, measured characteristics of the dataset; model, or service , or actions taken during the creation and deployment process of the model or service.65 64. https://arxivorg/pdf/1803.09010.pdf 65. https://aifs360.mybluemixnet/introduction 54 goal policies

National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Qatar EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Artificial Intelligence (Al) based technologies have been steadily permeating into our lives. However; this is just the beginning: Al has the potential of upending how we conduct our lives, how the economy is transacted, and how our communities are organized. In this document we provide an overview of Al in the context of Qatar as a country, identify the pillars to build a great Al research and innovation ecosystem in Qatar and follow those with recommendations for action: Our vision is to have Al so pervasive in all aspects of life, business and governance in Qatar that everyone looks up to Qatar as a role model for seamlessly transitioning into an Al+X future. Qatar: Al+X Future Race for Talent Al Augmented Jobs Knowledge Economy Strong academic and Encourage local businesses Attractive jurisdiction experiential learning to embrace new Al solutions. to incorporate Al-driven curriculum for the Al+X businesses: future. Invest in people and their Lead and participate in ideas for Qatar's future international efforts to Doha as a global hub through training, immersive standardize the use of Al: for attracting Al talent: experiences and startup funds Data and Computing Infrastructure Launch and lead multilateral level diplomatic efforts for data-sharing among countries with small populations. World-class cloud and computing infrastructure with strict data-residency requirements. Ethics and Governance of AI Strong ""Al Ethics and Governance"" framework rooted in local context and aligned to international norms. Guidelines for the level of explainability required for different types of decisions made by Al algorithms: key

INTRODUCTION Qatar needs an overarching Al strategy that supports the national vision and is rooted in its local context: The goal of this strategy is to leverage Al to secure Qatar's economic and strategic future, as envisioned in QNV2030,and prepare the society for effective adoption of Al technology that is aligned with local needs and traditions. The Al Strategy is structured around six thematic pillars which together will guide Qatar to transform itself for an Al+X Future. The moniker ""Al+X"" refers to the emerging consensus that Al technology will permeate into all secular aspects of human endeavors: health, entertainment; business activity, education and research. Modern Al is predicated on the use of data as a strategic resource. Raw data needs to be coupled with technological capability to produce new Al-driven products which will transform the normative basis of how societies operate and function. Having invested heavily in an education and research infrastructure, Qatar is poised to play a leadership role in an Al+X Future. THE GLOBAL AI RACE Artificial Intelligence (Al) is a transformative technology of the 21st century and one of the main arenas in which nations of the world will compete: The CEO of Google has stated that Al may be ""more important than fire or electricity:"" This is an exaggeration, but it has become very clear that Al will transform all facets of human society education, healthcare, transportation, business, entertainment; warfare, and more. The origins of Al lie in the USA and the most recent developments in the field have come from North America: However; other countries are vying for ""Al superpower"" status. China aims to be the global leader in Al by 2030 and is investing heavily to achieve this goal, especially in the use of ""Data"" as a strategic asset. Countries such as Canada, Japan; and the UK have also adopted Al strategies that aim at global leadership. Other countries such as Denmark; Taiwan, and South Korea have developed Al strategies that do not necessarily aim at global leadership, but rather at promoting the use of Al throughout society and developing Al solutions for local needs'. Increasing local Al adoption is the beginning of a journey to become competitive as a society in the global economy: The leadership in many advanced countries have concluded that capacity building in Al technology is vital for a sustainable and viable economy: As Al's leverage increases in a connected world economy, we will increasingly see a winner takes all"" trend dominating in businesses. This will have a serious implication on how nations, organizations, or even individuals think about building Al capacity and applications that are viable. In a world where innovative ideas and software can originate anywhere and thrive, excellence is not just a lofty goal to achieve but a necessary requirement: There is no escape from excellence in the impending Al future:

Page 5:

National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Qatar WHY QATAR SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN THE AI RACE Qatar is a forward looking nation and has a clearly stated vision of using its economic advantage derived from fossil fuels to transform itself into a knowledge-based economy: Indeed, the investments that Qatar has already made in research and development efforts in Al can serve as a foundation to build strong capabilities in the area and provide a head start to make globally recognized Al-based solutions. For Qatar; following are the threats and opportunities in an Al future: Threats In Qatar; economic diversification has been identified as an inescapable step towards becoming knowledge-driven society: This implies that Qatar must become globally competitive in selective niche areas. As Al permeates into all sectors f human activity, not competing in the Al arena will significantly hurt Qatar's plans of diversification. Al-enabled automation will have a profound impact on the employment landscape in all countries As Qatari citizens are overwhelmingly employed in administrative white collar occupations, the threat of job tasks becoming susceptible to automation is very real in Qatar: Opportunities Qatar has a small; educated and information technology savvy population. Using Al derived automation to augment human capability that enhances both capacity and capability of the Qatari workforce is entirely possible in a reasonably short time horizon. By making judicious investment in Al technology, Qatar can accrue downstream benefits by owning the future ""means of production"".

Al SPRING BIG DATA, ALGORITHMS, AND CLOUD The term Artificial Intelligence is not new: It was coined in the summer of 1956 by a group of renowned American scientists?. However; the field of Al in its early days had a history of over-promising and under delivering: The public in the 1950's and 60's were fascinated by promises of ""thinking machines"" that can understand language; play chess, and diagnose diseases, only to be disappointed when none of these predictions materialized in a meaningful way: This led to periods of disenchantment with Al and withdrawal of funding for Al projects, the so called ""Al Winters."" Since the 1990s Al has been able to deliver on its promises and there has been a much better understanding of its capabilities and its limitations. A narrow form of Al grounded in data has taken root and won over skeptics. Al was finally able to beat a world chess champion, drive a car autonomously, and defeat the two greatest champions in the Jeopardyl game show:. Al became an integral part of many technologies such as web search engines, natural language processing, logistics optimization, robotics, and medical diagnosis. The period since 2011 onwards can be truly called an ""Al Spring:"" Al is no longer a technology component, but rather the main enabler for many business and scientific solutions, from image recognition to self- driving cars to targeted political advertisements. The confluence of Big Data, algorithms and access to cheap computing power through cloud computing has created: The Virtuous Cycle Enabling Al Revolution Computing power Big Data Computers become Over the last two years increasingly powerful alone 90% of the data in and inexpensive the world was generated every year Al Algorithms New algorithms learn from many data examples but require extensive computing power

Page 7:

PILLARS OF QATAR'S AI STRATEGY The National Al strategy of Qatar has six pillars: education; data access, employment; business, research, and ethics It envisions two roles for Qatar: First; Qatar must become capable of producing world class Al applications in areas of national interest and have a business environment enabling the use Al as a driver for innovation. Second, Qatar must be an efficient consumer of Al, with a properly educated citizenry, sound laws, and ethical guidelines. The national Al strategy would be a powerful technological enabler for the Qatar National Vision 20304. QNV 2030 is itself organized around four pillars: economic, social, human, and environmental, and Al is indispensable for all the four pillars. For example, the economic pillar calls for the development of a 'knowledge-based economy:"" By investing in Al education and homegrown Al solutions, the effort to ground the economy on knowledge capital can be accelerated: Similarly, developing an endogenous Al-based capacity for promoting transportation efficiency can help reduce pollution and foster environmental development: There are six pillars that we have identified for Qatar's Al strategy: These cover all aspects of Al relevant to Qatar and provide a framework for organizing action plans and investments in the future:

Page 8:

Pillar 1: Race for Talent in the ""Al+X"" Era Developing and even using Al technology requires special skills that are in short supply all over the world. Al is likely to be embedded in all aspects of human activity, a phenomenon that can be called ""Al+X"". There is massive demand for Al talent; driving up salaries and creating intense competition among companies to hire in Al related roles such as data scientists and software engineers. Data science and Al courses at major universities and through online providers attract literally thousands of students: Thus, the first pillar of Qatar's national Al strategy should be education and training: Qatar is uniquely positioned to reap the benefits of Al. More than 94% of the Qatari population uses the Internet; one of the highest rates in the world. Widespread Internet usage indicates that Qatari citizenry is constantly being exposed to Al-enabled technology including computer vision, language and speech processing and digital maps. When it comes to Al, the future has already arrived. Designing and producing Al-products that are optimized for local needs and usage is not as far-fetched as it might seem and can be enabled by necessary education and training: Al+X Paradigm: Al education should be an integral part of the curriculum at all educational levels in all disciplines. At the K-12 level, younger students should learn to deal with the recommendations of Al. For example, Al typically provides its recommendations in the form of probabilities, so students should learn the basics of decision-making in the face of uncertainty: The move away from sense-based towards intellectual perception is rooted in medieval Islamic philosophys. Students should also learn about interacting with Al as part of their environment: For example, learning to reject the recommendations of Al that clearly disagree with common sense. Older students should have the opportunity to learn technical and philosophical aspects of Al. It is also important to ""teach the teachers""about Al by developing professional learning courses or online training: At the university level, computing-related departments should prepare their graduates for careers in STEM and Al disciplines. Other academic departments should be attuned to the use of Al in their disciplines and educate their graduates to be prepared when encounter it: Al education also encompasses Al coursesor boot camps that prepare those already in the workforce to work in Al-related jobs, especially if their current jobs can be replaced by Al. In addition, management and executive training that educates business leaders on the necessary basics of Al should be availables. Finally, in addition to growing Iocal Al talent; Qatar should attract top Al international talent in education, research, and entrepreneurship by introducing fast-track residency permits and creating a tech-friendly investment environment: RECOMMENDATIONS: Develop a strong academic and experiential learning curriculum for the Al+X future (i.e-, projects/ activity driven) for K-12 to build local capacity for managing interactions with Al, imagining/planning Al solutions from a young age, and building strong foundations in computational methods and STEM curriculum to develop Al applications in the future. Quantify the amount of necessary talent required in STEM disciplines to inculcate an Al ecosystem: Design degree programs with in-built apprenticeship pathways (e.g-, Al based medicine) where students can interact with researchers and businesses for building Qatar-relevant Al applications: Promote a vibrant research and entrepreneurship ecosystem for innovative Al applications that naturally align with Qatar's national interest: Adopt strategies for attracting top Al talent from all over the world such as: internationally competitive incentives, fast-track residency, easy yet well-regulated data access to facilitate innovation, and policies to encourage integration of locally developed Al solutions. they

National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Qatar Pillar 2: Data Access is Paramount The current Al revolution is based on Big Data, and modern Al models require large amounts of data to train them: Data is the key asset that underpins the resurgence in Al and its usage and release needs to be strategically shepherded: One way for Qatar to quickly gain an Al advantage is to develop data governance rules and guidelines that facilitate broad access to and sharing of data consistent with the recently released Qatar Data Privacy Laws? . Data sharing among organizations or even within an organization is impeded by two considerations. First; data has strategic and monetary value to the organization there is a saying that ""data is the new oil8 Second, data sharing can violate the privacy of users. People with data are (justifiably) worried about these two considerations when they share data, so the tendency is not to share Data release and sharing needs to be driven by a strategic imperative of enabling and promoting local Al ecosystem: For example, China has been at the forefront of using data as a strategic tool to promote indigenous technology: Data is the ""new source code"" and this perspective needs to be adopted by decision-makers in Qatar: Qatar has the unique advantage of being a small country that is well connected administratively: This makes development of broad data sharing guidelines possible, and it can be one of the competitive advantages of Qatar in the area of AI. RECOMMENDATIONS: Qatar should create a data strategy office responsible for educating government and business organizations and developing guidelines for the use of data as a strategic resource. Qatar should develop guidelines for data sharing that encourage people with data to share it and make clear the best practices for doing so. The guidelines should spell out the obligations of the receiver of the data. For government entities, these guidelines can be elevated to be mandatory policies. Qatar should launch and lead multilateral level diplomatic efforts for data-sharing among countries with small populations. For most countries including Qatar; developing successful Al applications that can generate export revenue won't be possible without greater data sharing at a global level. There is no such multilateral initiative in the world, hence this is an opportunity for Qatar to take a leadership role: Being a small country with a very diverse population, Qatar should leverage locally collected data by integrating and curating in ways that allow it to be repurposed and hence democratizes development of novel futuristic applications.

Pillar 3: The Changing Landscape of Employment There is an intense ongoing debate among experts about the impact that Al technology will have on the future of employment and jobs in the coming years. The extreme view is that Al technology will result in massive employment disruption as many tasks that currently require human involvement have the potential of being replaced by Al. In a highly cited work carried out by researchers at Oxford University, over 40% of jobs in the US are under risk of becoming automated? Economic theory suggests that the long-term financial returns on capital tend to be higher than labor and thus those who own capital will benefit disproportionately from Al technology: This has the potential of causing social upheaval and disequilibrium. The impact of Al technology on Qatar is likely to be very different from what other countries may experience: In fact; Qatar can leverage the Al revolution to realize its vision of transforming into knowledge based economy by carefully investing in strategically important Al technologies  Qatar is home to around 2.5 million people out of which approximately 10% are local Qataris and the rest are non-Qataris who reside in the country specifically on the basis of employment: Most Qataris working outside the military and security forces have white-collar occupations, primarily in the public sector: Many of these white-collar jobs are, in principle, susceptible to outright Al replacement or Al augmentation""o . For example, according to the 2016 Qatar Labor Survey, 23% of the Qatari male and 28% of the Qatari female workforce is employed in clerical positions"" . Single-skill white-collar positions such as these are most susceptible to automation: However; nearly 40% of economically active Qataris have a university education one of the highest rates in the world. By embracing Al and encouraging its citizens to be Al-skilled, Qatar can become one of the first countries in the world where citizens and Al technology can work together in harmony: Sidra Medicine 10

Page 11:

National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Qatar Consider the example of Qatar's burgeoning medical tourism industry: Qatar is ranked 30thin the world1z for medical tourism and is rapidly developing a world-class medical infrastructure with several hospitals having already obtained highly sought after international accreditation. Al technology can help Qatar accelerate the growth in medical tourism and provide knowledge jobs for Qatari citizens and residents. For example, international standards for the ratio of nurses to patients range from 1:1 to 1:6 depending on the nature of the medical treatment: However; many of the procedural tasks that a nurse carries out, like checking patient health parameters and delivery of medication, can be automated by existing Al technology: The replacement of these tasks will not only be cost-efficient; but will lead to higher quality of service as machines are likely to make fewer human errors"" . Similarly Qatar is home to people from over eighty countries and there are at least eight large subpopulations which speak distinct languages An Al-based speech and language translation system for medical communication can be built bottom up in Qatar and exported to the rest of the world. However; the more human-interaction aspects of the nurse and patient relationship cannot be automated and Qatari residents can be trained to carry out this particular aspect of the nursing function: Thus, the augmentation of a nurse's job with Al technology can be used to admit more patients per nurse, provide higher quality of care, and create specialized knowledge-intensive jobs. History shows that once the cost of using a new technology falls below a certain threshold then that technology rapidly permeates through society13. It is hard to predict what new applications will emerge that will take advantage of the emerging Al technology: What remains constant is that economics is often the driver of technology adoption: One of the factors affecting the cost of adopting Al in Qatar compared to other countries is the ability of Qatar to import low cost labor from the developing world. Thus, the cost of labor intensive and inefficient solutions is often less than the cost of an Al solution leading to a situation where long-term efficiencies are sacrificed for short-term benefits. RECOMMENDATIONS: Provide financial incentives to local businesses to embrace new Al solutions and resist the temptation of using loW-cost labor as a substitute for embracing Al technology: Educate/ Train Qatari citizens in managing, building and investing in Al solutions for continuously improving the standards of living and economic productivity in Qatar: key

Pillar 4: New Business and Economic Opportunities Qatar has a modern; diverse, technology-driven business landscape. Besides a world leading oil and gas industry, Qatar is home to a major international airline, an influential financial sector; and a robust power generation enterprise. Al will transform the economic and business landscape in Qatar; and the national Al strategy should address this transformation: Al is already being adopted by businesses worldwide; McKinsey estimates that global technology companies such as Google and Baidu spent a total of S20-30 billion on Al in 201614. These technology companies are the early adopters of Al, but investment in Al is also happening in other sectors such as financial services, manufacturing, and agriculture: Early adopters are already seeing the benefits of Al, which is accelerating adoption by other companies. The national Al strategy of Qatar should enable existing businesses to adopt Al, and catalyze the creation of new businesses based on Al technology: For example, the Qatari government can provide guidelines and best practices for businesses that plan to adopt Al, or even direct financial and technical assistance to these businesses to help them in adopting Al technologies. Startup funds and incubators should be directed to focus on Al-based companies. Since data is essential for modern Al, enabling access to the data that businesses need for developing their Al models can be a major driver of the adoption of Al in businesses. The other component of modern Alis a powerful computing infrastructure. This infrastructure can be partly provided by the private sector but the government needs to play a role in ensuring that the computing infrastructure available to businesses is powerful enough to meet the demands of Al. For example; the internet connectivity within Qatar and internationally should support the capacity requirements of Al. The government can accelerate the adoption of Al in the business sector by adopting Al in its own public services That way businesses interfacing with Al-enabled public services will feel the need to become Al-enabled themselves: In addition, Al-enabled public services can be a quick success for Al that is felt by Qatari citizens. The Qatari government has a solid foundation on which to base Al adoption in public services, since Qatar already has a strong digital government; with services such as Metrash, Hukoomi; and Baladiya/Oun""5. It is befitting to augment these services with Al capabilities, resulting in more efficient service delivery that better responds to citizens' needs. RECOMMENDATIONS: Make investment commitments to develop programs for leveraging Al in areas of strategic importance for Qatar; e.g., oil and gas. Build a regulatory and incentive framework that is stable, and makes Qatar an attractive jurisdiction to incorporate by Al driven businesses around the globe: Develop and maintain cutting edge computing and connectivity infrastructure with a high degree of resilience. Launch and participate in international efforts to bring standardization in all aspects of AI, e.g-, network and systems architecture; data and application integration protocols, requirements on test case coverage, services, etc. that ensure a level playing field. 12

National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Qatar Pillar 5: Qatar Al + X Focus Areas In some cases,it is appropriate to procure existing Al solutions and deploy them in Qatar: However; there will be cases where it is imperative to develop local homegrown Al solutions. The reason can be that the solution addresses specific local needs of Qatar; that Qatar is uniquely positioned to be a global leader in developing the solution, or that the solution is highly strategic and must be controlled locally: Qatar must ensure it has global Al research leadership in areas of national interest; and that local technology enterprises have sufficient technical capacity to develop Al solutions. Some example areas where it is imperative for Qatar to develop local Al solutions are as follows Arabic Language Processing: As an Arabic speaking country, the use of Al Arabic language processing should be a national priority for Qatar: Qatar has a wealth of content in Arabic that can be used to develop Al models, and Arabic language processing capabilities can enable impactful applications in education, media, security, and other areas of strategic importance. To illustrate, Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI) has developed multiple Arabic language processing systems such as an automatic speech-to-text system for Arabic that is in use by the Al Jazeera media network, a suite of Arabic text processing tools known as Farasa that is considered the best in the world, and a powerful Arabic-to-English translation system: Qatar can be a world leader in the use of Al for Arabic language processing and generation. National Security: Cyber security has become an Al problem. Advanced techniques for identifying and mitigating cyber threats depend to a high degree on data analytics and AI. Additionally, using Al to analyze publicly available data can provide advanced warning of threats. Such highly strategic infrastructure should rely on homegrown and locally controlled solutions. Signals from social-media now constitute a major focus of attention by intelligence agencies around the world to infer security threats to a nation. By building local systems, which correlate network, and social media traffic can go a long way in creating another layer of security for Qatar Precision Medicine and Systems Biology: Al will radically transform the way healthcare and medicine is practiced. The holy grail of personalized and precision medicine and the concept of ""from bench to bedside"" is realizable with AI. A consensus is emerging within the medical research community that a systems biology perspective which harnesses multiomic (genomic, proteomic, metabolomics) data is necessary to make next generation medical breakthroughs: The Qatar Genome Project provides fine-grained data about citizens f Qatar and should serve as the basis of uncovering persistent disease patterns in the local population: A high rate of consanguinity in the local population makes the Qatar genome data highly unique and its usage and release needs to be strategically guided. More lifestyle and clinical data can be acquired from wearable devices, electronic health records and even social media. High quality data with world class medical and bioinformatics research infrastructure; including Hamad Medical Corporation, Sidra Medicine; Weill-Cornell Medicine-Qatar; QBRI, and QCRI, can catapult Qatar to the forefront of personalized medicine, emergency services, and Al based medical education and research. 13 for along

Transportation and FIFA World Cup 2022: Qatar is undergoing a rapid expansion in transportation infrastructure, whether it is road networks, the new Hamad Port and Airport; and expansion of Qatar Airways and Qatar Rail. This is a unique opportunity to in place Al-enabled infrastructure from the get go. Additionally, Al can help in managing the logistics challenges of World Cup 2022,and enhance the experience of fans in the stadium and viewers at home. These Al use cases would then help build the tourism industry post 2022. Through it TASMUI6 program, the MoTC has already proposed several use cases to transform Qatar into a digitally ""smart' nation. Many of these use cases already have a strong data-driven focus Using Al Qatar can become a role model for sustainable urban development by cutting emissions in energy production and manufacturing from its current globally highest per capita levels Food Security: Food Security has been identified as a national priority by Qatar: There is a tremendous potential for applying Al technology at the food-energy-water nexus and many countries, mostly notably the Netherlands, have taken the lead in promoting next generation precision agriculture and vertical farming techniques. There is a to generate massive amounts of data at the finest granularity level in agriculture and create customized water and fertilizer usage plans which increases crop yield and is environment friendly at the same time. Al will play a big role in achieving food security in Qatar and everywhere in the future when severe strain on yields and arable land is expected due to climate change. Furthermore Qatar should develop customized Al-driven simulations to prepare contingency plans to maintain food supply pipelines in face of regional disruptions and threats. Oil and Gas: Qatar's mature oil and gas industry stands to benefit significantly from AI. Qatar-based companies have access to the most fine-grained logging data from gas operations which can be leveraged to create niche Al-products in the oil and gas sector: For example the use of this data to develop solutions for predictive maintenance enabled could help realize tremendous efficiency gains and reduce production downtimes. Al will also enable data driven revenue management and logistics optimization: RECOMMENDATIONS: Build applications using Arabic language processing for business use cases to become the leader in this domain among the Arab nations: Leverage Al expertise available within the country in strategically important domains for Qatar like oil and gas, transportation; health, and cybersecurity to build competitive advantage in specific use cases that could also generate export revenues in the future: Use FIFA 2022 to collect data and pilot Al application ideas that could also benefit Qatar in the run_ 14 put push long

National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Qatar Pillar 6: Ethics and public policy The increasing pervasiveness of Al in our personal lives and work poses many ethical and public policy questions Al methods tend to acquire ""black box' characteristics and sometimes are not amenable to fairness, accountability and transparency principles that are vital for the long-term viability of societies and countries. Al algorithms will inherit any biases' consecrated in data and mechanisms are required that guarantee outputs which are consistent with societal norms""7. Transparency and accountability require Al models to be explainable, i.e,, the output of an Al algorithm be describable in plain natural language: Explainability and Interpretability in Al is emerging as an important Al research topic in its own right: For example consider an Al algorithm that decides how patients should be prioritized to receive scarce organ transplants. If a ""pure data"" solution is used then an algorithm may inadvertently use longevity as a criterion and rank the patients based primarily on age. Modern Al relies on data including personally identifiable information (PII). For many technological companies the user is a product and advertisers are the customers who pay a fee to access user information: There is an increasing worldwide to treat private information as a human right and Qatar should use the recently introduced General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by the European Union as a template to introduce guidelines that protect its citizens from online exploitationI8. Qatar's Ministry of Transportation and Communication (MoTC) and previously ictQatar (which is now part of MoTC) had issued guidelines for Qatar on privacy and data sharing that are in alignment with Qatar's traditions and ambitions These would form an excellent starting to develop a larger and comprehensive set of guidelines for the country: RECOMMENDATIONS: The Qatari government should introduce guidelines for the level of explainability and interpretability required for different types of decisions made by Al algorithms: Build up from the existing guidelines on privacy, data sharing, etc. developed by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MoTC) and previously ICT Qatar: Qatar should develop an ""Al Ethics and Governance"" framework for addressing ethical and public policy questions, which will become increasingly important as the use of Al expands into sensitive areas of society such as policing, courts, health, and warfare: The framework to be developed must be consistent with both Qatari social, cultural, and religious norms and international guidelines while ensuring that Qatar emerges as a leading proponent of AI. 15 push point

CONCLUSION The proposed strategy provides specific recommendations for the leadership of Qatar to set course, embark and flourish in the brave new world of Artificial Intelligence. Globally, the consensus has been building that the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the next technological inflection point at par with the industrial revolution, the benefits and consequences of which we are still witnessing: Those who can develop mastery in using and developing Al applications will reap its benefits and thrive. Qatar is well positioned to take advantage of this golden opportunity and become a critical player in the Al economy of the future. However; we need to act with a sense of urgency to realize this opportunity before it becomes too late as the Al race among countries is becoming very competitive. Qatar needs to act on the recommendations listed under the six pillars of the proposed national AI strategy to ensure it builds sustainable competitive advantages and remains a critical player in the global economy and society: This would require significant investments in the education and retraining of its citizenry to augment their existing capabilities with Al technologies and build an ecosystem conducive to developing path breaking Al technologies in Qatar: HBKU Research Complex 16

The term ""Artificial Intelligence' was first used in 1956 and is attributed to John McCarthy, then a young assistant professor of mathematics at Dartmouth College, who organized workshop named the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence"" in the summer of 1956. McCarthy also co-invented the LISP programming language, which is popular in AI. An interesting perspective is provided by Jerry Kaplan's informative 2016 book, ""Artificial Intelligence: What everyone needs to know"" 3. Three highly popularized examples of Al defeating championship players in games of intelligence are IBM's Deep Blue defeating chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1996, IBMs Watson defeating champions Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings in the quiz show Jeopardyl in 2011,and Google's AlphaGo defeating Go legend Lee Sedol in 2016. 4.

TASMU https /LWWwtasmugQvqa/en 17. The social and ethical ramifications of Al are receiving significant attention from research and public policy organizations: For example, the Al Now Institute at New York University (https LLainowinstitute orgL) has recently published a report outlining specific public policy recommendations to address ethical issues related to Al (https /Lainowinstitute org/AL_Now_2018_Report pdf): The European Commission has drafted ethics guidelines for trustworthy Al (https /Lec europa eulnewsroom/daeL document cfm?doc_id-56433). These activities can inform the development of Qatar's strategy: However; it is important to note that many of the ethical issues related to Al have to be studied in the context of local cultural norms For example, a recent Nature paper that studied people's perception of what constitutes ethical Al actions in a particular context revealed significant cultural and demographic variations in what people perceive as ""the ethical thing to do"" (https ILWWWnature comlarticles/s41586-018-0637-6). 18.
